freelee's you can eat as much as u want isnt 00 accurate...maybe it is if you run a 0k everyday amd do alot of excersise but the foods u can really eat as much as u want of are like carrot sticks minus hummus or like apples or oranges or grapes because those will fill u up fast bc they have a lot of water so u wont really have to eat that much to be full like the whole eating a ton of rice or a whole box of pasta or  pounds of potatos or  mangos is not really healthy unless off course u do a ton of high intensity excersise...,1,NOT
regarding your weight you may notice some fluctuations in your weight because your metabolism will be changing weeks is a relatively short amount of time so i would encourage you to keep being vegan even after your music video to see how it affects your body also regarding food eat as many fruits and veggies as you want and if you are feeling hungry make sure to eat more potatoes and beans nuts are also a very good source of protein if you're worried about being protein deficient the worst thing you can do on a vegan lifestyle is starve yourself so just make sure that you are always full from healthy food good luck!,1,NOT
awesome quinoa is good for you and has protein add chia seeds to everything they fill you up have protein fiber omega 's anitoxidants i add them to oatmeal for breakfast add fruit and cinnamon chia seeds are hydroponic so if you were to add them to a smoothie drink or nut milk they expand so they fill you up i am excited for you great job!,1,NOT

hi trish i haven't been vegan long its been about half a year but so far what has helped me is eating at least one really great starchy or carb filled meal a day like pasta vegan pizza or potatoes something like that it makes you feel so great and energized and won't send you into like a funk eat a variety beans different colors of veg and fruit so you get all the nutrients you need and that's how you actually feel great don't feel pressured to need to fit a vegan structure like raw or hclf in the beginning it is easiest to just start by eating vegan foods that you like just so you don't feel as restricted in the beginning especially for these weeks la is so great for vegan foods i live in china and it is way harder here p good luck!,1,NOT

try making noodle stir fry's rice pasta with tomato-based sauces and other carby things because to maintain a fully raw all fruit and veggie diet you have to eat sooo much to start off you should try eating meals like the above to transition so it doesn't feel like a shock if you go cold-turkey raw i guarantee you won't stay vegan ),1,NOT

it's actually really common for people to gain weight when they first go vegan/vegetarian because their body is used to being deprived of nutrients from calorie deficiency dieting starving yourself) and is still storing everything as a fat reserve your body will adjust within a month or so of normal eating sufficient calories carbs and nutrients and plateau at a certain weight then you'll start losing it best way to combat the initial weight gain is to drink a lot of water and exercise daily 4 min of cardio is a good starting goal) just mentally prepare that you'll gain a bit of weight before you'll begin losing it because of your dieting habits  good luck oh and also root chips leaf cuisine spreads bomb it's healthy probiotic chips and dip and it can be used instead of creamcheese  it's vegan and dairy free if you want to substitute soda try kombucha as well ],1,NOT

yesss!! im so happy for u trish!! be sure to have lots of grains also don't be discouraged in the beginning if you gain little bit of weight because your body is getting used to the metabolism from the vegan diet but eventually you'll start dropping the pounds a lot when i went vegan i am lost  pounds within the first two weeks so but i was vegetarian first so it was a little healthier than a carniat so just be aware that you might gain a little bit at first but then you'll start shedding off the weight nonstop! good luck!!!,1,NOT

i don't think you'll see the results you want from going vegan in just weeks i've been on the diet for about months and i've lost  pounds my skin looks clearer no more zits i feel a lot healthier in general it took a long time though to get into a good rhythm with food i did so much research and watched so many food diaries on youtube i think it's a good step but you're not going to reap the benefits you want off of this diet in just weeks you might not even lose weight freelee looks great but she also exercises a lot she's very active i do think as a vegan you need to find a balance your body needs fats and oils which freelee is against i use coconut oil to cook with and extra virgin olive oil i also eat avocados and almonds to get my fats in i still eat between 20 calories a day to 60 depending on my daily activity and because i'm dieting a little i don't think everyone can just eat as many calories as they like from fruit and veggies and lose weight doing it everyone's lifestyle is different get your veggies in for sure my food diary usually consists of eating almonds with all natural organic peanut butter i'll have a smoothie with bananas frozen berries hemp protein almond milk sometimes a date or then other days i'll switch my bananas for an avocado with spinach and berries and coconut water for lunch and dinner i usually eat similar things it could be a veggie burger pasta with veggies quinoa or brown rice with veggies i like spicy foods so if you're like me you'll enjoy this snack i buy peppers and red pepper hummus and just dip peppers into that and omg it's so good if i'm craving chocolate i usually buy some organic dark chocolate put it in the freezer and snap off a piece now and then always make sure you read the back of the label with everything you buy there's lots of information out there immerse yourself in research and you'll do great also if you're craving meat i'd buy meat from morning star or gardien for cheese always go with chao cheese it's the only cheese brand so far that's impressed me don't expect the fake meats and cheese to be identical to the real stuff it's different just still tasty in it's individual way.,1,NOT
im so disapointed in you trish i love you but i love chicken better how can people not eat chicken or bacon or ham fuck saving the animals i don't see lions going vegan if i walked past one of them fuckers theyd have one hell of a feast hahaha but honestly well done trish for trying this its something i could and will never do not for all the money in the world.,2,NOT

"gardein products are great especially as you transition and might struggle to come up with meal ideas you can not eat as many calories as you want i've found that to be very misleading in this community use an online calorie calculator to get a general idea of what you should be eating or better yet get your rmr tested and know for sure how many calories your body burns at rest still pay attention to your macros at each meal nothing crazy just try to include a healthy protein at each meal) <this is what has worked for me you'll get ,00 different answers but you'll have to tweak it to find what works best for you -)",1,NOT

yay! congratulations trisha! the next weeks even if it is just that will save the lives of many animals  losing weight as a vegan in my experience the freelee-worshippers will differ is mostly veggies and fruits a smoothie for breakfast a brown rice wrap with tomato lettuce avocado spinach arugula a smear of hummus or vegan cream cheese kite hill only good brand for lunch and a small pasta kite hill even has ricotta cheese ravioli if you get a cheesy craving for dinner we have as much junk food and fattening food as any other diet if you eat just oreos and vegan ice cream potato chips nudge most bbq salt and vinegar and original flavored are vegan you won't lose weight dieting as a vegan is still dieting you just get to feel more full because vegan foods tend to be less calorie dense and more filling you should expect to feel weird kind of sick then kind of good digestive changes will make you feel weird it's natural good luck girl!,1,NOT

read for all the answers you need!** and to add eat whatever and how much you want is sort of a lie to me) try to keep your calories still around the recommended 00 area and eat foods that are easy to digest for you drink lots of water no soda or anything like that keep the sodium low that will help prevent bloating the most and try to keep around below 00 mg a day 0 mg at most is best because our bodies aren't used to digesting sodium so it clings onto water cells which makes you appear bigger because then that water can't exit your system due to the bloating you can also eat starches like rice potatoes not french fries baked potatoes or even sweet potatoes are the bomb! and also oatmeal pasta whole grain! but no bread bread has a lot of sodium and it is so hard to digest pasta has nearly no sodium and oatmeal has barely 0 per serving i would also suggest to have melons and fruit as a lunch like a fruit salad and banana smoothie for lunch after a oatmeal breakfast make it with water though and calorie sweeteners aren't as bad as people think as long as its saccharin and not aspartame with lots of fruit on top i love pineapple strawberry and blueberry! and last but not least you do need to do the tiniest bit of exercise maybe walking around town or around a mall for about an hour a day will help loads okay i'm done ranting xd remember low fat less than  g a day is when i feel best high carb around 00-50 is what i usually get in a day and around 500-200 calories which is what i et around and low sodium i usually have around 00-100 mg a day and about an hour of walking and you'll do great!!! i really hope you've read this and if you have please give me feedback by replying if this has helped remember i went from 6 pounds to my lowest of 05 so i know what i'm saying ),1,NOT
but on your snapchat you just posted you eating sour cream and onion chips.. which contains milk.. so i don't know when you are actually doing this but just an fyi sour cream and onion chips contain milk...,2,NOT
trish this is so great!! i myself come from a very eating-disordered past.. for years i alternated between extreme starvation and hardcore binge eating.. which eventually just turned to binge eating all the time food became the central part of my life my entire life was planned around food and once i would binge it would be like oh well i guess that was the whole point of today anything else i do today is pointless may as well just go to bed. this all changed when i went vegan here are my tips  eat as many whole foods as you can if a fruit smoothie isn't satisfying enough for you in the morning add lots of hemp seeds and almond/cashew butter and chia seeds those will give you healthy fats and fiber increase your calorie intake and just make you feel fuller and give you a better start to your day another important ingredient for smoothies for increased energy and nutrition maca powder it makes your smoothie taste like fucking malt balls mmmm  stock up on emergency foods that are high in calories and easy to make or don't require any preparation at all) like frozen burgers burritos pizzas but also just nuts and seeds these will be your best friend when you don't have time and you need to eat something it's good to snack on nuts or dried fruit throughout the day to keep yourself from getting hungry later in the day and then bingeing on something terrible  try to throw as many greens into your food as possible you will eventually grow to crave them and this is coming from someone who was obsessed with bacon and cheese and was disgusted with vegetables lol i now crave spinach arugula and kale we humans are creatures of habit you can literally train yourself to crave healthy foods even if you can't stop eating the bad ones lol. it's best to sneak greens into a fruit smoothie especially one with really sweet fruits like mango or pineapple because then you can't even taste them  just google things like easy vegan recipes or vegan comfort food and bookmark a bunch of them for future reference get earth balance vegan mac cheese but when you prepare it with a plant milk of your choice earth balance vegan butter although it's fine without the butter honestly) add like tablespoons of nutritional yeast you can get it at whole foods for an extra cheesy flavor also look up recipes for tempeh bacon you can make bacon mac cheese with that shit soooo good there are so many great products out there obviously the best healthiest way to eat vegan especially for weight loss is to stick to eating as many whole foods as you can make everything from scratch etc for instance if you have a good blender you can make your own mac cheese from soaked raw unsalted cashews and sweet potatoes and nutritional yeast and lots of spices or alfredo from soaked cashews and cauliflower and nutritional yeast).. but there are so many great products to buy and keep in your freezer it's good to have them on hand for when you have no time and you're craving something savory and meaty. if you don't have those products as a back-up you might end up bingeing on something non-vegan and then feeling shitty about yourself although with all the vegan options at taco bell chipotle various pizza places wendy's etc you can still get tasty vegan fast food! try beyond meat and field roast meat alternatives they're so fucking good there are amazing nuggets at whole foods in the frozen food section i think they're by that whole foods brand 6 or whatever it's called take it from me a person who used to binge like crazy and was only happy when i could eat tons of bacon and cheese and pasta with cream sauce and burgers and steaks i couldn't imagine going vegan until i watched a few documentaries and freelee's videos too and decided to just fucking go for it it saved my life and now i don't even eat that healthy all the time i like meat alternatives i like frying stuff in oil etc) but i'm still thin and looking good and i don't exercise) even when i smoke pot and binge which happens often lol) my weight stays the same because it's all plant foods rich in fiber good luck!! you can do it!! 3,1,NOT

hey trish i'm also a new vegan but i have some experience as i've been a vegan for a few months now i eat a starch based vegan diet rather than what freelee eats raw till ) basically she eats an all fruit diet until pm an then she cooks a vegan meal for dinner and she's made countless videos on what she eats in a day definitely go check them out personally however what i find to be more sustainable is a starch based diet that a lot of vegans thrive on! here's an example of what i eat in a day breakfast mango smoothie i eat a smoothie for breakfast nearly every single day i freeze bananas and mangos and put them in it for a cool and creamy texture similar to icecream lunch three small brown potatoes with and asparagus broccoli and cauliflower medley i typically put a tomatoey sauce on top or sometimes barbecue sauce if i'm looking for some nice tang dinner basmati rice and black beans with an avocado sprinkled with granulated garlic i usually combine the mixture w tomatoes red onions and lime in addition i have a bit of salsa on the side snacks i only eat fruit for snacks remember to carb the fuck up if i were you i would stock up on rice legumes/beans fruit!!!! and vegetables whole grain breads and pasta and vegetable stock also try lots of lentils and stuff like quinoa the recipes are endless! also cauliflower is amazing and is good for a lot of vegan dishes i find the most of mine on pinterest it's amazing remember that you must eat in abundance on this diet and stray away from replacement items like daya cheese however if you crave those items spend the money on a vegan pizza every once in a while you will make mistakes but just remember to forgive yourself this is no temporary fix however if you want to see true long term results you must continue on a beautiful diverse whole plant based diet since my vegan transition i have lost the excess off of my stomach and see it being a lot flatter in addition my skin isn't perfect bc i do suffer from acne but it has become much more manageable and has cleared up tremendously throughout this journey you will see body results but it also teaches you how to love your body and also a lot about compassion i encourage to keep researching the vegan lifestyle and motivate yourself to continue love you trish good luck on your vegan journey!,1,NOT

you can get protein from many things like nuts soy and potatoes with skin i have been vegan for a couple years now and pasta is really filling and avocado sticks to your ribs so you will feel full for longer make sure to buy vegan bread because some bread contains egg you can also get frapp√©s with soy milk and no whip cream instead of milk i hope you read my comment and take some notes on it.,1,NOT

educate yourself eat enough calories and stock up on staples like rice potatoes beans oats etc and if you accidentally eat something not vegan it's no big deal you already did it just stop if you figured out its not vegan and continue on with life just continue to vegan veganism may seem hard at first but after you've done it for a while it becomes more than a diet and just a way of life... good luck on your vegan journey!,1,NOT
i love how this vegetarian and vegan thing is getting so big the world is literally becoming a better place y'all just keep pushing those vibes out there!,1,NOT
yay trisha!! finally! i recommend vega protein powder use almond milk i also love this app called yummly you can look up vegan recipes i like morning star or gardein for like little snacks through out the day or for dinner i also recommend yoplait yogurts because they do offer you calcium and protein or you can eat mixed nuts or dried fruit because those will also offer you protein garbanzo beans quinoa and couscous are awesome sides to have for any meal because they are super high in protein and for me i eat tofu quite often bc it's tasteless so you can use any sauce on it and it'll only taste like the sauce but the texture is like scrambled eggs it's super easy once you get the taste of all the awesome vegan foods you won't want to go back to eating meet ,1,NOT

i would suggest watching the documentary forks over knives it's very informative and shows why animal products aren't good for you and it gives you ideas of what you can eat on a vegan diet i've been vegan for four months and i recently when hclf high carb low fat and i would suggest eating whole foods definitely eat lots of carbs like bananas rice potatoes etc and do not calorie restrict a lot of vegan foods are low in calories therefore you can eat a lot more anyways i'm soooo happy for you!,1,NOT
i'm not trying to be negative but i know from experience it's hard to lose weight after just two weeks of veganism in fact you bloat a lot you're body won't be used to all the fiber and you'll actually feel like you're gaining weight and although the bloating does go down i promise it takes a while and i worry you'll be turned off it for life if you do bloat and stuff don't feel discouraged trisha you're body will thank you massively but maybe not right away you're skin will thank you right away tho you will start to fucking glow i'm not even kidding you're hair and nails will grow super quick and you will have hella energy i don't mean to put you down and i'm super proud you're giving it a go and spreading the vegan message just don't give up if it doesn't give you an immediate freelee body that's what i expected for myself and i weigh around the same as you haha love you sorry if this comes across negative xx,1,NOT

some tips for eating vegan for the next two weeks love that you're doing this and being 00lb myself this could inspire me to maybe take that step for my health  look up recipes so that you can get more protein and healthy carbs buy more whole fruits and not packaged ones so you'll get more for your money and then just cut them up all at once when you have like half an hour so they're ready to go farmers markets which i'm sure la has a lot of have cheaper produce typically buy things like brown rice oats sweet potatoes etc so you can actually stay full eat fruits and esp veggies in abundance try lots of vegan restaurants bc la is vegan heaven! cook your veggies and season them well so they taste good and you actually want to eat them kisses and i hope this works out for you!!!!,1,NOT
ymy unvle has been a vegan for about 0 years and he says that a good way to eat healthier with a vegan diet is lots of beans and nuts you can buy beyond meet products and simple truth if there is a kroger or smiths in your area and for cheese you can buy daiya products and another source of protein is seitans they are really delicious wheat protein they are great for vegetarians and vegans i hope you do well on your vegan journey and that you enjoy the healthier and satisfying things in life.,1,NOT

it won't last if you don't eat enough listen you have abused your body for years by going on these crash diets that means you have something called metabolic damage in the beginning freele gained weight as a vegan because her body wasn't used to that much food so yeah you will gain weight in the beginning but once your body has had time to heal you'll lose fat not weight but fat and that can take some time maybe a year so if you think vegansim is the solution to lose weight before your music video you're wrong i still hope you'll go vegan bc vegansim is the long term solution to weightloss and you will never have to crash diet ever again i just hope you are not going to starve yourself in order to lose weight go crazy bc of the lack of nutrients and then blame vegansim like the balanced blond did.,2,NOT

watch greatest speech you will ever hear it gave me the final push to go vegan,1,NOT
im vegan and ive got a couple of things to say about this nothing negative i promise first off i think what you said about if freelee would be nice in her youtube videos if she would people wouldnt watch when she does shocking things people do watch there are sooooo many vegan youtubers out there that are nice but none of them are as popular as freelee second what you do need to realise is that having a vegan diet wont magically make you lose weight the only thing is that vegan things are generally less dense in calories although they do fill you up thats why when people go vegan they will lose some weight in the first few weeks but then when your body starts craving those calories you will stop losing weight unless you obviously go high carb low fat like freelee because thats just a really good way to lose weight slowly and healthily and third i would recommend eating lots of fruit and not too much other food for now for these two weeks to lose weight quickly for the video but if you want to stick with it you should definitely eat more rice potatoes beans legumes bread and meat replacers since they are the things that will fill you up most and they will have enough calories to keep you going if you eat too little calories you will feel horrible and blame veganism although really youre just not eating enough and then last my favorite thing about veganism and i think yours too is you get to eat so much more even with processed food vegan things tend to have less calories so you get to eat more without having more calories i hope you'll make the right choice after these two weeks the right choice for your own health for the animals and for the planet if you want to educate yourself further i would recommend watching cowspiracy and earthlings although earthlings only shows animal abuse as where cowspiracy shows more environmental issues).,1,NOT
eat lots of greens it will help with the digestion and where you can get your protein.,1,NOT
nuts are a good protein,1,NOT

that's so great one day at a time girl 3 if you like how it feels and you know you want to eventually be a vegan for life know that it can happen and that if you go back and eat some animal product once twice a few times you don't have to throw in the towel some people go vegan overnight and stick to it but many many people don't like me if you really feel how it feels in your heart as well as physically and mentally you can get there never ever thought i'd go vegan either in the past.,1,NOT

i'm personally not vegan i'm a vegetarian but i do watch a lot of vegan and raw vegan youtubers brianna jackfruitson nickacado avacado kalel simply quinoa supreme banana just to name a few for foods i'd recommend brianna the most she has so many raw vegan meals that can easily be cooked she was fully raw for the longest time and started getting into cooked foods again there's nothing wrong with being raw but there is definitely more variety as a vegan than a raw vegan you're the best trish - i hope you stick to the diet for a while and i know you can do it!,1,NOT

for protein i make quinoa and brown rice on a weekly basis gardein has really yummy fake chicken not super healthy but a nice treat if you have a craving the beauty of a vegan diet to me is that i eat until i'm satisfied but don't experience the pain and exhaustion of overeating food my body struggles to digest dairy is a hard one to give up especially cheese to me the cheese replacements are a bit pungent i personally like saut√©ed mushrooms as an alternative the most important thing is to remember that we are all doing the best we can and wherever this journey leads you we have to have respect for one another's choices.,1,NOT

ill tell you what i learned from being vegan for years im eating meat now because my b1 was heading towards the danger zone dont let that deter you though i just sucked at being vegan lol as much as i took pride in making the food i was still a pretty lazy chef and was very uncreative when it came to eating out but these were the good bits   the best time to eat melon is either at the start of your day or when you havent eaten in a fair while as melons have a pretty high water content and will run into anything ingested before it  when i was trying i beat a lot of unhealthy food cravings by studying the contents of each thing identifying what part of the food it was that i was craving and then substituting the unhealthy thing for a healthy option chocolate craving was magnesium fast food craving was usually fat and would be replaced with an avocado nuts or whatever)  i couldnt afford vegan cheese so veg pizza with whatev i could find to add flavour was a staple,1,NOT
also almond milk is soo good when you go to starbucks replace milk with soy or coconut,1,NOT
your body has to get you to it and you might bloat at first but it will pass effortlessly don't give up veganism is actually super easy and way less expensive than meat diets you got this!,1,NOT

welcome to the vegan life here are some things that helped me when i transitioned from vegetarian to full vegan  water water water water your body is about to go on a journey so be nice to yourself and keep it clean  fruit for breakfast it's the easiest meal plan ever you can have as much as you'd like and the fruit you consume in the morning pushes out what you ate the day before  be kind to yourself this is a new lifestyle and you will make mistakes that's ok just make a mental note about what you ate don't buy it again and move on  if weight loss is your main inspiration for going vegan check out the skinny bitch books they have a sharp tone but are also funny and informative  when you can't take it any more and are seriously craving junk food remember oreos are accidentally vegan ),1,NOT

just remember you can lose weight on a vegan diet of course... you also have to take into account you past eating habits like you you said you're used to starving yourself your body is going to get used to your new diet soon i gained a little bit of weight in the beginning as i transitioned(in the past i didn't eat that much) now i eat as much as i want and the weight stays off good luck of your vegan travels  can we see a what i eat in a day vegan video ),1,NOT

beans have a lot of protein and other nutrients eat a lot of greens for vitamins along with your fruits also nuts can be a good source of calories freelee is an extreme case she has a fast metabolism most likely but more importantly she's very active so she has to eat a lot of carbs for normal people who drive around the city all day you can't just eat a bunch of carbs and think you'll get thin a lot of people becoming vegan eat too many carbs because they use starch as a replacement for meat starchy foods have a lot of calories and they turn into fat if you don't use the energy immediately you should check out the unnatural vegan's channel here on youtube she has good advice and supports everything she says with evidence which a lot of other vegan youtubers don't or they think anecdotal evidence is sufficient when it's not. i think being vegetarian is enough for me but i end up eating vegan pretty often i'm mostly concerned about the environment though i also don't eat meat because i can't support killing animals for food in good conscience so it always brightens my day up a bit when someone wants to be vegetarian or vegan good luck trish hope this finds you _^,1,NOT

good luck doll can't wait to see how this turns out for you cutting back a lot on alcohol or completely eliminating it from your diet would help immensely as well just a suggestion if you still need/want to drink do you but even if u only had one day a week that you allowed yourself to drink you would lose a good amount of wieghtüòÜ also eat more throughout the day as that speeds up your metabolism whereas if u starve yourself or only eat once or twice a day your body stores fat cuz it doesn't know when u will feed it again good luck to you doll!! xo,1,NOT

this video was filmed around june 1 is she joking by proclaiming veganism or even vegetarianism yes but i think it's based on ignorance a lot of people who become vegetarian or stick with the vegan lifestyle are cutting out meat or animal byproducts because of vicious deaths of living animals cutting out meat and/or animal byproducts can also be very good for the human body if you're maintaining a healthy and balanced meal with other nutrients but by becoming vegan/vegetarian it really begins with educating yourself on how to do so.,2,NOT
this is an old video and surely a trolling one too,3,NOT

someone told me that soy can make youre hormones go crazy does anyone know if thats true,1,NOT
my husband recently went vegan about a month ago i went more vegetarian my first shopping trip i couldn't help but laugh at myself because of how much fake meat i bought i definitely am not used to cutting out meat yet but i haven't had any real meet in a few weeks i take pictures of all the products i buy and put it on my instagram so i can track what things i actually like when i go shopping again gardein and daiya are two of my favorite brands so far.,1,NOT
check out a youtube channel called the vegan corner makes all kinds of vegan friendly dishes like lasagna brownies curry tortillas cinnabons etc.you are definitely going to want to make at least one meal instead of eating just strictly fruits and vegetables all day that's usually what i do i snack all day on fruits and veggies and make a vegan friendly meal during the part of the day where i have the most time also you're gonna hear a lot about smashing carbs and calories don't do that when you're starting out eat as much as you'd like but don't overeat to the point where you're too full that will just make you end up feeling kind of sick i have binging problems i just feel like sometimes i have a void that i need to fill so veganism is great for me because i can literally just eat and eat and not gain any weight from it those baby carrots are great for binging if you ever have an urge same with celery apples anything that requires a good amount of chewing don't be afraid to use some peanutbutter or humus with some of those things too the great thing about being vegan is you can eat two or three times the amount of salad and it'll make up one little cheeseburger from mcdonalds speaking of burgers try some veggie burgers trader joe's has pretty good ones or you could look up recommendations online even when i was a meat eater i still preferred them over an actual beef burger and don't think that just because you're vegan means you can't eat junk food you can still eat chips oreos fritos nutter butters poptarts etc just google if vegan friendly foods and you should get a huge list also continue researching on veganism in your free time you really do so much good to the world just by doing that one simple thing of choosing something different to eat for your dinner it's kind of like recycling you feel like it doesn't do much but when you join a group of people who's goal is the same it has a bigger effect than you think hope veganism goes well for you!,1,NOT
i seriously dislike freelee as a vegan i prefer to watch the unnatural vegan instead and other youtubers who use science and evidence to back up reasons for going vegan beyond animal rights) and how to make sure you don't have a bad transition track your nutrition and research places to eat to help give yourself a safety guard from accidentally meat/animal products ),1,NOT
pinterest is amazing for recipes  been vegan for years and it's the best thing i've ever done bite size vegan is an amazing channel to look at!,1,NOT
" being vego will make you gain i gained over 0kg when vego then went vegan and lost like 0kg.. struggle to keep it on tbh. stay away from the dairy! its pure fat baby cow growth formula fruit veg carbs like potatoes pasta rice and like maybe a couple of awesome vegan donuts per week or day and you will lose weight. your body may need more than weeks to adjust though so please don't be discouraged if its not immediate its a lifestyle not a diet keep that in mind if you're only doing it to look good its called plant based"". took me a couple month to fully adjust so please be patient and don't expect results a in a couple weeks or b if you are still having chicken eggs or any milk products ooorrr c if you're not in it for the right reasons bc it won't last and therefore it won't work) oh also if you eat unripe bananas you'll be constipated also the food you showed is like literally one meal! more potatoes!  good luck trish. please listen to the advice and don't expect results if you don't do it right yeah?!",1,NOT
omg so happy for you trisha give your body time and it'll change for sure i lost  pounds in a calendar year i feel great the first month is the hardest so try to keep motivated by watching videos and educate yourself whatever you ate as a meat eater just make the vegan alternative good luck trisha Ô∏è,1,NOT

i've been vegan for years and raw vegan for a month and i love it fruit and vegetables are great and entirely sustainable but you'll crash if you don't eat enough of them i eat minimum of 00 calories worth of them on raw i find that raw vegan is the best way to maintain a slim figure i did gain weight on a regular vegan diet i love raw vegan protein shakes they come in tons of good flavors and are wonderful in smoothies for regular vegan veggie sushi is amazing basically anything thai or indian is super yummy too just make sure that it is vegan you'll be surprised how many things are vegan when going out personally i loved chipoltle's sofritas congratulations on trying this lifestyle.,1,NOT

hey trish! some of my fave vegan foods are vegan brownies you can either get the recipe on google or you can buy them in stores sometimes bean curd/tofu try the marinated tofu or you can get awesome chinese meals with bean curd often sweet chilli/sweet and sour sauce try spicy bean burgers too they're filling and imo taste better than some fake meat options i also love vegan bacon but i've been veggie for a long time so it might take a while for you to adjust to overall try meals filled with rice cous cous or quinoa they keep you full and incorporate lots of flavours into your diet like soy chilli etc) i'm definitely not an expert but i've been veggie my whole life so hopefully you might find one of these ideas interesting love you mama trish   ps sorry for all the parenthesis in this comment lmao),1,NOT

well for protein fruits actually contain protein but not as much as you need so i suggest beans beans give one of the best proteins everrrr and i'm just so glad that at least you learned how abusive humans are towards animals and its just so sad that we kill animals in their own home.,1,NOT
i went to a place called the gentle barn in santa clarita i fed horses chickens hugged cows afterwards we went out to eat and i couldn't bring myself to eat meat that was over a year ago and i have found so many yummy things to eat by doing a lot of research online it's helped my waistline and my life in general give it a chance and i wish you lots of luck!,1,NOT
this bitch going vegan and has probably about  real-leather handbags.. .-,5,ABU
i would reccomend you to not only eat fruits ang veggies eat pasta rice potatos etc too) also if you do eat any animal products by accident don't beat yourself up or give up it's so important because if you beat yourself up about it you are likely to just give up and also eat when you're hungy your body is telling you that you need food so give your body food i love you so much trisha and i love that you are doing this hope it sticks with you best of luck,1,NOT
i'm so proud of you trish stick to it,1,NOT

"freelee can eat a ton of calories because she excersizes like crazy and she's superrrr fit the key to the raw till diet that she promotes is eating a ton of carbs in the form of fruit veg rice and potatoes and excersizing hardcore for an hour a day and being active if you want to loose weight on a vegan diet and not excursive that much you need to lower your caloric intake because your body won't be burning all of those calories off there's no doubt about it though that whole foods especially when they're in their raw form are the best for your body and you will be the healthiest off nutritionally if you're just eating vegan not specifically raw till or excersizing frequently i would suggest to eating so that the bulk of your diet comes from fruit and veggies cooked or uncooked with some brown rice potatoes accompanying it and once in a while adding in some beans and rarely some nuts/seeds you don't have to worry about protein deficiency because it literally doesn't exist since everything you eat has protein in it don't cook with any oil and try not to add salt to any food you're eating that's to loose weight if you're going to fall off the wagon and are thinking about stopping being vegan it's good to educate yourself more on the ethical reasons why a vegan diet is so good watching forks over knives gary yourofksy's speech on youtube called the best speech you will ever hear"" earthlings and other things will help also as well if you're feeling like you're going to fall off the wagon because you really want to eat your favourite ___ try looking for a vegan version of that in the grocery store lots of times the vegan version of things are really tasty and helps the transition or have some pasta or bread non-whole foods carb options) these things are not recommended for loosing weight though that's more for the rare treat or once you've reached your goal weight to loose weight cut out the alcohol up your water intake to about -4l a day a big l or l water bottle really helps with this and drink l of that water with lemon each morning before you eat breakfast maybe drink it while you go for a walk first thing after you wake up and then come back to eat) and make sure you're getting adequate sleep and try to avoid stress hope this helps )",1,NOT
awesome trisha well done! so glad to see you going down this path after so much back and forth with freelee over the years the best thing i did when i wen vegan was to look up recipes they don't have to be fancy there are so many out there and it will make it waaaaay easier than trying to figure out on your own what the hell to do with all those veggies you're going down an incredible path and when yo find that love and connection with animals and knowing you're doing right by them by going vegan just fills you with so much positivity and passion best thing i have ever ever done!,1,NOT

for those who don't know the only reason trish did this video is because freelee the banana girl paid and pleaded with her to do it you can look at trishs snapchat and see she is not eating a vegan diet freelee is having a severe credibility issue at the moment she has stolen content from small youtubers made false copyright claims on channels to silence them and also recently endorsed eating meat despite claiming to be a vegan she was also recently kicked off instagram for bullying other users all this is online and verifiable please don't fall for freelee's nonsense i don't blame trish cash is cash everyone has got to eat.,3,NOT

best thing ever get bananas that are very ripe the more brown the sweeter and cut them up and put them in a baggy in the freezer cut up lots then in the morning put frozen bananas and cocoa powder healthy and blend it so it's kind of slushy then put it in a bowl then in the same blender mix frozen strawberries and cocoa powder i use what is already left from bananas and mix to the same consistency then add to the bowl of bananas and on top add any fruit you want it's legit the best and do filling!!,1,NOT

she just snap chat chicken lol so yea,3,NOT
i highly suggest going vegan for at least a month because for the first couple weeks your body goes through a detox because it's not used to the amount of fiber and if you ever feel like giving in to the standard american diet just remind yourself what made you go vegan i recommend to just keep looking into the horrors of animal agriculture and how it affects not only the animals but our planet because that is such a big issue and if you keep that in mind the benefits or the mind and body just come along with it.,2,NOT
i love to skin potatoes and bake them and also rice with tofu and veggies is soo amazing!! and also lettuce black beans and salsa is frickin bomb glad to see you're vegan i am going vegan because i'm vegetarian right now! i love you trish so much you're awesome and beautiful i hope you stay vegan you are sooo inspiring!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,1,NOT

first off all when you see people being vegan raw raw to four vegetarian and fruitarian and their not over weight fat chubby or obese of course they will look good because they where original skinny and didn't have to lose so much weight they will look good and will promote that their lives are the best way to live where bigger people if they do theses diets or go on theses lives styles they will end up with excess skin just like every other diet.,3,NOT
i'm so happy for you! i am a vegan also and i just wanna give you some tips so you don't make the same mistakes i did i went vegan after watching freelee and at first i lost a ton of weight cause i still ate a normal ratio of macronutrients carbs protein fat and ate a reasonable amount for my body weight once i started taking freelees advise i developed binge eating disorder no of course that is not completly freelees fault but her emphasis on smashing in the carbs led me to trying to eat as much as her then i eventually got used to it i ended up gaining even more than i lost originally my triglycerides in my blood test were too high and i was struggling with digestive issues and energy level issues i am still struggling with binge eating to this day two years later but try as hard as i can to actually eat only when i'm hungry not out of boredom and stop when i feel good and satisfied rather than overstuffed and feeling like i'm gonna explode.,2,NOT
that's awesome!! great for you i guess you could make a mukbang eat veggie grill ,1,NOT

make sure you're not just eating fruit and veg in a day you need protein and carbs like pastas and rice wholegrain if you want to be healthier) otherwise your body will cling on to the natural sugars in the fruit and you won't loose any weight nuts and lentils are also important also those vegan donuts original chips are good ideas for salt and sugar in limited amounts still need those to be healthy just don't eat too much of them good luck!!!,1,NOT
she eats chicken tenders all the timeüòë,3,NOT
my eyes she is to ugly kg make up aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,6,ABU
not hating but she posted sour cream and onion chips on her story and those have milk...,2,NOT
ahhh trishy this is so exciting okay my favorite go-to is beans rice beans have a good amount of protein and the rice helps keep you full pasta is also really good and since you apparently like carrots based off this video you could do some thinly sliced carrots in the pasta and it would be so good and if you like avocados they have some protein too they also have some fats that are good for your body and they can be spread on toast and have a relatively similar texture to butter protein shakes are another good option and i frequently have those for breakfast and if any of your bananas get really soft and overripe peel them cut them up and put them in the freezer so you can blend them up to make banana ice cream as a sweet treat good luck with these weeks and i'm sure they'll open your eyes to everything you can still eat as a vegan i promise you won't be missing out on anything it's such an awesome lifestyle!!<3,1,NOT

finally huntyyyyy!!!! okay okay so i'm gonna start off by saying you probably gained weight on a vegetarian diet because of the dairy which is arguably worse then meat! okay so some snacks you could do are potatoes literally potatoes are your best friend my favorite is japanese sweet potatoes because yes another thing is if you want to make something that requires eggs use flax seed eggs as a vegan alternative which you can get a target  as far as milk i prefer sweetened almond milk over soy milk,1,NOT
girl get you some rice quinoa potatoes legumes corn pasta!!! get them carbssssa,1,NOT
as far as frappuccinos go i mean they're not healthy but if you want one every once in a while there are vegan options the actual base of all fraps is dairy free whether you're getting a coffee base or cream base or you can swap out the regular base for soy milk if you want you just have to focus on the flavour portion and skip anything with dairy example nothing chocolate and no caramal drizzle and obviously no whipped cream if you get the light version of any frap it automatically contains dairy so frappuccinos you can still get coffee mocha oprah chai espresso green tea strawberries and cr√®me.,1,NOT

hi trisha i'm vegan and it seems everyone's recommending you the not so appetizing things to a meat eater like nuts legumes beans! which are totally great but if you're someone who likes more meaty and fattier things there's so many amazing brands that especially where you live you can get substitutes at your regular grocery store some great ones for meat are gardiene eves and if you love ice cream some are coconut bliss so nice etc you can eat most potato chips and the best vegan cheese is daiya i like the blocks the most) there's lots of butter replacements you can eat tons of dark chocolate etc etc(:,1,NOT
hey trish i'm so glad to see you are going vegan i originally did it for a few weeks at first and took me about a year to transition i've been vegan for two years and i love it i've lost fifteen pounds and still have my curves my advice to you would be stick to whole foods follow mr and mrs vegan's wslf guide maybe even reach out to them for a potential collab check them out on instagram youtube and tumblr good luck on your vegan challenge!,1,NOT

i'm so happy you are trying this lifestyle out!!,1,NOT
trish you should watch unnatural vegan's videos here on youtube she's got lots of stuff about proper vegan nutrition so you don't quit after a week eat lots of legumes leafy greens nuts seeds fruits and veggies and you'll be fine after sometime you wll need to star using suplements like vitamin b12 but you've got time time to learn more about it again go to unnatural vegan's channel.,1,NOT
finally this day has come!! trisha you are my inspiration in life and i am so happy that you are trying the vegan lifestyle!! you are going to love it!! your body is so bombastic already but you are going to look like an angel! at first it is hard but you will get through it!! for me it was giving up ice cream but ben jerry's dairy free peanut butter and cookies ice cream hits the spot!! and all of gardein chicken tenders are sooooooooo good too!!! eat all you can and always know the fishie's are always here for you and i love you lots!! i wish you amazing luck! ps never starve yourself eat lots of grapes instead!!,1,NOT
here are my tips for you 1)the most important tip is to eat until you get full do not try and eat as much as freelee you will feel sick 2 keep it simple don't try to follow in sort of guidelines what i mean by this is do not eat a bunch of raw foods because it's not pm yet if following raw till  trust me you will end up over eating because you didn't have what you are craving 3)just about everything can be made vegan if you get a craving have a little bit for example i crave pizza chocolate waffles etc. what i do is look up vegan recipes where to find those vegan teams and eat them if i crave chocolate i buy the bar and i eat a square or two and then tuck it away for a rainy day 4 while any exercise is good exercise i recommend you do a little more than normal ex taking a morning walk/jog as well as dancing 5 educate yourself it well help you build a deeper connection that way you stay on track if you get off track get back on you're gonna do great!,1,NOT
also a quick tip for eating so much fruit you should add a protein in otherwise your body turns it to sugar so like banana and apple you should put it with peanut butter which is also a good filler,1,NOT
burrito bowls are amazing lots of rice beans lettuce corn ect ,1,NOT
"gosh i hope she will not listen to people who says carb the fuck up and eat 00 calories a day no!!! don't do that just eat whole foods plant based food like brown rice,potatoes,beannns,veggies protein),avocado,nuts,fruits and greens lots of greens!",2,NOT
oh a vegan b1 supplement i recommend that actually tastes decent is from natural health goodies you can buy them on amazon) highly recommend so you don't crash they are small chewable and aren't nasty if you are like me and are worried about getting enough vitamins and minerals we aren't all perfect vegans!) deva makes a good multivitamin that is quite tiny and easy to swallow again you can get them on amazon) don't forget to drink tons of water d,1,NOT
fuck veganism!! saturated fat is healthy it doesn't clog arteries saturated fat is important for the brain and it keeps cell structures strong saturated fatty acids are also needed for important signaling and stabilization processes in the body saturated fat is required for calcium to be effectively incorporated into bone saturated fats found in butter and coconut oil myristic acid and lauric acid play key roles in immune health excess refined sugar vegetable oils and smoking are what damages arteries the body uses cholesterol to heal the damaged arteries since cholesterol is important for tissue repair.,5,ABU

freelee's body is the result of over  years vegan and riding a bike 0km every single day it took her years to get that body you may actually end up gaining weight over the next weeks because of metabolic damage rather than loose weight so just be wary of that i hope you stay vegan after the weeks because you will notice that you will feel better and have more energy and of course you will be supporting the lives of animals but in saying that you might not loose any weight.....,2,NOT
get beans lentils rice i suggest a lot of starches so you can get the satisfied feeling that you are use to then start eating more lighter foods as you become more active and ect read up on the starch solution and always be low fat and don't use any oil in your cooking for the best health results you may not loss a lot of weight right away because your digestive system will be cleansing and getting use to higher volumes of food,1,NOT

who else loves trisha??‚ù§ i am a new youtuber and i would love to be successful on youtube just like trish one day so make sure to hit that subscribe buttonüòçüòçüòçüòç,1,NOT
check out raw vegan not gross on youtube her chili recipe is freaking delicious ,1,NOT
you need way more than just fruit i tried that too but you have to have more than that to be healthy you need greens grains rice and starch you also need to eat beans for a snack eat seeds and nuts.,2,NOT
honestly weeks on a vegan diet isn't going to do much in terms of weight also you'll want to lay off the oily foods.,2,NOT
make sure you get enough pretend,3,NOT
yay trisha i'm so glad you're going vegan the grapes are good but if you want a significant source of nutrients from them then you probably have to eat like one bag per day so i recommend not making the grapes into a meal but just having a few cups every day as a snack the bananas are good as well very good just make sure you eat them when they ripen because the bananas you showed in the video weren't ripe and that amount was good for like one or two days if you really want to go seriously then those will not be enough for one day technically you are supposed to eat at least  bananas a day so take that into mind also freely eats like two or three of those bunches for breakfast the carrots are a good source of vitamin a but you should use those more in cooking than eating them raw just because it's better to get all of your carbs in in the morning and then your vegetables are better later in the evening steaming the carrots corn green beans and other vegetables you like and pairing them with brown rice tastes very good watermelons are a good source of vitamin a c and will hydrate you but again the watermelon is better off as a snack and not a meal same with the cantaloupe most of the food you picked out is good for snacking and not really for meals you are going to want to pick up some dates mangoes potatoes brown rice almond milk or any other dairy substitute) pasta is good chickpeas and lentils it is definitely recommended you eat raw in the morning and most of the afternoon and then cooked food in the evening if you think eating raw is too hard then just throw it all the fruit you want in a blender add a shit ton of water some almond milk if you want and some coconut sugar if you want also look up vegan recipes you can have for dinner and maybe even some desserts if you want don't worry about overeating as long as you are eating fruits and vegetables because you can have as much as you want without gaining weight of course after eating you will be bloated but it will mostly be water and after urinating your belly will go down it's also good if you buy vegan multivitamins meant for vegans because if you are not very educated in nutrition you could end up with deficiencies i recommend the deva one-a-day multivitamin mineral i am glad you are taking this step and remember to eat if you are hungry and don't worry about calory intake you will not gain weight as long as you are eating right and remember always to carb the fuck up!,1,NOT
you should eat fish,2,NOT
hey trish it's so easy to eat vegan i know you're doing it for health reasons and that's a great start stick to whole foods the best u can and cut out or limit processed foods if u want to lose weight also you don't have to necessarily be an animal lover to be against animal cruelty so the fact that you have cut down your meat consumption is awesome and there are so many dairy alternatives that you're basically giving up nothing you're just eating the plant based and healthier version good luck and keep doing research on why going vegan is the best thing for your body the animals and our planet!,1,NOT
why is trisha taking up freele out of nowhere? smells like a big pile of ,5,ABU
being vegan was the best thing for me you can still eat a normal diet but substitute animal products: it can be easy to eat veggie burgers and tofu but processed foods still aren't the best i eat a lot of rice and beans that's very filling i put beans into my salad for protein i love to eat pasta and jarred tomatoes for dinner and just fruit throughout the day for snacking good luck:))))))),1,NOT
well you inspired me to try this diet but we will see after all this cheese pizza cola digest then i will talk when you're not hungry you'll give up any food lol,1,NOT

broccoli almond milk sweet patatos and lentils will all definitely give you that protein and what you need:),1,NOT
i think the best advice i could give is to get rid of all the meat dairy and eggs that are in your kitchen and fill your fridge and cupboards with plenty of vegan friendly options don't be afraid of carbs whole plant carbs like potatoes rice and oats will be your best friend as well as pasta if you eat pasta with some low fat tomato pasta sauce with some vegetables and potatoes it's a really awesome and filling lunch or dinner do make sure you're eating enough get the fruit the starches and the veg in and eat as much as you want good luck with your vegan journey trish i'm very proud of you for stepping up and giving it a try xx,1,NOT

stress makes me break out like crazy i went vegetarian minus the main dairy product like milk cheese eggs etc and i still breakout when i stress out before exams don't rely on veganism to cure all of your problems and don't expect to see results straight away you're not going to see results in weeks i would say after two months of me being veggie by body actually got use to it and i went from  stone to and a half i actually gained a lot of weight in the first month due to the changes in my diet by body wasn't use to.,2,NOT

you can still drink frappicinos just ask them to replace the milk with soy milk or coconut milk to me it still tastes the same n.n i'm so happy you are going vegan remember to eat enough carbs though  theres a bunch of options at whole foods.,1,NOT
there's still plenty of foods that you probably eat daily that you won't have to give up and any time you'd normally eat meat just replace it with a meat replacement like quorn - lots of crisps are still okay to eat and lots of biscuits are vegan too oreos are vegan!! there's also a ton of yummy dairy free/vegan snacks in shops now in my local store there's a whole dairy free section vegan brownies are amazing especially after being warmed up in the microwave! health stores normally have loads of vegan options too also subscribe to nature box or graze box you have the option to only let them send you vegan snacks and their stuff is delicious maybe you can get them to sponsor you too haha! good luck trish it seems daunting at first but it's really not as difficult as you'd expect it to be if you can find the right foods it really doesn't have to be just veggies rice!!,1,NOT
awww i'm so excited for you! you're gonna love it good luck if you need any help there is a huge loving vegan community for you ),1,NOT
you can still be fat and vegan if you eat garbage just sayin' if you can't eat healthy on meat you won't eat healthy on vegan lifestyle either.,5,ABU
i've been a vegan for about years now and i'm just gonna tell you it takes a lot of fucking patience the first month is gonna be like hell you have no idea what to eat and you're gonna feel like shot sometimes but after that it's pretty damn awesome i've lost like 0kg and i can gain and lose weight pretty easily if i eat the right stuff unfortunately i love fried shit) my tips are that you should start with being a vegetarian and eating less meat if you cut out all meat and shit like that at once you're just gonna binge on it later what me and a lot of my friends did) then you should eat grains and beans so you get stuffed and get used to the calories oh and don't forget the bananas you better eat a lot of them the biggest mistake i probably made was threat i didn't really explore so much i basically ate the same things everyday and got bored so try out new things as often as you can it helped me lose the weight a lot faster too i have no idea why love you!,1,NOT
omg i never expected this you go girl! you'll feel great but don't try to go fully raw the first few days because you'll feel restricted and you'll just crash good luck!!:)))),1,NOT
try imitation meat! you can season it however you want and it is so good for people who are trying to cut out meat i've been vegan for about five months and balancing meals have been that hardest part carb up every morning! eat bigger portions of carbs so that you don't get weak from hunger.,1,NOT
you just need to eat a lot of greens like broccoli salads cucumbers celery etc to get your digestive system going that way itll clean your digestive tract drink a lot  gallons of water and only water for your tummy to go down for the next weeks and just cook healthy from home with goods carbs and keep the carbs low and keep your sodium intake low atleast a week before the shoot that way you dont hold water weight and get all bloated eat 200-150 calories a day just for the next two weeks and count them you can use myfitnesspal app make sure you get your protein in because it burns calories and just hop on that treadmill for 0  mins a everyday and your pounds will disappear good luck,1,NOT
wheat thins are vegan,1,NOT
if you want protein go for beans soy satan chickpea falafel amazing with hummus and fake meat if you want good luck:),1,NOT
i really hope you can do it this time please remember it's a lifestyle even if just for weeks it includes no leather no animal products at all regardless of if its edible or not when you are vegan you need carbs you need to eat plentifully eating small amounts puts your body into fat storing mode never be hungry but eat the right things embrace the carbs avoid the fat and sodium if possible vegan isn't a diet it's a lifestyle and you won't loose weight in weeks if done properly first your body goes through detox from all the animal products then you may put on some weight as your body ajusts to eating well in time you will loose weight you loose weight slowly but it stays off unlike a fat diet in weeks though your skin will glow and you will feel so good you won't care too much about weight anymore well done i'm proud of you soak up advice and welcome to a healthier happier you Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,1,NOT

i've been a vegetarian for a month and a half and these are the foods i like to eat lentils mixed with rice and fried onions have a lot of protein so try that try making a vegan chilli tofu is amazing too at the grocery store try to look for organic meatless hamburgers chicken etc i really hope your diet works out so proudüòò,1,NOT
i have never clicked a video faster i've been vegan for around months and it makes me feel and look so much healthier be sure to buy very dense fruits such as mangoes and dates  water-based fruits have less calories and will leave you feeling pretty hungry throughout the day another thing you can make are vegan burritos with beans rice avocados and you can add beefless crumbles if you'd like i 10 recommend gardein meat substitutes if you begin craving meat  their chicken tenders beefless burgers and pork sliders are so delicious remember to carb the f** up potatoes rice and healthy breads and pastas are your best friend make sure to check the breads and pastas for eggs and milk) they do not make you gain weight but provide glucose to your brain and keep you from being hungry throughout the day you should do a vegan taco bell mukbang! everything there could be made vegan i love the layer burrito with no cheese no sour cream and add potatoes and pico! xx,1,NOT

it takes a little while before you start seeing visible results so be patient trish!,1,NOT
veganism is good for numerous reasons but you cannot expect a body transformation in weeks your body might retain some of the food you are eating since you've been starving yourself naturally more water weight because the fruits foods you will be eating naturally have more liquid you will definitely probably see results in your skin recommend foods potatoes they will keep you full for a long time don't have any fat instead of frying bake them put spices on it find a low fat sauce you can dip them in if you'd like frozen smoothies in the morning just buy those frozen mix of fruits you see at the supermarket blend with a bit of water or almond milk maybe some vanilla i wish you the very best on your vegan journey üíó,1,NOT

yay i am so proud of you this is fantastic newsi it may be difficult at first but you are stronger than you think honey i believe in you you just have to retrain your brain and way of thinking every time you put your fork to your mouth i highly recommend you subscribe to the vegan mojo he offers alot of amazing helpful tips that will help you transition over to veganism you don't have to just eat fruits or lettuce he makes food that you would normally buy at a fast food joint but made completely from vegan ingredients you don't have to give up your love for chicken tenders burgers pizza tacos whatever you love to eat there is a vegan option out there just do your research but i wouldn't recommend following what freelee preaches honestly her diet is only sustainable if you are an athlete who exercise alot you will give up if going vegan if you stick to just what she eats you want to take baby steps and ease your way into this lifestyle because you do want to be in it for life if you aren't eating the things you love and enjoy you're going to want to give up i know you want to do this for aesthetics but the bigger picture is to do it for the animals you know how those videos made you feel well it is the cruel reality of what happens every single day in the meat and dairy industry again.. yea meat tastes f*cking awesome so for someone who has been eating it their entire life would find a vegan lifestyle impossible to stick with because they think they can only eat fruit and salads etc.. but it is not true at all just do your best and don't beat yourself up if you fail just start again fresh the next day baby steps ease your way into this lifestyle...because once you see how amazing your body is going to feel you will be hooked don't forget to drink plenty of water too best of luck sweetie i am rooting for you d,1,NOT

first of all congratulations your body won't magically transform in two weeks but you'll feel so much better and you'll see differences in your skin and overall health before i went vegan i struggled with multiple eating disorders i still struggle but the vegan lifestyle lets you eat in abundance.. which your body wants because the food you eat is your energy stay carbed up of course but also drink plenty of water at first i started to replace animal products with vegan products such as almond milk go veggie cheese earth balance vegan butter bagels daiya cream cheese boca burgers boca chicken patties gardien orange chickn oatmeal with maple syrup peanut butter and vegan cereals humans are addicted to dairy and cheese so replacing them with a vegan option helps curve the cravings although all the food i mentioned is vegan junk food i just wanted to let you know that there is literally a vegan option for anything and that you're not missing out xo good luck!,1,NOT

i've been vegan for a couple months now and you'll love it your body is going to feel amazing and while you're doing it for the two weeks keep educating yourself on the health animal and environment aspects of it because you''ll never want to go back it's so easy to stay vegan because there are alternatives and recipes for everything like right now i have vegan brownies in the oven right now i would say you're plant based because veganism is really about your whole lifestyle but your on the right track and its not something i did overnight i eased into first vegetarian then plantbased then no more leather fur etc and cruelty free products..i have a vegan beauty channel inspired by my fave vegan freelee where the only products i promote and cruelty free good luck with this trish and i hope you stay vegan forever  and get shane to do this with you!!,1,NOT

when i went vegan i went into it fully unprepared d i don't know how i survived and that was years ago when vegan food wasn't as available as it is today i'm from europe i'd suggest you to buy a lot of staples don't try to go 00 pure/clean and healthy because you will feel like a failure if you slip up i know i do so i buy myself a lot of healthy staples unprocessed food. but now and then i buy some prepared vegan spreads bread veggie burgers etc so pasta in all forms whole wheat white from different cereals beans lentils canned) mixed frozen veggies buckwheat mushrooms and a looot of fruit dry fruit is good too when you have cravings for something dates popcorn if you have a machine you can air pop it) potatoes sweet potatoes brown rice basmati rice white rice black rice wild rice red rice oats some type of plant milk try them out) mixed nuts seeds to sprinkle on your salad soo lettuce of some kind it's nice to eat salad once in a while) while i don't suggest eating oil. it's good to have it in the beginning cold pressed coconut oil is perfection when combining with tomato sauce d virgin olive oil isn't bas as well but i wouldn't recommend heating it if you have a farmer's market buy fruit in bulk because if you don't have ripe fruit around you won't desire eating it whenever you feel like eating something just google vegan _____ and i think there exist a vegan version of anything oh and the best and healthiest icecream out there is banana ice cream or nicecream  the best thing ever that is a must if you feel lost then try a vegan online challenge you have a lot of pages that you can sign up to and they send you tips on how to start where to start what to eat where to buy etc good luck,1,NOT

for me personally i love starches more than sweets many vegans thrive on a fruity diet but for myself personally i enjoyed reading the starch solution by doctor mcdougall it resonates with me more just try multiple things as long as you are eating mostly whole foods you will feel better and be healthier make sure you are eating enough!! many people arent used to eating so much but vegan whole foods aren't very calorie dense so you need to eat more and throughout the day eat lots of veggies and fruits potatoes are your friends  most vegans tend to eat high carb low fat good luck and persevere!,1,NOT
yes trish i went vegan almost months ago and it was definitely one of the best choices i have made,1,NOT

black bean burgers are always great for the summer and got protein eat lots of leafy greens for iron make sure to take a b1 supplement if you go fully vegan because you woulf most likely need it animals are made to eat b1 it comes from the ground so when they are slaughtered its in the meat almond milk or soy milk are the best.,1,NOT

regarding the lgbt community as a whole not every individual this is all part of the homosexual agenda you can be sure if not curbed it will weaken our entire nation i'm not at all hesitant to say i don't like them i don't and it's their fault for overstepping their boundaries more precisely for their insatiable lust for children i might seem to be off-base until you explore an alternate perspective they have developed an obsession with presumed authority first they presumed to tell straight people that because we don't understand them and because we are uncomfortable with their relentless effort to integrate some form of conveying the hey look at me i'm gay. message into everything they do we are mentally distressed and need counseling then they advanced to corrupting every television program with some form of homosexuality for example i turned on family guy one day the last show i watched regularly and suddenly stewie was gay to me in a modern family the grandparents are baby-boomers and parents have tattoos and a mind that is not stuck in a 930s time warp a boy with dads and no mom is my idea of a throwed-off family television stations do not have show directors to choose the shows they broadcast they have programming directors who choose the content with which they will program the audience children are a large part of the television audience the entertainment industry has no shortage of homosexuals there are even radio stations and probably television channels that broadcast only content from homosexual performers but if we try something like that they cry because we have violated their right to double-standards now their lust for children they have demanded the children of the nation which they cannot produce be taught there are more than genders not only that but they want to tell the other people's children they can choose their gender leaving a child at home alone is dangerous but it pales in comparison to teaching a child lies in school where they go to learn the truth but let's go on and tell the kids the many genders homosexuals have created in their minds are 00 as real as the that can be scientifically proven give the boys female hormones give the girls male steroids there's no reason a  year old girl shouldn't be taught how to put a condom on a life-like latex penis right that's how the state of california sees it are you starting to see their lust for children yet? do your best to convince yourself that will benefit the child as much as the sexually perverted pedophile give them all puberty blocking chemicals to allow them extra time to decide what they are honey if you identify as a toaster that's just fine daddy and daddy will still love you just as much as if you were a pixie or a fairy i believe in equal rights however when the population of an entire state is forced to accept the fantasies of the mentally ill as reality and abide by laws that mandate promoting the lgbt agenda by teaching children these people's delusions are reality while ignoring the majority of the population who actually produce the children that is far from equal and . rights what rights who gave them the right to lie to our children oh wait silly me it was obviously their fairy godmother so the result is that a champion female athlete is not only robbed of her status but robbed of her chance to earn a scholarship and maybe a better education than she can get without it because she has to compete against boys who want to dress like girls some girls might rely on a scholarship to go to college there have already been cases where girls in contact sports have been injured by boys dressing up as girls what's next you can be sure the girls are not the only victims though they're just the first to take a hard blow those boys are in the spotlight now but according to statistics dark times are just a blink away and all for what it is nothing but lust for new meat that motivates the lgb.. whatever they are this week to recruit children it gets even worse there is a new movement of people seeking to become part of the lgb... crowd they have labelled themselves maps are you ready for this minor-attracted persons that's the long way to go about saying pedophile. they believe it should be legal to . as long as they have the child's permission there was a time it was different but today the propaganda outright lies) the self-promoting content in every form of media and the aggressive recruiting campaign of the homosexual community has saturated every aspect of the nations children's lives thereby bringing them down to the same disgusting level as pedophiles they don't care if these kids will become so confused and frustrated that they'll rent a gun and buy a bullet before they reach 0 no i don't dislike them for their sexual preference i despise them for the negative impact the children will feel due to their selfishness lack of respect for the nation's youth and for their presumptuous attitude and actions.,7,ABU

i heard you failed but to let you know you can eat beans rice pasta burritos vegan cupcakes pancakes veggie burgers vegan cheese so good except daiya i don't like it personally but you might literally for every meat there is a vegan substitute for it however don't eat mock meats like tofu everyday because it is somewhat processed and it's better to steer clear every now and then quinoa and beans have protein and fiber theirs lentils and so much more,1,NOT
my favourite thing about this video is how trish was calling freelee beautiful and complimenting her out of all the controversial videos freelee has made the worst meanest ones have been about trish and yet trish will still say such kind things about her,1,NOT
yayyyy!!! do not calorie restrict eat until you are 00 satisfied you will not gain weight!!!! also if you still want frappuccinos get them with coconut milk:),1,NOT
highly recommend getting some transitional vegan options like gardein vegan chicken veggie burgers thinks like that you can also get vegan cheeses and great vegan milk alternatives i know you like eggs for breakfast so you can even try this new thing that you can get at whole foods called vegan egg or make a egg scramble but with tofu instead of eggs of course keep in a lot of fruit and try different ways to have veggies but don't forget rice and good carbs.,1,NOT
"make sure to eat your carbs and healthy fats but mostly carbs try and eat ,500 calories and get that body moving you can do this!!!!",1,NOT
come on guys be nice to trisha she is trying also it would be amazing to have someone with as many views and subs as her in the vegan community.,1,NOT
trish yaaaaaas omg im vegan and i will help you!! we will give u all the encouragement you need! first things first make sure you are getting in your calories natural vegan foods are naturally low in calories so you get to eat more i can't stress it enough to eat enough because a lot of ppl tend to get weak from going vegan and blame it on not enough meat when really its because they aren't getting enough calories so eat lol if you are eating whole plant foods u don't need to count calories just eat when ur hungry and stop when full you can easily get your protein through beans oats lentils even fruit has some protein so don't even worry about it plus we actually don't even need that much protein there's also tons of vegan products vegan meats vegan cheeses vegan ice creams find the ones you like i already know you like vanilla almond milk  hit us up trish if you need more help! the only supplement i suggest u take is a small b1 pill that's it ur skin may even clear up too trish ur gonna love it.,1,NOT
you should buy a lot of pasta potatoes and other good carbs d there are a lot of vegan meat substitutes that are really good like burgers and tofu and a lot of other stuff )theres basically vegan options for like everything d,1,NOT
for even smoothies or acai bowls,1,NOT
trisha...i love your videos....but slow down for the love of pete sometimes i can't understand what you're saying!!!! lol...but what helps a ton is watching what i eat in a day for vegans there's so much more than fruit to eat in your diet best of luck and record it please we would love to watch!,1,NOT
the freelee is collab shit is wrong since she was talking bout u on a video,2,NOT
yass trish! this is awesome,1,NOT
::pls read this lol it may be helpful: make sure you take vitamin b1 and get all the nutrients you need and you're probably gonna get cravings most people do at the beginning of their journey:) especially knowing you hehe so i recommend getting fake meat products such as gardein products they're soooo yummy and make your cravings dissapear:) eat lots of beans and spinach and get yummy coconut milk ice cream or sorbet stuff it's my favourite fucken thing and ugh just yummmmm!!!! and also it's not an easy change it's huge and takes commitment but if you stick with it you wonttttt regret it!! don't be afraid to eat a chicken nugget every once in a blue moon if that's what you're really craving cutting yourself off completely at all times especially when you first start out may just make you resent the vegan diet even more!(for some people it's better to just go cold turkey(or tofurkey in this case)and that's cool too:) you're still making a huge difference with this choice and i'm so happyyyy:)))),1,NOT

oh and in order to lose weight on a vegan diet you can pretty much eat everything you want as long as it's a low fat whole food such as fruits vegetables whole grains and beans eating lots of processed foods oils or high fat plant foods like avocado olives coconuts nuts and seeds will likely make you gain weight but in moderation those are fine.,1,NOT

the only tip i can give you is that in regards to gaining weight is lower the intake in sugar also not all sugars a vegan but regardless sugar is s big issues for new vegans who want to lose weight they think because it had not animal products which isn't always true it's healthy but sugar is a weight gainer for sure you can have sugar but try to stay away from vegan desserts it's filled with sugar for the most part to make it taste good,1,NOT

your body will likely not transform in two weeks but eating mostly fruit and veggies will do wonders for your skin and digestion that said somebody else in the comments said not to eat only raw fruit and veg to start and i'd agree cause it will probably be too abrupt a change to stick to if you seriously want to try out the diet and help your health and aesthetics long term i'd start by going to vegan restaurants and trying well prepared vegan meals even the ones with fake meats cheese etc if you're adventurous and eating fruit and veg at home also it would be a good idea to allow yourself some vegan sweets as a transition i'm not a vegan activist and i'm not writing this to you because of your reach i've been dealing with disordered eating on and off for the last  years and since i went vegan some months ago so much in my body and mind has changed for the better yes i've lost a bit of fat too) and i hope it does for you too good luck.,1,NOT

hey trish a vegan here ! first off if you want to succeed you absolutely shouldn't even consider not eating as much as you want!! the only way you are going to gain weight on a vegan diet us if you eat oily fatty foods so if you want to lose weight as quickly as possible eliminate all overt fats(avocado nuts seeds coconuts etc that most of their calories come from fat also eat as much while foods as possible like ricepotatoes beans lentils oats and such those are going yo make you satiated and full for a looong time that packaged watermelon shouldn't even be a snack and it is not good a idea to eat it at lunch time bc melons have a high water content so they are best digested if eaten first thing in the morning otherwise you are going to be bloated and gassyüôÑ for example you can eat fruit as breakfast for lunch you can make potato fries that you bake in the oven instead of dunking them in oilüòù you can make rice stir fry with loots of veggies and rice again no oil.. there are endless recepies search around youtube also watch mr&mrs vegan on youtube they are from la and have helped me a looot to understand how to eat properly and have very educational videos hope you continue this after the weeks aaand good luck ,1,NOT
this is such horseshit clearly her glam and outfit tell this video is old and she's constantly posting vlogs about eating non vegan things and in her cook with me grocery haul on her vlog channel she references piggies sizzling and she's cooking bacon and apologizes to all the vegans and says she tried to go vegan for a hot minute this video is clearly the hot minute) it's fucking pathetic she would even upload this knowing she didn't stick with it.,5,ABU

don't eat light weight things like fruit and expect to fill up u gotta eat potatoes beans rice pasta grains this seems so lame and gross but u can make it taste so good like you said how those brussel sprouts were good veggies are good when grilled esp green peppers let your body adjust to the new diet you may gain some weight at first just because you're taking in more calories but veganism will clean out your body and eventually you'll be down to your body's best weight it takes awhile if you're willing to try veganism or even vegetaraianism without dairy you will end up with clear skin and less weight but for most diets to be effective you have to exercise that's why freelee is so toned i don't know if you're even going to read this but i'm really proud of you definitely search some vegan recipes on youtube it makes it so much easier and eating fruit all day instead of filling fiber-rich foods will leave you super hungry and undercarbed :,1,NOT

i am not vegan or vegetarian at the moment but i have been watching your vlogs for a while and i have a few ideas that i think could help i have noticed that you don't cook for yourself all that often(which honestly i don't either lol however being vegan i hear that you have to learn how to cook or you will get really bored of the food you eat i think it would be smart to look at a lot of the vegan restaurants or healthy restaurants around your area and find out what you like if you do this you have somewhere to eat when you go out and you can always post mate it when you don't feel like cooking again i am not speaking from experience but i feel as though finding these restaurants will open your eyes to new vegan foods you might like and you would have no excuse to not eat vegan good luck trisha!,1,NOT

i thought i was the only one who ate frozen grapes but i usually only eat them when my braces make my teeth hurt.,1,NOT
my biggest advice is to start by eating normally meaning continue to eat the food you loved to eat before eat on vegan restaurants search for vegan replacement products etc to start with and get used to it to not feel like something is missing if you do good without it don't but make sure to eat enough carbs proteins fiber calcium etc don't listen to supposed healthy diet that won't last long just as raw til  this one is made for people who want to maintain their weight or who have a hella fast metabolism which i guess is not yours just as it wasn't mine because i have always been rounder and this does'nt work for that type of body meaning that even if i'm thin i will still be rounder or curvier what works for me and people i know is just to continue eating normal and don't go with the extreme healthy vegan diets yet raw diet raw til ... good luck ,1,NOT
buffalo cauliflower bites are delicious i'd recommend going to julian's vlogs to watch j&j's kitchen jenna is vegan and julian eats gluten free so it's worth a look!,1,NOT

eating meat isn't necessarily the problem as far as animal cruelty is concerned it's factory farming if you are going to eat meat check the source and do the research.,1,NOT
feel free to eat vegan alternative food they are generally healthier than meat/dairy i just wouldn't recommend eating too much.,1,NOT
you go girl my biggest tip for you would be to remember that there is not only one way to eat as a vegan the way freelee and many of the vegans in the youtube vegan community eat is amazing and super healthy but if it's not interesting to you then don't forget that you can literally eat anything so long as it's vegan oreos dairy free ben and jerrys basically any vegan junk  obviously that's pretty unhealthy to live off but my point is just remember you don't have to restrict or deprive yourself of things you love if you feel like having some cookies or ice cream then why not  whatever keeps you vegan girl if you nourish yourself with staples like rice curries pastas potatoes etc chances are you won't even crave junk anyway  good luck!,1,NOT
omg this make has made my day i mean i am vegan and i have seen freelee's video and found out about her and she loved meat but now that she is vegan ya know it is so good that we are one person closer to animals being free i am so happy about her being vegan now and i hope every vegan can now support her even if she is just going to be vegan for to weeks as long as she tries i am so happy so keep going trsh keep going!!!!!!!,1,NOT

hey trish i think it's amazing that you are going vegan for the next two weeks don't be scared about how much to eat or not eat just eat when you are hungry and eat until you are satiated what helps me the most whenever i need new ideas for different vegan meals i always look up vegan what i eat in a day videos they are all so helpful make sure you eat plenty of carbs and starches to fill you up because fruits and veggies alone aren't high in calories at all so you need the carbs to keep you full and give you plenty of energy good luck girl!,1,NOT
i'm so happy for you becoming vegan was the best decision i've ever made i wish you the best of luck!,1,NOT

"why don't they want to compete against the boys there are hardly ever any restrictions that say girls can't compete against the boys if they can qualify this is a stupid as it gets the end result will be 50,00 trans-gender women dominating women's sports and then everyone will just lose interest if you are a girl why would you do all that training when you know you have to compete against a boy with long hair you can't win not even on a good day so you drop out this is the end of female sports but i think it will be a good thing because it highlights how stupid the whole argument is if you want to wear a dress that is fine but the dress isn't what makes you a woman in the same way a suit doesn't make you a man those things are just clothes and makeup somehow we are now confusing clothes and hairstyles and makeup for gender identity"" it's absolutely ridiculous skirts never made a woman a woman and they can't make a man a woman either i think it's all a devious plot to steal scholarships how progressive is that we've actually found a way as devious as it is to give scholarships that were meant for women to men this whole thing is absolutely sick i can't believe that any women especially feminists support this in any way i've seen how soccer clubs handle it and they will let the girls who qualify play on the boy's team if they have no place else to put them that matches their ability but boys on a girl's team absolutely unheard of and it doesn't matter how you self identify"" penis boys so we can make this a lot simpler until your penis and nut sack have been removed you are a boy your hair doesn't matter and neither does your skirt the scottish men have been wearing skirts for years they call them kilts"" but you don't see anyone accuse them of being girls because they are wearing a skirt kilt) and trust me you wouldn't want to unless you are really good at fighting the scottish kilt does not transform the angry fighting man into a docile woman don't mess with him or he will mess horribly with you kilt or not.",2,NOT

to all the people saying that hormone therapy will make this fair why is it never girl to boy transgenders winning in sports they take testosterone why is it only boy to girl transgenders winning stuff why is there no girl to boy transgenders playing in the nhl or nba well i can answer that for you because hormones and if not) male bone density muscle mass larger frame more physical force and stamina there are also factors in our brain-wiring such as men are more risk taking and agressive which would give them an edge if you insist that men compete against women in sports you are actively for eliminating women's sports that's just what it is either you feel sympathy for men who think they are women or you are for obliterating female sports that's your choice.,3,NOT
fucken disgusting. totally pathetic..,5,ABU

"i identify as billie eilish my pronouns are,‚Äùduh! i support transgender people as i'm trans myself",1,NOT
this is like alexandra trusova the figure skater identifying as a man and wiping the floor with the natural born men because she has superior flexibility and her quads are amazing it would be unfair in sports that favour women to allow biological women to compete as men against men as they have the more desired abilities and body shapes this applies to biological men competing in sports that favour masculinity as transgender women it simply isn't fair regardless of what anyone says.,1,NOT
this is so stupid and unfair!! wtf,2,NOT
transgender women=women transgender men=men,1,NOT
it reminds me of the greatest duo in tennis history brothers serena and venus williams their biceps say all.,2,NOT
okay so they are men who identify as women and use hormones which allows them to compete against women or people who identify as women i'm so confused.,1,NOT
they shouldn't be treated as girls...they will never be they are boys...they are not poor...they are cheaters and they use their position to win that is it!!!!after all this how can we like them and treat well????,5,ABU
it's all started with non contact sports but what happen when a contact sports like boxing or mma legalise transgender to compete they would absolutely fucked those women up bigger hands muscle bones.,1,NOT

hey i was born a man but upon further stupidity i now identify as a fart so please dont hate me just accept my stupidity ,1,NOT
nobody is wondering anything basic biology dictates that they have an advantage.,1,NOT
it's very unfair that penis gives you testosterone which is an advantage run against men in your women clothes Ô∏è,3,NOT
testosterone suppression is all well and good but it doesn't change the fact that having male genetics would have blessed these two with.. larger hearts larger lungs increased blood volume higher haemoglobin levels in their blood and on average increased basal metabolic rate longer limbs and denser bones.. to question whether or not they have a built-in advantage in the light of basic understanding of human anatomy biochemistry biomechanics physiology is absurd of course they have an advantage.,1,NOT
hormone therapy can't change male anatomy and build,1,NOT
facts are facts they will never be females naturally this nonsense must stop now let them run with the boys da fuck is wrong with the world now remove them from the sport or create seperate fake shit for them since they are fake period,6,ABU
"the trick is what if you can't win gold,just cut away ur penus and compete with girls and bag gold.",2,NOT
who cares who you have sex with or how you identify this is a sport fact is if we had crazy monsters or beautiful angel faries or a new and ultimate super boring human there would be biological physical differences i mean. i'd like to see the flip side interview with trans females to male in the nhl or nfl or something. it would be an interesting piece to put it lightly so just add a category you don't even have to re invent the landscape if nobody is ashamed of how they identify and nobody is shaming them why not show up to cheer a trans friend on obviously referring to them as they identify male or female at their event the way you would a bio girl or a guy everyone is happy done funny the sjws are seemingly the only ones name calling here haha.,1,NOT
born a man is a man competes with men,3,NOT

sorry women did this to themselves when siding with the intersectional feminists no sympathy you made your bed no lay in it.,3,NOT
they should be competing in against men or other transgenders and not against women,5,ABU
i totally understand that you feel you are a woman inside and you have the right to express that but you have to be honest with yourself you were born with physical advantages that clearly set you apart from cis women,1,NOT
jesus created boys and girls satan is really working hard disrespectful too the most high i put a porsche bumper sticker on a dodge took it too the porsche dealer it's confirmed that it's still a dodge,3,NOT
theyre men ofcourse they'll be at an advantage against women,1,NOT
they should be able to run with female runners they have taking treatment for testosterone so whats the difference,1,NOT
yea this isn't fair testosterone has some major effects on the body if they were castrated maybe but if they still have testicles this isn't fair.,2,NOT
of course it is unfair!!! that is the reason why men and women have always competed separately!! if transgender want to compete compete against each other not other women or men they have too much testosterone to compete against women.,1,NOT
more dislikes then likes,1,NOT
as a transwoman i must say that even if i were to train and train and train every single one of those ciswomen could leave me in the dust in a sprint race  and i have very long legs the notion that transgender women have an unfair advantage over ciswomen in athletics is just not realistic.,3,NOT

i just want to see a woman become a man and dominate men.,1,NOT
lol... men beat women in a sport.,3,NOT
saying that the coaches are welcoming them is probably the dumbest defence i've heard of course they are they'll never lose a race.,2,NOT
girls showd refuse to compete against this two guys let's see if they keep pushing this nonsense gender identity rules that keep this guys killing it in girls sports,2,NOT
this has absolutely nothing to do with someone being transphobic this is simply what's fair and what's not and these two athletes have a definite unfair advantage over the other girl athletes this is about what's right and what's wrong and this is wrong on all accounts i'm all for you being whoever you want to be and whoever you choose to identify as but if that choice puts you in an advantageous situation over another then that's when it's cheating...period.,1,NOT
her parents are complete idiots it's not fair to everyone else so you should remove your freak daughter,6,ABU
i identify as a baby boa!,2,NOT
this isn't considered cheating but using steroids is?,2,NOT
definitely unfair guys are faster than girls,1,NOT
 they're happy in turn making me happy so why don't we keep the people calling for you to run on the side where biology states you should be happy to make everyone happy and in turn making you happy?,1,NOT
metoo where yall at when your really needed and stop referring to these mistakes as she and her,5,ABU
biologically unfair af,1,NOT
this is so wrong on so many levels why are the parents not talking about how the transgender did actually try to race the on the boys track team and didn't do well and that is why they went to the girls track team.,2,NOT
but this is trash and very stupid insensitive and unfair why do females who turn to male not partake in male sport ???i guess we know the answer to that because they cant keep up the way our bodies are formed are very different and that wont change even if they refuse to acknowledge the body in which they were born into their own sport should be made they still retain their muscles and a whole lot of other stuffs that is the composition of a male body its a big disadvantage to people been born female ,2,NOT
the transgender issue is being pushed on us they want to created a genderless raceless religionless society.,1,NOT
look look at your dislikes that's a clear message.,1,NOT
that's so fucked up where are women's rights now?,1,NOT
what happens to a girl caught injecting herself with male hormones she is excluded from the competition well that's the very same thing.,1,NOT
stop the earth rn i'm getting the fuck off !,1,NOT
even in porn they have categories.. just an example as funny as it sound.. they have an award for best female pornstar and an award for best shemale pornstar.. if they wanna compete the state should create another category for transgenders female or male i'm sure that will be more fair.. and that's not discrimination it just common sense,1,NOT
of course both of these transgendered boys well they have not transitioned so they are boys would say that it is not fair for them because they are not thinking of others but want everyone to think about their situation which they chose us women were born women and had to fight to title ix and respect in the sports field while they are taking advantage of the fact that they are still male physically something else us women have to fight against!!!,3,NOT
she is a hater and then don't they take hormone therapy so it going to replace testosterone rt,2,NOT
how you gonna have a penis racing against girls,3,NOT
3:0 how deluded do you have to be to say something like that holy cow?!?,5,ABU
it's simple men are provenly dominant physically to women so just because these transgenders mentally are women that doesn't mean that they are physically women so therefore is like putting a male to compete against females.,1,NOT
i'm no heterosexual but i still think and feel like this is very unfair all of the observable science points to that fact you can literally find more testosterone in those dudes than the other ladies out there like wth i'm so confused and to all of the leftist out there shouldn't you be supporting women from toxic masculinity to the equality of the sexes there are so many contradictions i don't get it are you just trolls or am i really missing something is this a joke or what?? i am so confused!??!!!!!?,1,NOT
science your feelings,1,NOT
i thought men and women are the same aha,1,NOT

when you see them run it's so obvious that they physically have an advantage as a result of their biological gender all for them being transgender but i would be upset too.,1,NOT
gma you're ridiculous this is absolutely unfair i like how they say they just worry about the well being of the transgender teens what about the well being of the real girls?,3,NOT
i think if they want to compete they should have to wear a set of balls hanging out the back of their pants like on jackass.,1,NOT
this is what happens when you have no daddy you want to become your mom or grandma,2,NOT
this is like a man taking alot of steroids,3,NOT
it's about more than just winning a metal for some girls they work their asses off to compete and have a chance to become an elite athlete and that's being taken away i support equality but isn't what equality is this is going to ruin women's sports it's sad to see after years of women fighting to just be able to play sports at all and be respected and now this /,1,NOT
when the one athlete's like if they're happy that should make me happy' but that's really not how it works in sports like oh yeah if the other team is happy about our pitcher being down i should be happy too ,1,NOT
how ridiculous they decided they were girls they decided they wanted to participate in girls sports i'm sorry you can't decide to have a chromosomal structure that you have.,3,NOT
i don't even know where to start with thid,2,NOT
they should not be able to compeat agenst biological women..,5,ABU
the well being of the children should triumph no one wants to be transgender believe me.,5,ABU
they can also do more pull ups push ups and sit up than those born girls the girls who came in rd and th place are the real st and nd place winners i have absolutely nothing against the transgender community be who you feel you are in your soul but come on this should be a no brainer!! this shouldn't even be a debate.,1,NOT
wnba is gonna be lit in a few years,1,NOT
is this the equality they wanted?,1,NOT
unfair and wrong they went through puberty as a boy bone density and size is different should be no further discussion.,3,NOT
girl's athletics will soon be completely destroyed because of this nonsense if you have xy chromosomes everywhere except for half of your sperm you are a male if you have xx chromosomes you are a female period that's science i don't care what hormones you take or what you take to supress other hormones i don't care if you mutilate your body to change your outward appearance i feel tremendous empathy for your confused feelings but your feelings don't change the fact that you are physiologically male males should compete against other males females should compete against other females to do otherwise flies in the face of science and gives a tremendously unfair advantage to boys pretending to be girls maybe it's time to add two more categories to student athletics boys who think they are girls and girls who think they are boys then the playing fields are level and no one has an unfair advantage.,3,NOT
you fucking abominations.,6,ABU
when the one girl mentioned that she was looking at social media comments about her the reporter said some of those comments were harsh like saying terry and andrea had an unfair advantage because they were boys. that's not a harsh comment at all that's just someone stating the facts there's a reason they have separate sporting events for men and women there's a reason they have the women's record and the men's record in track and field one of the trans girls mothers commented during her interview it allows her to be who she wants to be and that has more weight than winning a medal not to the girls competing against her who are trying to get college scholarships it's great that she has loving supportive parents but i hope people realize this is a complicated issue...and being against them competing in state finals has nothing to do with being anti transgender.,1,NOT
i agree with the state rules of those states it makes the most sense however i don't think trans people should be completely prevented from competing with the gender they are transitioning to it's a slippery slip but it just reminds me of the argument of it being unfair that blacks are competing with other races because they naturally are faster so it's unfair‚Äù.,1,NOT
so one has a gay father and a transgender mother both of them look like boys in drag this why the trans community gets push back these biological boys with hormone additives shouldn't be competing in a race with biological girls.,5,ABU
except you're feminine..fine .except you like what other women like fine...you're still a man. acceptance is a big part of life and santa isn't real.,2,NOT
it's like gold plated vs gold just because something is dressed up in gold doesn't mean it's gold through and through they should be ashamed of themselves,5,ABU
if you're really that butt hurt about it then get better and win instead of complaining,3,NOT
ive seen trans girls run tht look like a man and identify as a male and they ran with women soo this should be the same they r natural born men tht identify as a female they should run with other boys,5,ABU

another parallel between you and i trish i am too attempting to go vegan i hate meat dont like eggs the only think im having a hard time with is dairy milk/cheese i love me some fruits and veggis and nuts and rice and beans etc.. my downfall is sugar which technically is ok to eat when vegan so i need to find some self control on that front... the common mistake i am making is just like when you said you accidentally had starbucks that had milk you have to break the bad habits~ one good thing is that there is so many channels and websites out there to help you know what to eat.... i suggest before going to any food restaurants ie taco bell starbucks cheesecake factory etc.. you check out their menu online and figure out what you will order prior to going i know its easy to be caught up in the whole process and order things that you used to order or you get there and you dont want to hold up the line so you order something without thinking it through you have to remember that its easy to go vegan and stay fat trust me i know this i too am about 00lbs too and i too hope to get healthier through going vegan) french fries are vegan but when you get them say from mcdonalds or bk they are soaked in salt then salted again and again and again when being served then the fried aspect on top of that.. i know you know this i just used that as an example . usually. hardcore vegans arent vegans to be skinny. they are vegan because they are against all animal cruelty. then the health benefits are just a plus you can get vitamins too to help you make sure youre getting everything your body needs maybe freelee can help with telling you which you should take while doing this week vegan diet love you bunches trisha and i know you can do it dont cheat,1,NOT

for going vegan try to stick with whole foods as much as possible for the best results eat lots of vegetables like piles of vegetables and eat lots of fruit too a great way to get protein in lentils and beans also edamame pasta or black bean pasta is very high in protein there are also vegan protein powders and tofu and setian which is a made from wheat and lentlis and red beans this product is very high in protein there is tempeh too and also nutritional yeast also high in protein is chia seeds is around  grams or so protein for tablespoons even though it's high protein ist also high in fats it's a good fat but for plant based diet you want to keep your fat low don't consume too much of it i hope this was helpful and i hope your journey is successful  i've eben vegan for weeks now and i keep my protein high because i lift and want to keep my musle and i don't really low fat so far it works for me ),1,NOT

larabars they're super yummy and they're nice to have as a quick snack through the day when you're feeling peckish i love eating rice with some potatoes and onions and other stuff but going vegan is all about getting creative with your meals the meat and dairy industry is so huge that it makes it nearly impossible to just go to the store be able to grab some food without worrying if it's vegan or not whole foods will be your best friend! pasta is yummy and sooo filling potatoes rice and beans are always great just be careful when i started out vegan i got the same advice but for some reason i never thought to add anything in to my food to make it taste better so more often than not i was sitting there eating plain rice and getting full but hating what i was eating imagine if you just cooked a burger patty but didn't add any spices or literally anything at all to it and just ate the cooked ground beef not yummy same applies to vegan food if you don't spice it up pun intended it'll definitely make you start to resent going vegan i recommend following lots of twitter/instagram/pinterest/youtube accounts that are vegan so you can stay motivated and find new tasty recipes i know i'm not the only one who's obsessed with those buzzfeed cooking videos so it's the same concept you see something tasty you want it just make sure it's vegan good luck girl! you might get discouraged at times but that's completely natural keep your end goal in sight stay positive and love yourself! you can do it 3,1,NOT

i wouldn't exactly say that you can eat as much as you want without gaining weight or even for weight loss normally the amount you want to eat is equal the amount you need if you don't have disordered eating habit though if you have been restricting for so long then you might want to eat more than you need which results in gaining weight but this shouldn't scare you off since you need your body to gain that weight in order to cure the metabolic damage and increase your basal metabolic rate and eventually you'll be at an optimal weight for your body type hope this was helpful üíï,1,NOT

and btw the weight falls off effortlessly like i wasnt even trying to lose weight and lsot so much at first,1,NOT
"nonono you cannot eat as much as you want, when you have the mindset of wanting to lose weight calories in vs calories out you need to be in a calorie deficit in order to lose weight eating food will not make you lose weight no matter what any miracle website out there tells you find out what your maintenance calories are the calories required to stay at your current weight and then eat under that there are ,50 calories in one pound so as long as your total caloric deficit per week is around there you will drop a pound per week which is healthy) also do not let these hclf people tell you avoid fat no fat. you need fats in order to absorb certain vitamins and it aids in protein synthesis which helps build tissue produce cells) make sure you're doing this in a healthy manner do more research and find out what it is that you need to do i weight lift on a higher carb vegan diet 60-70 of my calories comes from carbs and it works for me so i can tell you that doing the lifestyle right will produce great results that you can stick to but if you do this completely blind you're gonna end up hitting a wall because someone turned you onto a vegan fad diet understand what macro and micronutrients are what they do to your body and how they work in sync with others make sure you're getting what your body needs depriving yourself will put your body at great risk) understand calories in vs out etc etc just be smart about this and it will work trish good luck 3",1,NOT

when freelee says you can eat as much as you want on a vegan diet she means that if you're eating nutrient rich foods i.e fruits vegetables legumes starches and a little of fats like avocado) you can eat as much as you want because those foods are less calorically dense than meat and dairy and fats if you go vegan and eat fried french fries oreos or foods that are vegan imitations of non-vegan foods you'll gain weight.,1,NOT

trisha fyi the only reason freelee is scary skinny is because she has an eating disorder after she eats large quantities of food in restaurants she goes home and throws it up bulimia. so please don't aspire to her diet for the reason of obtaining her body there are several signs on her body that give it away you can tell she is malnourished her muscles are shrinking in her arms and other places also if you eat a lot of carbs potato chips pasta etc you will gain weight but then again you're used to eating a lot of high-calorie food so just keep an eye on it with your scale at home good luck,3,NOT
oh gosh i'm so happy to see this happening congrats trish so happy for this big step you're taking some tips to get you started...don't starve yourself eat until you're full no point in over-eating you can always eat later when you get hungry again buy tons of potatoes rice pasta starches to keep you full fruit to give you energy basically that's it whenever you want something more consistent go for the starches if you want energy and a light belly go for the fruit but do never ever starve yourself also googling vegan recipes is a great way to see yummy stuff to eat check out vegan corner for easy amazing recipes aaand if you don't wanna cook i'm sure there's tons of vegan places there just ask them to not cook stuff with oil that's pretty much it hope it helps i'm so happy for you and proud good job girl you can always come to us vegans for advice we'll guide you through this journey and of course freelee as well d xx,1,NOT

sure the estrogen treatments will bring the testerone levels down but even with that they're still going to have a lot more testerone in their bodies than the average female walking around a lot more and then of course you have the difference of bone structure so of course they have an advantage they're men saying they're transgender or taking estrogen doesn't change that their chromosomes are still xy and always will be god bless them and i hope one day they come to the truth.,5,ABU

they should compete with other men i wrestled a transgender he didn't seem to have a problem competing with other men he didn't claim he was a female he had that smoker's voice that menopause voice i didn't know until my instructor said he was a transgender point of the story if you're a guy or have a dick between your legs or was born with a dick between your legs compete with other dicks,5,ABU
even as a trans person i think this is unfair like i would get it if they transitioned before they went through male puberty because then it would be equal but they have gone through male puberty and science is science they have an advantage,3,NOT

trish one thing that could help your new vegan lifestyle could be going on walks i know one thing is i joined a cross country team in th grade i used to run a  min mile but now i run a  min mile walking is a great step to running running has so so so many good things about it anybody can do it no matter the size cause i know i wasnt the skinniest in cross country it can also improve your mood and lastly it is a very effective way to be healthy i know that if you do want to work on this and be able to continue it you have to start slow and be patient i know that i never was near the front even when i was improved but that doesnt matter what matters is that your time improved if you do want to start this activity i recommend first walking maybe half a mile every day for about days then you try to run/jog a full mile i remember running my mile for the first time i would stop every mins probably one way to gain back energy but not stop and take a rest is just by slowing down even if you have to walk to gain energy back your still going somewhere and continuing anyway if you do want to do this practice walking then you need to try your hardest to run/jog a mile when doing the mile you need to have a timer going when you are done with your mile and have your mile time write it down somewhere you will always see it and then when you go on more runs you can easily figure out how fast you've gotten how long it would probably be to go an extra distance i also recomenned getting a certain type watch fitbit orsomething like it or getting a app on your phone one thing that gets me motivated to run is getting new running gear i recommend not ordering online the prettiest one by a over the top brand but instead find a local running gear store near you and get you walk checked and feet checked to find the perfect shoe for your feet that will help so much i hope you get to see this advice love you! blndsundoll4mj,1,NOT
some great vegan sources of protein are beans/lentils/legumes especially in combination with grains like rice or buckwheat tofu is a good protein source seitan or wheat meat is also great if you have time/interest you can make it at home very cheap and easy but you can also get it at most health food stores eat a wide variety of fruit and vegetables most of which for the record also have protein in them i wouldn't worry too much about protein in general most americans actually eat close to twice the recommended amount in a day it's pretty easy to get enough definitely do some research on getting the nutrients you need because at first it can be difficult but once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy if you're having cravings there are some good substitutes for meat and dairy products that you can get and vegan desserts are definitely a thing  there are so many great vegan recipes/recipe blogs online you can find recipes for everything from super healthy raw food to vegan triple chocolate cake some of my personal favorites are chickpea salad sandwiches stir fry and fajitas and don't feel bad about getting stuff in packages you don't have to o everything all at once start with what's easier for you.),1,NOT

if u dont want to cut out dairy a good way to get rid of a huge pimple is to rub ice on it and then put some eye drops that are for red itchy eyes on it and the ice will make the puffiness go down and the eyedrops get rid of the redness this is a life saver cause on the day of my choir concert i was singing a huge solo and i got a pimple i used this trick and it went away,1,NOT

"hey trish dietary pointers from a vegetarian of years and a vegan of  beans beans_ beans are high in fiber essential proteins other nutrients like iron and amazingly low in calories there are a wide variety of beans the most recognizable probably being chickpeas used in hummus and kidney beans despite having a poorer stigma kidney beans are absolutely delectable prepared right i actually have images of kidney bean tacos on my ig l3ehind  anyway be sure to explore the beans there is inevitably going to be at least one that you find enjoyable nuts though high in calories nuts supply essential fatty acids walnuts are known to boost neuron activity in the brain for example pasta eat pasta pasta is extremely high in protein and caloric it is a grain of course buying a pasta with the least amount of ingredients displayed on the side is recommended the simpler the healthier) will facilitate finding a dairy-free product as well also a note gluten-free pasta is actually calorically lighter than regular pasta i don't require gluten-free products but i enjoy the taste of gluten-free pasta for dairy free cheese products and the like look at brands like earth balance daiya and all the others search dairy free cheeses and dairy free milks on google there's a wide array of milks for example all differing in taste and consistency soy milk almond milk cashew milk pea milk hazelnut milk oat milk flax milk rice milk hemp milk etc commercial sweets i know of to be coincidentally vegan are vanilla oreos nutter butters etc look that up too- mainstream vegan sweets products or even vegan junk food"" obviously best in moderation most chips are vegan.",1,NOT

the thing about vegan is that it's litterally no animal type food whatsoever like no eggs milk ofcorse chicken hamburgers etc soups n tbings like that and because you arent eating eat you definitely have to find a good source of protein so like lotssss of beans and sometimes vegans will have to take protien supplements but have to watch what they are other than that just making sure you are balanced then you could probably eat as much as you want there are also other diets like the kill catch grow method which is if you don't kill catch or grow it then don't eat it or there is paleo or vegetarian plenty of things to try just really have to find what works for you so that if you want to then you could have it be a life style instead of just a few weeks type of thing ),1,NOT

so proud of you trish its so great that you want to eat healthfully instead of starving yourself to loose weight please remember though that you might not loose weight within two weeks and i hope you'll stick with veganism anyway we all know that weight loss doesn't happen overnight and takes months or years so please don't give up on being vegan if you don't see fast results my tips for being and staying vegan are  fuck all the vegan diets like rt sorry freelee) fully raw etc all you need to do is eat whole plant foods by this i mean basically anything from the produce section of the store also beans legumes lentils pasta rice oats  try new things find a recipe that looks yummy and make it try to veganize your old favorites try the vegan meat/cheese alternatives know that there will be things you love and things you hate but that's just a part of the process  prepare food ahead of time make sure you have something to snack on or have lunch prepared before you get hungry so you don't give up and get fast food or something this also applies to going out to eat research the menu ahead of time so your not flustered when you get there  read all the labels every single packaged thing you buy please read the labels never assume that something is vegan companies love to sneak milk fat or skim milk into everything  it's not just about you i know you are doing this mainly for health reasons which is completely fine but it's so helpful to remember and think about all the lives you are saving by eating this way when it gets tough just know you are helping animals and the earth  i really hope this helps you trish i'm so happy for you Ô∏è,1,NOT

carrots and hummus is amazing also anything morning star and also when you go to starbucks if you must cause that's all sugar just ask for soy milk to replace the dairy don't put salt on your food at first your tongue needs time to adapt and you'll soon realize that veggies will actually seem to have changed taste perceptively also ben and jerry's has vegan ice cream that fuckin kills itüëèüèª,1,NOT

hey im a sexy vegan bodypillow,2,NOT
trish my advice would be to eat many meals a day to increase your metabolism and to eat a lot of fruit for your digestion,1,NOT
hey i'm a vegetarian but most of the time in practically vegan i eat dairy maybe twice a week or so) and i looovee vegan food because you can get socreative with it it's really hard for many people to transition especially whn you're a meat fan and stuff you were asking about other foods besides fruit that you can have on a vegan diet and i can give you some ideas whicha re totally delicious and most people who eat meat love these as well and don't realize they are eating a vegan meal when they eat these pasta prepared vegan in a million ways bread whole wheat is so much better for you're health and physique sorbet this is a great replacement for ice cream vegan ice-cream yup! there is vegan ice cream made with vegan milks that taste just as good rice you can make veggie-fried rice vegetable curry my personal favorite quinoa which is an amazing and super delicious protein packed meal it can be prepared in different ways as well.. cold hot peanut butter make sure to get all natural or make your own at home by blending roasted peanuts w no salt don't add water almond rice soy milk frappucinos with soymilk putting caps so you know you can still drink those fraps girl just ask for soy milk or rice milk! nuts walnuts peanuts pistachios almonds! these are great protein packed snacks they also have healthy fats cereals check the package says vegan and low sugar is the best option vegan cheese almond cheese resembles mozzarella vegan yogurt made with almond or coconut milk acai bowls papaya bowls with no yogurt pitaya bowls hummus great for snacking with crackers carrots celery cucumber. etc mashed potatoes broccoli cauliflower etc with no cream!! oatmeal cna be prepared in so many delicious ways use almond coconut or rice milk or water ....so this is all that i could think of at the moment i really hope you can get back on track with veganism because it's not only great for you but also for the environment my recommendation is checking out some vegan restaurants near where you live do so through yelp or google it) so you can see how many different delicious options are placed on the menu and maybe you can get some ideas to cook yourself at home believe me veganism is great and fruit is not the only option you have for food and what i love the most about it is that you can get so creative with everything quick head's up marshmallows gelatine and gum are made with grenetine which comes from animal bone marrow not vegan of course. and quite disgusting) but there are vegan marshmallows which actually taste pretty good vanilla-ish and there's vegan chewing gum as well there are infinite vegan desserts that you can make too it's all about looking for recipes online unless you are the most creative person on earth at the kitchen) i hope this helps a lot! and i hope that you can last as a vegan now knowing that fruit isn't the only thing we eat haha:),1,NOT
trish i love grapes but freeze them and they taste like ice cream... 3,1,NOT

yes go trish fruit is great but personally when i went vegan cooked food was easier when transitioning to lots of rice veggie stir fries are my go to if you are trying to loose weight try to stick more to whole foods and less to processed fake meats and cheeses cuz they have a lot of fat and salt usually but don't be too hard on yourself eat whatever you feel like as long as its cruelty free  you can do it,1,NOT
i feel like this is old footage because i am part of the snapchat fam but good luck if you're starting over now for the next two weeks hugs,1,NOT

first off tricia you are beautiful no matter who is standing next to you or what the number of the scale says as far as food goes no need to worry about protein all plant foods contain adequate amount of amino acids and as long as you eat a variety of plants you will meet your protein needs worrier any problem the most important thing to remember is to limit as much fat as you can and load up on carbohydrates you'll have to get over your fear of carbs such as pasta breads and potatoes and rice and of course fruit too but that won't be enough calories for you long-term) make your food tasty maybe look up some delicious recipes such as curry stir fry or go on youtube or on freelee's channel also i would highly recommend going to vegan restaurants so you can still enjoy delicious food and not feel deprived.,1,NOT
though fruits are definitely healthy and good for you they contain sugar and some are higher in sugar than others i remember grapes being one of them) i think you need to be careful of the amount of fruits you eat good luck with the diet üèªüëçüèªüëçüèª,1,NOT

sigh...trish you say you're done with trolling and want to stop making problematic videos and yet here you are going vegan isn't the same as a diet where you say you're gonna cut out red meat or carbs it's a lifestyle the lifestyle you like to live is quite honestly the opposite of everything vegans stand for you literally just unboxed a bag made from dead animal skins the other day the majority of your makeup skin and hair care products aren't cruelty free you're wasteful and harm the environment because of all the plastic cutlery and paper plates you use if you want to get in shape guess what...you gotta work out you gotta eat veggies and healthy proteins you gotta cut back on the alcohol.,2,NOT

eat only whole plant foods like brown rice potato and fruits for great health and maximum weight loss if you are scared about protein beans like lentils are your best friends with this you will have more nutrients than with almost all other diets animal protein or not and avoid vegan processed foods including bread) they will make you fat no matter how vegan they are they're totally fine once in a while but only if you ate properly for a long time and it will harm the whole plant food weight loss that you can get when coming off of a animal protein diet,1,NOT

watch hot for food and mommy tang its good meal inspiration im sure there is many more!,1,NOT
always always be smart and ask questions when you go out to eat don't buy animal products just because the rest of ur friends are you have to keep motivated and with veganism your have to eat a larger volume of food to get more calories because plant foods are less calorie dense.. which is sometimes the reasons why you can get full easier since ur stomach is much more filled up than with a small piece of meat at the bottom of your stomach and also keep track of vitamin intake you're most likely going to lack in vitamin b1 so maybe purchase a supplement or fortified foods to help overcome that and also a lot of plant foods contain non-heme iron which is harder to absorb than heme iron(in meats but to fix that you need to keep up your vitamin c levels orange juice vitamin gummies in order to absorb it more efficiently and protein should be fine if you eat more lentils and quinoa(especially quinoa because it is a perfect protein).that's my advice for u good luck!,1,NOT
broccoli holds more protein than steak so you could try that but not many loves broccoli beans are great i'm so excited for you to go vegan!,1,NOT
as being a vegan you can't eat anything that deals with animals on land and sea milk eggs or honey for breakfast you can have bagel with vegan cream cheese toast with jelly pancakes fruit smoothie tofu scramble with veggie sausage fruit-filled toaster pastry and for lunch/dinner veggie burger or hot dog with fries mock lunchmeat sandwich with chips faux meat with baked or mashed potatoes and gravy vegetable stir-fry with tempeh tofu or seitan falafel pita sandwich with hummus or tabouli peanut butter and jelly sandwich i have a lot of recipes you can try if you want to contact me,1,NOT

whatever you do no soy it has an abundance of estrogen and not the healthiest thing almond milk is a great source of protein as does chia seed and flax seed these are little ways to sneak in protein obviously tofu and quinoa are amazing sources of protein as well carbing the fuck up is a great idea too even tho many don't agree with it enjoy being a vegan ))))),1,NOT
not like she did a whole video on making eggs and bacon.,2,NOT
alright i feel like this needs to be said i never comment on her videos but i see more hate here than on any other channel it's annoying because most of you don't realize that  she likes the hate it's attention  the hate she gets is perpetuating the on the kitchen floor videos and anything similar trish reads the comments and sees the views and then she does whatever it takes receive that same amount of attention  most of you think that she's just a stupid blonde but look at her she will soon be approaching million subscribers and she gets tons of views she lives in la in an extremely nice house drives a g wagon and has designer everything despite what you think about her lifestyle the only thing most of you have to complain about her is her weight problem. i'm not saying she is healthy by any means and she clearly has an eating disorder but she's at least aware of it she clearly has some psychological issues with attention disorders anxiety depression and she gets attached to things and people which indicated an addictive personality not to mention her past drug use) she has issues so does everyone else however she works harder than most other youtubers i watch she posts consistently and has a hugely wide variety of content she's open on the internet and if you actually listen to some of the serious things she talks about she's more intelligent than you might initially think i'm not saying she makes the best choices and i don't agree with everything about this girl but i can appreciate someone who takes this much time toward something she works hard on her music/dancing which isn't my favorite but i still applaud her for keeping up with it anyway what have most of you done with your perfect lives?,1,NOT
why i don't feel like this is true i feel like she is saying this just for a paycheck and won't actually do it.,2,NOT
you need to eat before you get hungry if you start craving meat and dairy it's because your brain wants calories eat rice pasta potatoes smoothies bowls for breakfast look on youtube for recipes quick vegan meals if you don't cook much!,1,NOT
im so proud of you!!! this is amazing trish -),1,NOT
glad you are making an effort to go vegan trish i'm cheering you on üçâüççüçå don't pay attention to the people dragging you down even if you nake mistakes. no one is perfect!,1,NOT
baby steps i feel like you're doing it all in one go and you have a lifetime of habits to change in order to fully transition give yourself a chance i think that making good lifestyle choices like picking the right products to consume over food that is bad for your body is a great thing i wish your reasons were less superficial but then again we are guilty of that in my opinion changing your diet around like this should be more about what you enjoy eating that is good for your body and soul which doesn't always mean that you need to become vegan it is entirely possible to live a vegan lifestyle but the lack of nutrients that you get from animal products may affect you in the long run you should consider yourself lucky if it happens sooner than that so that you can try something else until you find something that works for you lastly the argument we were never supposed to eat animal product is bullocks honestly just look at the structure of your teeth front teeth are sharper-edged to tear into meat easier the back teeth are from grinding your food until you are able to swallow which also aids your digestion herbivores aka vegans of the animal kingdom have flat/dull teeth because flora and fauna do not require the shredding action of sharper teeth i hope this is helpful in any way and if i may ask please do not follow all of freelee's dietary advice especially not because it works for her and she's super skinny now she has no training or education on this subject at all please consult a physician and a dietitian to figure out what foods you should eat and which you should avoid according to your body type and the current state of your health i highly recommend this last part you should always seek professional advice from certified practitioners tldr freelee is full of shit eat the health foods that you genuinely enjoy talk to an actual doctor and an actual dietitian.,1,NOT
i think you should just watch what i ate in a day from vegan channels also get an audio book on veganism like skinny bitch it's awesome and i think it would definitely speak to you.,1,NOT
you can eat beans rice any veggies flax seeds) etc its actually a pretty easy diet but it takes time you just cannot eat or wear anything made from animals you cant wear leather btw but you can eat anything that is not an animal product good luck!,1,NOT

yeahh girl 3!! good luck going vegan changed my life in so many ways if you remember me like  years ago i was a mess although i photoshopped my pictures lol) in person i looked like i was falling apart i didn't realize i had a toxic effect from meat i just knew it always made me feel lethargic after eating it now i know i have a gene that gives me dna damage from smoked and cooked meat when certain chemicals are released) i am also lactose intolerant but was drinking milk anyway and have bad reactions to simple carbs processed sugar and preservatives.. i was 0 lbs heavier i had sleep disorders paralasis and nocturnal panic attacks) add mood swings cysts and a bunch of other issues. i had no idea how sensitive i was till i started eating clean i lost  lbs and i felt better than i have ever felt in my life no brain fog so much focus energy and people were telling me at  that i looked younger and better than i did at 1. it literally changed my life..beyond the little good karma vibes from knowing i'm doing a good thing for the environment/animals ,1,NOT
i truly have been wanting to attempt veganism as well when i'm hungry i'm not even thinking about what i'm eating or how many calories it is i hope to join you on this journey please post the process if you can.. i can easily purchase a book i suppose but i feel that it will be motivating to see your progress too good luck!,1,NOT

yes omg beans and rice and lentils are so versatile in cooking!!! so many dips and falafels are surprisingly vegan going vegan also encourages a lot of home cooking like curries and other rice dishes dips and cool potatoes so try to make time for that too just remember that a lot of junk food may be vegan but that doesnt mean its healthy also for chocolate most dark chocolate should use soy instead of cow milk also drink loads of water just for the general toning of your body and keep dancing good luck trisha congratulations üíúüíúüíú,1,NOT

you shouldn't be worried about over eating you really need to make sure you get all the vitamins and nutrients that you'd normally get in dairy and meats such as proteins and vitamin b12 i recommend getting some nut/oat/soya milk with no added sugar and also non dairy butter to make the diet easier also make lots of lentil/pulse soups which are really yummy and filling good luck!,1,NOT
yet you were eating mcdonald's,1,NOT
i did the same thing you're doing about proclaiming it out loud i was stuck in a pescetarian phase for almost a year really struggling to make the commitment to veganism so at work i told everyone i was vegan from that day on and so i was it definitely helps to put it out into the world i lost  pounds in the first four months of going vegan and even though it wasn't my goal to lose weight during this process it is a super bonus the first two weeks is a bit of a struggle but after that as long as you eat well and nourish your body it'll be the best decision you've ever made the best advice i can give you is that if you mess up allow yourself to move on a lot of people feel like if they messed up once then it's hopeless and they want to stop being vegan you just have to accept the fact that it's an entirely new lifestyle you have to get used to and you will accidentally eat things that you wouldn't even think weren't vegan just take each moment as a learning experience and enjoy your journey!,1,NOT

trish this is so amazing i'm so excited for you from one vegan to a now vegan in my opinion any reason to change your diet to veganism is a good reason i went mostly for ethical reasons but losing weight and toning up happens regardless if you're trying this out for two weeks in order to feel a little slimmer for your shoot try to only drink water lemon water will help a ton to lose bloating that might occur when increasing your vegetable/fruit intake eat when youre hungry please please do not restrict freelee is right you can eat as much as you want if youre eating a plant based diet raw or not the first week you might be a little gassy or a little bloated but don't let this discourage you! by the end of week two your body will have adapted a lot more to the new diet so you should be waking up looking nice tight i hope you see this as i want you to be successful in this as it can be a total and complete game changer quinoa beans and any dark green vegetable will be high in protein i encourage you to look up vegan recipes to play around with it's fun and don't be afraid to try different vegan restaurants in your area they can open your eyes as to how wonderful food on this lifestyle can be good luck trish and keep digging around youtube and the internet for vegans that inspire you muah xx,1,NOT

wow.. this is great my tip would be to eat as much as you want within a meal avoid snacking between meals) and don't be too fanatical about exactly what it is you're eating i.e how healthy it is as if you can find things you enjoy and also make you satiated the longer you're going to stick with it and actually become less obsessive about what you're missing out on also don't worry about what others think or say about your choices just know within yourself and be happy within yourself that you are doing this for the right purposes ),1,NOT

make sure to get alot of protein you dont need meat for protein!,1,NOT
for proteins stock up on nuts beans green veggies also for new vegans they have fake meats that taste very real that have protein make the transition easier if you have any cravings to make it fun i would look up fun recipes on youtube or pinterest frozen fruits are really great for snacks and smoothies plus you don't have to worry about them going bad.,1,NOT
that's great that you're gonna eat vegan even if it's just for a couple of weeks finally you'll be able to take the meat goggles off and really look at the meat and dairy industry from the outside-in regardless of your reasons to do it you'll still be doing it at the end of the day and i'm sure if you do it the right way with the help of the community including freelee you'll be on the right track and you'll see the way you feel during and even after hopefully you stay vegan for your own sake and the animals' overall good for you for taking this huge step towards bettering yourself üëèüëèüëè,1,NOT

the only reason why freelee can eat as much as she wants is because she has a ton of lean muscle mass the more muscle mass one has the more calories their body burns naturally this is why body builders have to eat so much trust me i went on rt and a regular vegan diet with not very much muscle mass ate as much as freelee recommended gained 0lbs freelee can eat huge amounts of food because of her lean muscle mass more muscle mass=more calories burned naturally by your body without exercise included do not make that mistake by stuffing your face and thinking you're going to lose weight eat whatever you want but until you feel full and satisfied simply eating like someone like freelee without as much lean muscle mass as her will definitely have you gain weight i've been there and lost all that weight by eating how much i actually needed to according to how many calories my body burns on its own please still carb tf up don't starve yourself eat snacks throughout the day and you'll be sure to losing weight at a healthy pace don't stress over oil or fat or sodium baby steps i wish you the best good luck!,1,NOT

good job trish try getting creative with your foods eat pastas potatoes waffles smoothies being vegan/plant based is fun be aware of the detox stage though o when you first go vegan your body needs to detox from what you are used to eating and you might start to feel sluggish/break out ect hope that doesn't discourage you good luck!,1,NOT

i went vegan months ago and i'm feeling great so far! for protein source i see a medium sized fruit as a g source of protein so that's how i count but i also eat boiled potatoes mashed with brocolli steamed spinach sides of mushrooms peas and olives and shit like that i also have an app called cronometer that sort of trains me to eat enough and gives me clues on how to eat that's how i try to make sure to get like around 0g of protein a day.,1,NOT

i personally competed against terry miller and andraya yearwood and i have noproblem with the idea of them winning the races that they compete in if they identify as a girl then let them compete as one if most of the female student body is acceptant of these very talented girls than the parents shouldnt have a problem they are not the ones racing on that lane track if anything terry and andraya push the rest of the girls to work harder in order to beat them in a race.,1,NOT
this got me thinking about intersexed people... have they been allowed to compete i mean if someone is born both sexes then they might have an unfair advantage or not depending where they get placed to compete men's or women's sports i believe what used to be done in this situation was to just throw them into women's sports i do remember some news stories about this and i have to say it is rather unfair it's not only unfair to the women but to the intersexed as well it would seem a solution would be start another division for intersexed but with so few births being so who would fund it on top of that it wouldn't be fair for transgendered to be thrown in with the intersexed division because of who's taking what hormone could have an unfair advantage so would a fourth subset for transgender athletes be needed again who is going to fund it it gets kind of crazy the transgender thing is one issue but what about those who are intersexed this idea of sports competition seems more legit because intersexed people aren't choosing to be another sex like how it is said about transgendered should sports be off limits to the intersexed and if so wouldn't that be unfair so technically this is the same problem different issue.,2,NOT
it is truly fair to exclude them from competing in women sports people that say men can be changed into women are plan idiots they can take all the hormones they want in the end they are still male their natural default is male they were born male they should not compete as women it come be the only way for them to win it's likely they were losing to makes so hey let's identify as male and compete with women this generation is full of depraved idiotic people.,5,ABU

people should be able to do what they want but they have a lifetime of male testosterone musclar development and bone density that far surpasses the development the female body is capable of even after therapy you can't reverse all of those traits completely you can't argue they don't have a clear innate advantage the question is what as a society are writing going to do about it ,2,NOT
if i feel like a amputee and want to cut off my leg . a doctor would not perform the operation it would be insane but if i feel like a girl i can get my genitalia cut off this is ridiculous we should not make a civil rights issue about feelings.,5,ABU
there is no debating live the life you identify with but compete against the gender you were born as problem solved.,2,NOT
it is not unfair it is just a coincidence they finished in the top.,2,NOT
i know this is a weird comparison but i just thought of it when watching this video when spider-man got his powers he said he could never compete in sports with his newfound powers since he wasn't able to compete before basically he knows he would be at an advantage but he still doesn't compete because he knows it would be unfair i dunno this video makes me think of what he said,2,NOT

what happened to fairnessa and spotmanship????????????????????????????????? or is it always what i want? selfish pricks!,2,NOT
maybe the cisgendered women should boycott competing until transwomen get their own race then there won't be a competition to race in anyways for anyone until something changes cis gendered women need their own category period i also find it disgusting that people have reduced women to the level of estrogen or testosterone found in the body it takes much more than just hormone levels to create a woman after puberty everything from bone density to size and other important changes happen oh yeah remember the menstrual cycle that too women athletes often have to train so hard that they can even lose their periods which is unhealthy and transwomen who have not been through cisgendered female puberty say that if they just make sure the testosterone in their body is at a low enough level that they are biologically women and should compete with them this is madness hormone therapy is there to help someone feel like they are a woman it cannot actually turn you into one biologically it will not make you turn into the woman you would have been had you been through a female not male puberty i think trans people should be protected against violence but they are still not technically the women or men they feel that they are and do not need to be in the same category for sports why can't there be a transgender competition this is not like getting to use the ladies washroom that helps transwomen feel safer far away from potentially abusive cisgendered males this is about competing with cisgendered women scholarships are on the line here biology matters.,2,NOT
participation such activities should based on the sex on your birth certificate,2,NOT

unfair period it's ok to identify as a women but at the end of the day they are physically boys i would not allow my daughter to compete with them period not because they are transgender simply because like you heard on the video doctors do not even know exactly how the hormones are affecting their bodies its sad that those girls who trained hard and work hard to get to that point and they were cheated period we just live in world that allows people to make whatever decisions they want and they want to be treat the same as everyone else but in this cases they are not like most regular girl they have an unfair advantage i bet if it was a more physical sport that like wrestling or soccer everyone would feel differently cause people would be able to see the obvious difference and advantage and strength and some case size i mean i get it we want them to feel normal but did anyone think the girls are being robbed of a experience as well.,2,NOT
lol straight up men this is so unfair wtf,2,NOT
those girls are ugly as fuuuuck,2,NOT
if a man takes anabolic steroids to alter his hormones it's unfair in a competitive sport against other natural men so what about a transgender man who takes hormone therapy to compete against other natural men what about a transgender woman who takes hormone therapy to compete against other natural women?,2,NOT
"there are 50 genetic differences between men and women in this case boys and girls) six thousand five hundred genetic differences that are not changed with hormone therapy or gender reassignment surgery to allow these boys and they are boys to compete in a girls sport category is wrong why isn't there a co-ed team or a transgender team they should not compete on a girls team because they are not girls even if they identify as girls,choose to live their lives as girls etc don't misunderstand me every person deserves to live according to their own free will but that does not entitle you to compete on a female team when you are genetically male 50 genetic differences it's called science bitches!",1,NOT
they said they feel welcome by the staff and other people... that's because if anyone hurts their feelings they would be called racist and homophobic they would be shamed on national tv this is why so many kids are so confused and cant deal with reality most of us see the reality here but obviously they cant quit lying to our kids i feel bad for the girls competing against these boys but i also feel bad for the transgender girls its our fault.,2,NOT

i left a super long comment yesterday on t's video explaining much of what you said blaire because i am trans as well and hearing her reasoning made me super concerned for her trolling or not i didn't comment in a way to ridicule her but inform her i feel she is confused on what she feels and who she is again if it isn't a troll) she is not transgender safe to say that she would be transitioning for the wrong reasons entirely and will more than likely regret the choice to undergo permanent steps that she can't come back from i more or less got alarmed when t said paraphrasing gender can change with each day right at the end of the video great work blaire!,1,NOT

i subscribed after the nd video i watched.. just to make sure it wasn't a one time deal in the late 0s i found myself with many gay friends and i would have considered myself a strong proponent for the gay community and for transgender people i served in the military for  years and i have met many gay sailors this was before don't ask don't tell i didn't agree with a lot of the rules etc i really don't think that a persons sexual preference is anyone's business and the gays that i knew . everyone knew and no one cared they were professional and were every bit a sailor some better than i was . a hetero fem one of my best friends was drag at night like i said no one cared in the 0s i used to get really pissed off at women in bars who would dance and make out with each other in bars to pick up men of course this was my opinion but lesbian and gays have fought the good fight for equality and here are women playing lesbian just for a one nighter i never asked a lesbian how they felt about that but for me i felt like it was a slap in the face of lesbians who have been locked in the closet but now it's cool to act lesbian to me it was making a mockery of the being lesbian like playing lesbian as a convenience to get what you want is ok to me it wasn't i may not be entitled to an opinion as i have not lived as lesbian or trans skip to the bathroom situation i am not sure about how schools handle it so i can't comment i fully supported same sex union i felt it was bad judgement for the lgbtq community to force the world marriage on mainstream i more than likely did not fully understand why they needed to use the term marriage in my opinion had the lgbtq community asked for something that should be legal for everyone to engage in a civil union for legal reasons like insurance custody etc. thing would be better for the lgbtq community today then the focus on transgenders and public bathrooms i think this whole mess really put the transgenders back to square one now society has the opinion that transgender some of the crazies i've seen in your videos like i told my friends back when obama was threatening roy cooper and the crap that went down in north carolina transgenders have been around for many many years and they have been using the wrong bathrooms and no one knew i honestly don't thank any truly trans woman has a beard or any facial hair from what i know about a trans male to female that facial hair would feel like acid on there face it just wouldn't be there miss white i had no clue you were trans just another beautiful girl i know there are some trans folks who have not had access to some of the medical treatments you may have had access to but if there are males transitioning to female there are many no medical things a person can do to alter your appearance i used to have a very short hair cut and i'm not for everyday very feminine so i have been mistaken as lesbian a few times i know this is a rant but i guess i'm writing because maybe someone will read this and understand that most main stream people don't hold hatred against lesbian gays and transgenders but the problem is that this has become twisted and perverted and this has became forced on the country and from experience i don't and i don't think anyone else wants to be forced to accept some of the things the lgbtq community is pushing anyway love your show and i wish you all the best and i appreciate that you have your show to educate folks like me and folks not like me!,2,NOT
i agree with you i'm a born female and i dont wear makeup or do my hair every day i'm literally sitting here in sweatpants a tshirt i bought from the men's section and ugg boots with my hair yanked up in a ponytail and no makeup so according to miss trisha over here i must be trans and a drag queen other people have told me i must be gender fluid or something because i like certain things and act certain ways so i must want to be a man which isn't true there is more to it than just how i dress myself or how i act.,2,NOT

i've been watching trish for like a long-ass time i'm just really really concerned about her mental health like i was already concerned and now i'm doubly concerned to me that's all that's really going on here someone needs to intervene and get her some serious help and she needs to stop hanging around enabling people who just go along with whatever she says or does real-ass people tell you when you need to shut up and tell you when you're full of shit nicely but firmly) i don't think she has that person and she's left with her mind and for someone who's really mentally ill and untreated being left with your mind is a terrible terrible scenario i really hope she gets help and that big youtubers don't condone this by automatically agreeing with her statements to get some kind of clout for being a trans-ally or whatever honesty people.,1,NOT

i think you should perhaps rethink what her message was i don't think comparing it to being transgender or your transgender experience is entirely accurate just because i don't think she knows exactly what the term is but regardless she is struggling has hinted towards it for years and it does a lot more harm than good by invalidating someone else's difficulties just because it doesn't seem to make sense she used the wrong terms and comparisons yes no doubt that's more than likely due to ignorance but beyond that she clearly is really hurting and if she's felt this inside since being little...well it's no ones place to take that from her.,1,NOT

"i think trisha needs a break from social media and yt to find herself and establish genuine love for herself if she puts absolutely no effort into transitioning she's not trans as many trans-femme or trans-masculine do they just get to dress up and play the part without actually putting in the effort so,no gigi you don't have to believe her until she starts showing signs of transition which she probably wont if she just said she's okay with her biological birth you can be a more masculine woman that makes you a tomboy not a man you can be a feminine guy you're probably gay..but you're not a woman.",1,NOT

so here's what i'm thinking atm.. i don't think she's transgender. at all. but i do think this is coming from a place of her not having a total grasp on who she truly is not that i can say that i do either there's something psychologically not right with her.. i believe i think her career and poor decisions/drug use has probably made it worse or she's trolling but i'm kind of starting to think her issues run deeper than previous thought.,2,NOT

trisha has been known for trolling yes but she also has been known for emotional unstability and numerous identity crisis i think she has always wanted desperately to feel like she belongs and that explains why she tries to insert herself in the lgbt community in absurd ways do i think she's trans hell no do i think she is legitimately struggling and needs to put some sort of label to it yes i think she believes she's trans and i think she believes that because she needs a concrete answer to a life-lasting issue.,2,NOT

serious question if gender is a social construct then can't she say she is transgender wouldn't we have to believer her because gender can be anything if she were to say she is transsexual then i understand that she is crazy and trolling my understanding is that transgender is when someone identifies as the opposite sex and maybe dresses or acts as such but transsexual is when someone identifies as the opposite sex and takes steps to medically transition just trying to learn thanks  edit so is transgender even a thing then if you are just changing behavior/clothing/style/personality that doesn't have to be a change from one gender to another if it were a change from one gender to another doesn't that just prove that masculinity and femininity are linked to sex idk this entire community is confusing to me i appreciate all insight,1,NOT
ugh.. i just.. just.. stop...,2,NOT
nothing gives you a human the right to tell trisha another human what she is or isn't you are not her girl byyeeee,2,NOT

i totally agree with you love your content.,1,NOT
fuck trolling trashy trisha i was a long time subscriber of hers and chose to look away when she'd past controversial troll videos over the years.. sometimes i even found humor in them however when she faked opiate withdrawal i pulled the plug on financing her hoarding lifestyle as someone who has struggled with opiate dependency due to chronic and deteriorating issues within my spine that was negatively impacted by this hocus pocus bullshit narrative spun by the government across media increasingly so over the past six to seven years in addition to losing several friends and family member because of overdoses because they were strong armed into illegally sourcing opiates which ended up being this imported chinese super fentanyl fancily made to appear like their normal medication that had previously helped them have any sort of quality of life but was ripped away from them because of a god damn government experiment ps earlier this year the opiate epidemic was found by the ciaag to be a government experiment much like the 0s crack issue if anyone would like i can provide a link to their findings which have sources linked to gov web addresses.,2,NOT
just bc trisha is masculine with her assertiveness doesn't mean she's a man women shouldn't think that bc they do something considered manly means that they are a guy vice versa no guys should think they are a woman bc of something feminine these stereotypes were put into place just recently in the grand scheme bc guys used to wear dresses its just fashion and surface stuff i had a bestfriend who was trans and believe me i know the confusion of a trans in the first years of transitioning and for her to make a mockery out of it bc she thinks gay guys are hot.. lol i find a ton of gay guys hot am i trans no,1,NOT

watched this video much too late as in weeks too late i saw london and kalvin's vids though so i already knew this was a thing that happened i just realized something after watching this vid compared to my first impressions after watching london and kalvin's vids causing me to laugh at how ridiculous she sounded she looks like she's on meth given that high meth use can lead to various delusions and even an increased sexual desire i think her crazy thought process could very well have something to do with the fact that she's on drugs i hope i'm wrong if i am there's either something else wrong with her to show that she needs professional help or she's an expert troll playing all of us.,2,NOT

there's quite a bit to unpack here.. sure companies can hire only women and make their discrimination more blatantly obvious but i think taping a please sue me sign on their door would've been cheaper maybe the wage gap is lower fair doesn't mean it doesn't exist even with the same education credentials men still get paid more than women for the same job even aauw one of the sources she uses in the video said so also the point about men and women's common major choices is irrelavent because as confirmed yourself in the beginning of the video the issue is getting paid less for the same job her final point men are more likely to work more hours doesn't debunk women getting paid less for the same work for the same hours now does it thanks for pretending you're going to address the issue for what it is and then dancing around it.,1,NOT

"i have never taken into consideration the gender wage gap that seems to exist today so when the discussion came out during of our classes i was most definitely caught off track and honestly bothered in the youtube video there is no wage gap"" it gave us a bit of sense of why men are paid more due to education occupation position and hours women are paid .7 in comparison to every  that a man makes women are seen to have to juggle being moms with responsibilities inside and outside of work basically women are viewed as weak the video made it seem that women aren't as capable as men when it comes to working long hours especially at a last minute timing women however are not weak i know that they do take more responsibilities than men when it comes to their children but just because women are capable of taking on more roles doesn't mean they should have to face a wage gap when it comes to education i strongly believe everyone should be paid equally yes people get paid more for their seniority at a job but that is due to them having worked their way up there either by being their for such a long time or simply because they do their job right and get promoted in the end everyone should start off by getting paid the same in any career they have the youtube video and the reading we had assigned for homework sheth and gould 2017) includes a graph and tries to use that the excuse for this wage gap is due to women choosing low paid college majors leading to low paid jobs in a sense i see how it is true women go for ore of the motherly careers and i think that's how we women are seemed to be this gender wage gap does exist and some of its reasons provided in the video seem reasonable in the end however the wage gap shouldn't exist no matter the circumstance.",1,NOT

i must say that this video which tries to explain the differences is really quite ignorant yes the differences can be explained by choices but it is not like as a woman you are by nature more likely to go for less paying jobs it is that they are held back by structures in society men are not better rocket scientists and women aren't better suited for being nurses these patterns can be explained it is what the genders stereotypically do that decides google engineer or doctor and then google nurse or kindergarten teacher overrepresentation in better and lower paying jobs has directly to do with the societies view and for these people to flat pit ignore that makes me pissed (,2,NOT
so yesterday i was discussing this subject with my girlfriend and i explained all of this but even though she agreed she came up with an argument i found difficult to refute even if you consider same jobs same position working hours and total time working at a company companies ran by elder males tend to favor career ascension to men instead of women therefore making them earn more mainly because they still live in the past and as a man i have to say i've heard about these cases maybe they don't provide an overall big gender gap but they are a reality thoughts on this?,1,NOT

gotta encourage young women to go into science and professional careers as much as men then hopefully there will be no gap barring the occasional sexist recruiter who thankfully have mostly died out i read about a study a while ago that found that women are more likely than men to not apply for a job if they don't meet all the criteria things like that are what needs to change.,1,NOT
i would like to call myself a feminist it's not to say i want equal pay for all i want equal value of life for all the wage gap is as explained in the video reliant on so many variables i have most knowledge in norwegian studies about this where we have 7 of men's pay mostly because of not willing to work long/graveyard shifts pregnancies prioritising family over ovetime the difference in pay if you work for the private or official sector and people under  tend to earn less than their peers no matter the gender there is still a big gap though taking the electricians in norway as an example with the same age education employer and work hours there is still a gap of 300kr 750usd per month studies by official statistical bureau of norway i am waiting for them to find the reasons for that.,1,NOT

prageru is not a university it is a media organisation i'm not being hyperbolic it literally isn't a tertiary education institution and notice how the presenter didn't actually name any of the studies cited the first was referred to as a study by the american association of university women and the second was a nameless paper by the u.s department of labor a reluctance to name or link to studies in the description usually points towards cherry-picking information that suits your argument i don't know very much about gender pay disparity but i'm going to look for a more reliable source to help me figure it out.,1,NOT

although i'm a total left winger i enjoy listening to prageru because at least they say it in an intelligent way and it forces me to develop a smarter rebuttal if i can't then i tend to agree with it the problem with people now days is that people only listen to what they want to hear and become very polarized i recommend watching vox videos if you are willing to do the same as me i'm sure right wing media makes the left wing sound stupid and vise versa but you look at educated thoughts on both sides neither sound as stupid.,1,NOT

you can't work fewer hours more predictable schedules less dangerous jobs pursue lower paying careers sacrifice more time for children or other aesthetic reasons etc and still expect to be paid the same as a man who sacrifices family spends more time at work pursues more dangerous higher paying jobs is able to focus long stretches of time at career and spends less time with family remember women have higher rates of depression and suicide in similar careers as men that proves they're biologically less likely to pursue higher paying careers.,1,NOT

so your last argument after taking in variables it will vanish to almost nothing is that without any study or verification you are just implying that it will vanish that is blatant hypocrisy you know first you manipulate data and say women just take lower paying job by enforcing sexist values throughout families and then you just assume what the hell is that you yourself said that it shrinks down to . to peecent why not a zero percent? you just assume that small wage gap is not important let's do a fun maths game if every american male earns 00 dollar for hour and a woman is paid percent less taking your generous average then she is just paid 4 dollars now that  dollars might not seems much but then it gives a decent fast food meal to fill your stomach once and that is important to many lower classes now if you multiply the hours worked by both the genders by  hours approx a five day to work week it compounds to 10 dollars and then if you multiply it to week month that is 7 hours..then the wage compounds to 10 dollars now that is a lot okay that is enough to make you survive comfortably in a middle class home for at least a week now it seems you are bad at maths not just the corporations and yeah i might have forgotten to take some data points into account,1,NOT

i went to a seminar on wage negotiation it was mostly geared towards women and i was one of the only two men that showed up they explained that another big issue is that most women don't negotiate their wages where most men will that a lot of women either don't know they can negotiate their pay or don't think their in a position too they did say that some companies have tried to take advantage of that by typically offering a woman less than they would a man on the hopes she wont negotiate it.,1,NOT
i think some of the gap can be down to how well men women negotiate i have a totally awesome strong female friend who recently negotiated salary for a new position and she just couldn't push hard on the salary the employer played it down in the range and my friend took the middle ground her skills are awesome and she's an absolute dream asset in her field but she just wouldn't push for the top end money i think guys are more likely to do that.,1,NOT

"this video proved to me that there is a gender wage gap in the example of the georgetown university top paying majors and least paying majors the out of the top paying majors dominated by women was pharmaceutical science and out of lowest paying majors dominated by women were counseling and psychology early childhood education human services and community organization and social work i think one of the variables that needs to be taken into account is a female's natural aptitudes and their value to society for example the history of stenography and secretarial work demonstrates the history of how a once male-only profession became available to women but at the cost of lower pay because they could secretarial work and stenography was only a male profession colleges that taught these subjects only admitted males historically this is the recent past if you go far back in history the work of scribes a once highly honored position was also the work of males from the book out of the kitchen and into the office by lynn peril a case history of poaching jobs from men unlike typing stenography had a long history of male practitioners in 906 the author of starting in life what each calling offers ambitious boys and young men warned his readers that save for the as yet mostly male bastion of the newspaper office the woman stenographer had become an office fixture and necessity. women had even infiltrated the ranks of court reports where they had been long considered too delicate to hear the litany of greed murder lust and corruption not to mention the occasional indecency of language they might be subjected to when taking trial testimony the reason for women's success as stenographers was obvious, the author concluded so long as the woman continues to work at a lower price than is paid to the man for a similar service the man cannot compete with the woman on what may be assumed to be the woman's ground. he thus warned boys to pause and reflect and then to pause again and to continue to reflect for several days or weeks before entering a profession which has comparatively few prizes to offer and has very little substantial reward even for those who draw a prize. the women it seemed had devalued what once had been a man's noble calling. i hope the above provides a good example of how women's work has been devalued historically and why i as a medical transcriptionist for  years with a 0-year work history in the field of just secretarial work am presently paid the same wages as a garbage truck driver would make at the start of his career if it was up to choice why would i not have chosen to be a garbage truck driver could it possibly be because of the strength requirements i.e. a male's natural aptitude?",1,NOT
this video misses the point ok men do work in jobs that pay more and sometimes this is due to danger or time worked but it doesn't explain why a skilled but feminised profession like nursing which is both skilled and difficult pays fast food wages looking at the caring professions in general even skilled and important ones such as day care social work and nursing) professions which women gravitate to and.... by coincidence they all pay low?? the argument that businesses would employ women if it were true?? wtf try and find  women oil rig workers.....or plumbers.....or engineers stooopid argument but industry happily does underpay in the professions that women prefer too complex to work out the reason nah!! in the past when women started working and moved into these fields men payed the wages and undervalued their work the present situation is a result of the past so we can say that the reason for this difference is complex which it probably is or acknowledge that it is unfair regardless of how complex the reason for the present factual situation is and rather than forcing women to move into jobs they might not care for pay them fairly where they predominantly can be found!! lastly i'm a guy....i don't believe in the premise that this is all down to toxic masculinity but i'm also not going to deny what is right in front of me my sister is skilled and works with brain damaged adults getting payed  dollars an hour.....i work as a night attendant at a university opening and closing doors requiring no skill or care)....i get  dollars.....happy i don't care.....and thus get payed a living wage!,1,NOT

it seems the two sides are talking past each other again even after explaining why the gender gap is there is clearly still a conversation to be had why is this the case that women are making these choices to be less prosperous then men and what role socialization has to do with it this problem however is a whole different problem from the original idea of women being paid less for the same work and has different implications still running back to the . wage gap buzzphrase is irresponsible and really the words coming out of peoples mouths should be more something along the lines of women are living less prosperously and ambitiously then men what could the implications of this be?‚Äù,1,NOT
this lady also forgot to mention occupational segregation. occupational segregation is seen in trends when people hold what were once considered stereotypically gendered jobs like women being nurses and men being doctors the previously male-dominated jobs continue to pay more and the traditionally female-track jobs tend to pay less to this day.,1,NOT

the real problem with women in the work force is there are stigmas against women doing certain jobs and some male and even female employers would rather hire a man thinking he'd do a better job this happens less and less year after year as less and less we are told to pursue careers that are for girls or for boys so there is an issue but it's not the lack of equal pay for equal work,1,NOT

my friend tried to debate me on this she believes all this stuff about the wage gap but when i tried to explain to her that the statistics don't account for different jobs she said no women get paid less for working the same job‚Äù i asked her what specific jobs she meant then and she said the jobs they do studies on‚Äù that drove me nuts you can't just read a study and not even look at where they got the information like seriously what do people think happen that women just get handed a  cent check at subway after their shift and men get handed a dollar you can't pay people differently just based on their gender anyways i should show her this video.,1,NOT
i love these videos thank you prageru for opening my mind.,1,NOT

if men truly did make 3 more than women then that would be a truly raw deal for men  men die on the job  times more than women  men are  times more likely to work two jobs and work over time  men have a much much higher injury rate and burn out rate  men have less perks a lot of companies don't have paternity leave  men by far work more dangerous jobs and more remote jobs  men see their families far less  men are the vast majority of combat deaths and for all that men only get 3 more its should be or times more now if the gov forces salaries to be equal then its clearly men who get screwed yes when we hear  women and  men died in a coal mine accident then talk about equality until then men are screwed.,1,NOT
would be nice to see the source for the papers that are mentioned in the video a quick google search didn't help me.,1,NOT

i've operated consulted for and owned various businesses like most entrepreneurs administrators consultants and executive my focus was hiring persons who were smarter than i was less for me to do and maximizing profits if i could have hired women and paid them less than men for the same job i would never have hired men the fact that men have these overpaid jobs and are even hired is contrary to any bottom-line consideration and that is the big lie in all this.,1,NOT
who would expect a conservative group to consider every fact right me neither all the arguments that try to explain why there isn't any wage gap miss out one thing of course you know that but you constantly manage to ignore it women have to give birth and therefore  need a stable environment  can't just be available 4/  can't just move around the world as firms want them to i consider a loving father to say the same things but as workers need to get more flexible because the companies are outsourcing their risk to the employees men have to addict to such injustices the real problem is the worker unfriendly workplace,1,NOT
i have been tortured for  years by the same old tired arguments of gender pay differences my career was in graphic design advertising in nyc where my skills and education so far outpaced those of my peers both male and female) that the real joke is why did i remain in that profession nonetheless in summary i encountered example after example company after company where in general females were paid more than males go figure.,1,NOT

did you make this video to test the conservative point of view i've been in the work force for  years and yes there's a gender wage gap to use an argument such as men are willing to be on call at all times etc is why they're paid more is not valid women who work the same long hours and are available at all hours get paid less period companies wouldn't hire just women to save the 5 because they still believe men can do a better job even if it costs more.,1,NOT

"2,02 feminists disliked this video.",1,NOT
i mostly agree with this video although i think there are some things one still has to consider as you mentioned there still is a wage gap between men and women for the same work which you explained as being the cause of men being more willing to do long hours but why is that biological differences between men and women aren't that big so that they would allow us to say that the reason is biological no it's the way how men and women are raised differently in our society that's also the reason why most women work in lower paid jobs as you mentioned at the beginning because we raise them to work in these jobs that's the core of the whole gender wage gap discussion.,1,NOT
no that's not how it works these are all reliable facts but these have all been already considered it's still true that women often earn less for the exact same work over the exact same time instead watching stupid videos on youtube that actually have a right-winged agenda you should inform yourself properly.,1,NOT
i clicked this thinking you was that dr sham guy or whatever,1,NOT
you work at the same job but do you work as a manager with a good education background and for  hours a day no then don't complain you make 7 cents less! now go make me a sandwich.,3,NOT

here in germany at my university there was a whole day dedicated to the gender wage gap and all those mindless drones spewed out the same nonsense and when you tried to debate them they kept yapping circular arguments .-,1,NOT
and let me ask why is it that best paid jobs are dominated by males and worst paid jobs by females i mean as a scientist arguing that there are so so soooo many variables i can't handle them all doesn't mean the correlation isn't real there's a wage gap as tiny as you want it to be) and there's a clear difference in how jobs are distributed there's also a habit from males to work longer hours or night shifts while women won't these are all correlations telling you something you can't deny their existence and that's why we are all saying there's sexism involved the reason behind sexism well we have to figure it out that's science awful video really.,1,NOT
women complaining that they get paid less than men is like tall people complaining that santa claus only hires midgets to work for him in the north pole.,1,NOT

this is amusing they should do this study at walmart where i get paid 11.7 an hour ft and am expected to train men they hire at 1 an hour to do the exact same jobü§î,1,NOT
you know i am not a fan of what every single thing feminist say but there is a wag gap it is a fact that the wage gap exist it just is a fact the wage gap and if you talk to people who understand the wage gap they will tell you this takes into consideration or account different choices men and women make such as job position total hours worked also number of children and the frequency at which unpaid leave is taken in addition to other factors they do take into account the type of degree one receives in college every feminist knows this but what feminist also bring up that people hate hearing which is a real factor that exist is discrimination which accounts for 0 of the wage gap according to the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the u.s has the 2th largest gender pay gap overall and the gap in this country is bigger than the gap in most european countries the economic policy institute says in simple terms no matter how you measure it there is a gap. also the reason women make the choices they do get the college degrees they do could be the result of a sexist culture maybe not saying that is the case.,1,NOT
the wage gap is there people just didn't do there research on the company if you didn't know this is isn't a place to be getting information from,1,NOT

she makes a lot of sense until she reaches the point where she tries to explain the .  gap by citing an example of a different variable other than gender and then somehow feeling satisfied that this means that the gender pay gap is basically non-existent why does she need to take the complete opposite side of the argument and say that the gender wage gap doesn't exist at all why can't she concede that it's possible that gender accounts for a non-insignificant part of the .6 unexplained gap?,1,NOT
"can't agree with more audi made a 01 super bowl commercial regarding this gender wage gap issue"" i decided to boycott audi after watching it i can't do much but i do what i can to show my disagreement with their lie.",1,NOT
i personally think that a good portion of the actual wage gap comes from men being more aggressive when it comes to requesting raises and are willing to over compensate when wanting the raise my wife for one was fine with just being a crew member i encouraged her to work harder and show her employers that she is worth more than what they are paying her within months she was offered shift lead and i continued to boost her confidence and pushed her to stay on top of things giving her advice on how to prove herself she pushed and worked harder she out shined most of her co workers with in a year she was made management i helped her develop the tools needed to excel and succeed in the job she liked i encourage her and stand behind her whenever she feels that she isn't doing good enough and help her reach the stars because she means so much to me and i can see that her success makes her happy she never would have accomplished so much with out a man's outlook to guide her not saying she would have eventually gotten the position on her own but she would have taken much much longer the way she was handling it she is strong without me but she is even stronger with me we are partners and she outshines me now and i am so proud of her.,1,NOT

or we should pay them both equally so whoever wants to stay home can stay home and have the job they want to someone want stay home and have kids that's great for them somebody else wants to go to work men women it doesn't matter we should treat them like human beings with dignity and respect,1,NOT
i'm only acquainted with the statistics in sweden where the unexplained wage gap is .6% i think the last point of this video where men in average work longer hours in full time jobs is a factor that should be looked at more according to last year's report by scb men work an average of  minutes more per week.,1,NOT
finally the bulk of child care even within in a marriage is still traditionally placed on the women in the partnership and not the man although as women outperform men in college education see another prager u essay perhaps more men will stay at home with the children and work the less demanding jobs.,1,NOT
i know that i am being kind of picky here but median is not the average median is just the number that appears in the stats and is not the average in many cases mean is the average just saying again i know that i sound picky for saying this but i just like math a lot and don't want even a small risk of people getting confused there are a lot of idiots online.,1,NOT
i had to get into a discussion about this with peers and let me tell you when i said that it's a myth that got pissed their line i did the research and that it's  pages long and all i asked was what businesses make a wage gap and i almost got hit after class it was hilarious.,1,NOT
wow this is simply not truth and yes we know why there is this 6.6 gap there are thousands of studies proving that if men were taking care of every single activity that women are expected to do outside their professional activities like working at home cleaning or taking care of kids) women simply could take these men jobs and earn more because there are no naturally men jobs this is not simply a math issue but a gender gap in social responsibilities between women and men and this is science not a myth or any math error by spreading these messages you show a clear ideological point of view and not a scientific one as you want is to believe.,1,NOT

‚Äúif men make more money than women then why don't businesses just hire all women? because that's not how ceos negotiate pay...at all how little a boss pays their employees is based on what they can get away with while negotiating wages there is a reason why employees are discouraged from discussing their salaries with one another it's to keep pay negotiations in favor of the boss and in a hypothetical environment such as an office building with more men in it than women you can get away with paying women a lower salary by making it difficult to compare her earnings with other employees.,1,NOT

she sounds like a toddler that just started talking about trans people....she just sounds confused ,3,NOT
"...i guess what makes people get negative the most is also the fact that she monetized all those videos including this last one today first one has two ads 2mil views aka at least -10k second one has three ads 1mil views aka around -5k and this last one has four ads which will no doubt reach a million views at least so all in all with those last three vids that's anywhere from 0k at the minimum to 0k+ all this in three days) that's why people amongst other things but mainly i feel took it as oh just another clickbait troll stunt from trisha the chicken nugget"" she is who she is and usually id tell her she doesn't need to explain anything but this time it def got icky somehow and she has to take serious action to rectify the damage she's done i think she should be demonetizing those videos or better donating all the money from them to the lgbtq community with proof despite all i truly believe she cares about this community and that she didn't intend anything bad....the only thing that could make me question that is her keeping that money i think she is just a very dependant person who absorbs the personality of whoever is in her life at that time and who then has an identity crisis when that person gets out of her life it's not necessarily a bad thing she could def turn this around be an award winning actress with what is originally a more negative personality traits lol) but the girl needs to go away for a while alone on a vacation and concentrate on finding herself once and for all but that's just my long opinion ",3,NOT

keep in mind though trisha paytas is one of the biggest trolls on youtube she intentionally makes up controversial bullshit to drive traffic to her channel and create disagreements and arguments in her comment sections she doesn't actually think she's trans she just wants ad revenue and knows people will click this video to tell her she's an idiot.,5,ABU

speaks facts and eats chick-fil-a if this isn't a modern queen idk what is.,2,NOT

oh shes a troll and meming,3,NOT
i'm with you on trisha not being trans and everything you said related to trans specifically but i don't understand the need to invalidate non-binary people.,3,NOT
i think she's being serious because she just seems like someone who would be that dumb and stupid to say something like that she seems really unstable and that this is either a coping mechanism or cry for attention or she's actually that confused either way if she is being serious i get that she might not always want to have to put the effort out to be the most beautiful woman ever but just because she doesn't like that does not make her trans lmao she need some milk,5,ABU
honestly if this isn't a troll then her ramblings sound like someone having an identity crisis someone that doesn't fit in anywhere and everyone is kind of against her no one really accepts her anywhere by her own fault of her trolling and being an idiot so she's trying to find something to explain her confusion with who she is and where she fits in the world again by the  chance she's not trolling.,5,ABU

totally agree with you blaire i am very fluid and indecisive about my gender expression as a kid one minute id be rolling around in mud playing with toy trucks and army soldiers the next id be covering myself in my mums makeup and doing fashion shows with my girlfriends at  not much has changed lmao these things dont make my gender any different ive just been raised in s household where it was encouraged to express yourself as long as it was safe and appropriate but i am 00 comfortable with the fact that i have boobs and a vagina i am a woman and a proud one im very assertive and dominant in situations but i fully identify with being a woman ive had some of my leftist friends try to say that im trans or genderfluid who couldn't accept the fact that i am a woman these are the same people that advocate for womans rights and preach that you can be masculine and androgynous and still be a woman and yet also preach sexist stereotypes to indicate that you are one gender or the other like bitch?!?!? im so confused???,2,NOT
these community just full of gender stereotype pink blue pastel dark red whatever it just color just like whatever you like it have nothing to do with trans make up or not it doesn't making you be more or less girl we just dress whatever we want to feels good and comfortable about ourselves as much as how furry can't turned to be real fox from what they wear or not wear you are not gonna be more or less female just from make up too it just what you choose to wear making you feels good i'm a girl i love blaire but that still doesn't make me trans i just think she's so hot! my sis love gays and want to be gay but that's just her fetish of yaoi i guess just being who you are love yourself wear whatever you want but if you want to cut your boobs well.. then you maybe trans,2,NOT

i don't wanna judge but since i know they're not gonna see it and it was bugging me for a long time i'm gonna say it i think my friend became a trans man because of his fetish for gay men even before he came out as a guy i would constantly see and hear him talk about all the gay guy he like however me as a lesbian cis woman whenever i wanted to talk about my crushes on girls he would stop listening to me or even say how gross and weird that is woman with a woman gross from supposedly gay guy wow.,1,NOT

i would fuck this disgusting mess of a being maybe off myself after but i'll deal with that bridge when i come,6,ABU
i'm a transgender female trisha is notorious for being a troll it's hard to believe her her reasoning for being trans is absolutely wack if she wants to be trans no one has an issue with that but i have no clue if this is a troll,3,NOT
so she's clearly nuts and is extraordinarily unbalanced mentally with all of these little admissions of her's that much is obvious looks like a woman acts like some women thinks like some women.. clearly a woman and she even knows she was born female has female biology and everything outward indicates an identification with this.. but thinks she transsexual but also or has in the past thinks she's.. you know what it doesn't even matter you get a person saying certain things out loud and they just lose all credibility the chances of a person coming back from that and ever mentally being capable of handling more or being more are slim-to-none she's not ever going to get more intelligent she was an idiot then and is still clearly an idiot now this is the problem with insular thinking particularly when you're not even remotely intelligent or capable of honest self-analysis or self-awareness you think stupid things for terrible or non-reasons and then you start to believe them because this stuff never came out of your mouth in the presence of intelligent honest critical people if it ever did at all trisha was never set straight and had it explained to her why she is wrong and will likely never be right for the rest of her existence best case scenario she's a troll that thinks this is somehow a good idea and that just makes her an asshole and an idiot worst case scenario she actually thinks this way and she's many neurons short a coherent thought and she's a different kind of idiot why are the available options never good all that saved me in this video was blaire blaire and that adorable nose-scratch she did.,5,ABU
i mean i def think non binary is a thing it just wasn't as ubiquitous until recently or it can be a safe stepping stone for some people on the journey to discover how they want to present and live their life that being said trisha doesn't seem to really understand what it means to be trans or what it means to be non-binary but that's just my opinion,2,NOT

gigi's video was.. well hmm confusing because her end conclusion was how we have to accept trisha's assertion and therefore fight against ignorance while she ignored every ignorant thing trisha said like how trisha identified as trans because she wanted male privilege while still identifying with her birth gender that seems like the kind of ignorance hypocrisy? that gigi might want to poke at just a bit.,2,NOT

umm....ok this is stupid why did i get this ad,1,NOT
where is the sauce tho,2,NOT
why do they never link the damn sources...,1,NOT
delete this video.,2,NOT
men shop themselves around more often especially early in their career women are far more likely to stay i their first job for longer while men are more likely to check the help wanted sections or hire a headhunter to try to find a higher paying job men are also more likely to ask for bigger raises at the end of the year the company isn't going to just give you a big raise every year if you don't ask. when you compare men and women with similar everything...similar education similar years experience and a similar philosophy on work either both men and women who shop themselves around and change jobs frequently or both men and women who are content with their first job then the wage gap disappears entirely in fact then women get a few cents more.,2,NOT
can you please cite your information in the description of your videos thank you i want to believe you but if you don't cite your sources it's hard for me to take it as fact.,1,NOT
sending this to my mum.,1,NOT
men work harder and longer so they earn more many but feminists call this sexist ,2,NOT
ah my daily dose of logic and reasoning for the day ,2,NOT
uhh no the facts you showed actually revealed that the male dominance of the high paying jobs which happens because the society and our culture encourage boys about having such job a lot more than girls creating the wage gap.(no it's not because boys are better at stem the science itself already proved that girls are just as good as boys at math and science and etc. also since our businesses were run by mostly males since the beginning of the word business the culture actually is more fit to men which also is the big reason of the wage gap women are discriminated just look at the facts,1,NOT
they say women are oppressed one minute then say women don't exist and there are really 6 genders another.,3,NOT
i disagree i know a true real life example of a wage gap i know a professor who got a job in a southern college and was paid less than her husband who was hired a year later he has less education and less experience than she does and yet she was told that he earns more because he is head of the home and that they both receive the money so why does it matter how each of them get paid they quit and got a job at a college in the north instead she now gets paid more since she works harder than her husband and has more education and experience.,1,NOT
the reason why they dont hire women in critical position is because they do not know how to make critical decisions never hire a women.,5,ABU
mrs summers you shouldn't wear so much makeup,3,NOT
the wage gap is real but it's only like -8% and it hasn't been proven to be an act of discrimination.,2,NOT
what kind of character does someone have who dislikes this video good video though,2,NOT
while the problem is actually different than the one advertised it is a problem nonetheless encouraging women to choose the higher paying careers needs to take place as does increasing the wage for the lowest paying careers.,1,NOT

title there is no gender wage gap goes on to talk about how there is in fact a gender wage gap but don't worry if you make good choices then you can shrink it all the way down to a . cent difference which essentially means that even if you play your cards right you will be paid . percent less if you're a woman than if you're a man also want to point out how this lady goes and talks in a video about how bad boys are doing in school and getting worse grades than girls mainly because they spend too much time outside and therefore we need to change the system so that it can benefit them basically when it comes to girls it's their job to adjust their choices to adapt to a system clearly built against them but when it comes to boys it's the opposite since even though their poor performance in school is solely due to their own decisions we must change the system to benefit them yeah these guys basically just tell right-wing people what they want to hear friendly reminder that prager u is predominately funded by an oil tycoon and then comes out with a video called why you should love fossil fuels.‚Äù,2,NOT

this intro is kind of dumb the reason businesses don't only hire women is because ) the women will know that they are being paid less than if a man worked there and that's incredibly disrespectful  if a business hired only women men would be absolutely pissed and boycott all of the businesses and they would lose money before watching the whole video i believed in the wage gap now that i have other statistics i dont other than the fact that the information is dated its a good video!,2,NOT
200 butthurt feminists who deny facts disliked this video,2,NOT
i wondered how they calculated the wage gap but if they do it that way it's not proving except that men earn more on average feel like showing this to my form tutor who always goes on bashing about men and how we're the bain of all evil,2,NOT
the thing i dislike about these videos is the fact they name a source such as the us department of labor studies and use it to prove choice is to blame and don't link it anywhere in their videos.,1,NOT
but isn't that the point of the wage gap to show that there is an overall difference in compensation yes of course that is not because some evil managers want to pay less money but because of personal choices which are a direct product of influences from our society there is a wage gap though it is not a matter of paying more or less but of a social issue that makes woman and men tend to different carreer choices i guess some people manipulate everything it's just a shamr because the concept behind it is nice and would help both woman and men.,2,NOT

so many angry woman screaming at their screens right now.,3,NOT
i thought about this for a min in particular the first question especially bc this logic would then apply to other wage-gaps whether it ethnicity disabilities age and even something as small as employee physical appearance tall attractive people are statistically paid more so why not hire only short ugly people the reason is people inherently believe that the short ugly female etc person is worse at their jobs and deserves less pay or much more often they believe that the tall attractive white male will do a better job and therefore deserves more basically favouritism so to put it another way the first question implies that the hiring manager knows that a man and woman will perform the same task to the same ability but in reality prejudices impact how they perceive someone completing a task so the hiring manager will believe a white man will and does perform the job better and deserve more compensation.,2,NOT

facts are mostly correct but the main question remains why are those choices what women choose it's because society doesn't provide a level playing field for women the expectation especially from the right is that women should take care of the children and thus make all the sacrifices.,5,ABU

great video annoying comments stopping bashing each other geez,2,NOT
i'm confused doesn't this help prove that there is a gender wage gap precisely because men are in the high paying fields such as engineering and computer science while women are in more low paying fields such as education and social work yes it is each individuals choice to be in those fields but only because our society encourages them to go into those fields and still sets women up as the carers and teachers while setting men up as the brainiacs and scientists or athletes most of us don't do this on purpose but we all do it indirectly by supporting gender traditions like barbie vs hot wheels or the wife taking the last name of the husband and we have gender traditions for the worforce too for example picture an airline pilot and a flight attendant i always picture the pilot to be male and the flight attendant to be female same for me goes with chef/server doctor/nurse manager/receptionist i always thought this is what was meant by the gender wage gap which this video proved to be true not that companies are so sexist they literally pay men more than women to say that so many women choose these caretaker jobs over men and that so many men choose these intellectual jobs over women is all based on each individuals choice seems to be ignoring our gender defining culture right now we are still a fairly sexist society wouldn't that affect everything especially the workforce?,2,NOT

this video is misinformed and misconstrues a georgetown study titled women can't win despite making educational gains and pursuing high-wage majors women still earn less than men to manipulate its audience one main finding of the study is discrimination even when women do everything right‚Äù‚Äîchoose a high-paying field of study pursue a high-paying major within that field and get a job in a high-paying occupation‚Äîwomen still get paid less than their male peers if a man and woman who are equally qualified get the same job the woman still only earns  cents for every dollar the man is paid‚Äîmore than 1cents to be sure but a far cry from earnings equality. to not include this principal finding of the  page study is disrespectful to the truth of the gender wage gap which might not be that every woman earns  cents to every dollar a man earns but it still exists at a cent deficit according to the sited georgetown study shame to prageru for disrespecting the truth and mission of this study spreading factually incorrect data with conviction and manipulating its millions of viewers.,1,NOT
sorry but i have to point out a mathematical error in this video starting about  seconds in the math is explained as the median earnings of all women working full time divided by the media earnings of all men working full time but then you give an example talking about the average income average and median are not the same thing in fact they can be very different.,2,NOT

i won't be speaking in favour or against the wage gap argument but the methods used to compare whether there is a wage gap or no is idiotic at best it's common sense to not use averages how about you take two people of the same profession working the same job in the same company with the only difference being their gender and see how much they earn per hour and not the total wage per month and then repeat that process over and over again with different jobs and companies only then can someone say whether the wage gap is still present or no.,1,NOT

the gender wage gap is foolish you get paid for what you do just because you are a female doesn't mean you can do easy jobs and expect a high wage most of the people who take risk and toil hard are men as i know most of the women get promoted easily regardless of how they work i have seen males work so hard fighting hard to get promoted but this woman deserves greater credit.,2,NOT
"when evidence contradicts your theory your theory is wrong as the video acknowledges there is a pay gap an australian study of over ,00 occupations showed that women earn more than men in only one high-paying job in australia and that women only out earned men in jobs that were low paid anyway data from australian tax office) as the australian study found there is no such thing as a job where women are taking home large pay packets but men are not‚Äù the median income for jobs favouring men was up to eleven times higher than the median income for jobs favouring women and it does make a fundamentally flawed assumption that corporations do the hiring they dont individual managers make hiring decisions and rarely are their incentives aligned with corporate objectives a corporation may claim equality but individual managers have to handle staff absences when women are off having children consciously and sub consciously there is an incentive to hire and promote men and thus pay women less to discourage them from accepting a role the final flawed logic is that we cant explain why there is a discrepancy therefore we cant claim that there is one‚Äù the claim was that women were paid less and the data shows that this is true whether or not one can explain the reason if police used that logic they would never investigate murders because they cant explain how it happened therefore they cant be certain that it did happen",1,NOT
women chose to make less money got it!,2,NOT
i agree with this but is it common sense that someone who works a reasonable expected amount of hours recieves less pay and chance of promotion than someone who works any shifts asked i know they're being paid for extra work but some people want a stable life work balance maybe they have a family why should they be punished for doing the regular expected shift just interested in peoples opinions i don't know the answer myself so don't rant at me,1,NOT
i am sry but this video isnt abou facts u started well but if u come to the question why more men are in higher well payed positions u just say individuell carreer choices would be important to get some statistics about how many women tried to get the job or would work harder/longer or longer to get it.,1,NOT

this video provoked me so much the wege gap is 00 about sexism women-dominated professions are lower paid than male-dominating professions even in a scenario where both jobs requires a university degree and the same dedication and hours spent at work the thing about that men are willing to work more hours relocate etc depends only by the fact that they are not expected by society to take equal responsibility for children and household work women for example have far more parental days and are expected to stay at home when the child is sick for example of course this will ultimately bring the woman less money this is not a choice it is a patriarchal structure.,1,NOT

also don't forget different employers pay differently...,2,NOT
i don't want to look weird but.. in the end the man and the woman are part of the same body you can't do with a leg what you can do with hand and vice versa sometimes its possible but generally if not always one is more efficient than the other depending the case i do not like stereotypes but maybe unconsciously for example a man is stronger physical than a woman however a woman is better when there its about communications anyway i believe that maybe it would be a good idea for everybody if we tried to make a better use of our qualities than trying to balance everything.,1,NOT

my female high school ap statistics teacher once and a couple other times told us it's not men who oppress women in the workplace but other women women are so jealous/competitive with each other that they would bring down other women so that they can get ahead it's an interesting thought to say the least of course i'm not generalizing for the entire population but it's another perspective to consider.,2,NOT
were the scientists who composed this wage gap study undergrads or something?,3,NOT
as a liberal/socialist i have to say that this video completely changed my opinion on the gender wage gap while i still think that a certain degree of sexism might be involved i.e some stem jobs are seen as male-only jobs reducing the number of female graduates) i admit that i was wrong.,2,NOT

the wage gap is that men don't cost as much to employ as women and there is no wage gap feminazis just hate men,3,NOT
wow you disproved this strawman that totally hadn't been destroyed earlier by anyone else why do women have worse occupations positions education and work less hours gender roles.,2,NOT

i'm in love with this woman.,2,NOT
nope too much logic.,3,NOT
even the incorrectly calculated wage gap is closing fast way more women go to college than men and women are getting married and having kids later and later every year to focus on their careers more the truth is business was extremely unfriendly to women like  years ago and it's been getting progressively better since then one day women will probably make more than guys do the way the education system is going but these things take time they don't happen overnight.,2,NOT
the reason this question is much more controversial than it should be is because of this is there a gender gap yes this is a 00 undeniable truth and we have the statistics to back it up men do earn more than women this is the reality but the controversy is not about the fact that it exists but the reason to it and as the video clearly states this gap exist more due to the career choices men and women make than an evil men conspiracy there will always be a gender gap and sometimes it will swing in one way and sometimes another because we are all individuals are women stupid for choosing a career they enjoy no women tend to work to live while men tend to live to work and that makes the women far more intelligent in my book that said would love to see more women in my field embedded programming).. ),2,NOT

can you please translate this to greek i want to show it to my classmates..:),2,NOT
why do female fashion models earn much more than male models is that reverse sexism the clothing/fashion/hair/makeup/fragrance industries are obviously able to get a higher return on famous female models appearing in their marketing materials.,3,NOT
finally the truth about the perceived wage gap.,2,NOT
you make what you earn not sure of an occupation that guys couldnt focus on that isnt male dominated that men if ok by society couldnt pgwn but i cant think of one that women could own for just being women but yet many jobs men could do and own women such at it if men do it name one you cunts... name one job men cant do better than y0u,5,ABU
so funny about all these rah rah comments  none of you all give a sh*t that women earn so little you're like who cares if their full time jobs don't earn sh*t it's their choice to teach our kids maybe get shot) wipe our grandpa's butts help get the homeless drug treatment shelter stay home a while with a man's children suckers. are your values all about the market?,2,NOT

let's say i own a business i know hiring is an imperfect science and that i will invariably hire employees who aren't right for the job the fact that i might be sued for being racist or sexist if i hire a black person or a woman is going to make me only hire white guys not because i am racist or sexist but because those are the only employees who i can easily fire if they aren't doing a good job has anyone ever thought how affirmative action and special protections for certain groups ends up helping white guys wouldn't it be better to simply have equal opportunity,2,NOT

the . cents gap can also relate to maternity leave from the job the wage gap is that a myth it was outlawed in 963.,2,NOT
yes i'm a feminist and i realise that the wage gap is highly exaggerated in the us and other first-world countries but that doesn't mean that feminism is bad perhaps the extremists but not at the core of it) or that gender inequality has been fixed developing countries have a huge gender inequality in literacy schooling/education work and relationships there has been so much progress made by the movement which is why we should keep the name feminism to respect and acknowledge the history and achievements made by some incredible people and groups) but there's still so much progress to be made please don't harass people who use the word feminism or people who don't get all their facts right harassment does not educate people or allow for conversation can we instead be open-minded kind and ready for compassionate discussion?,1,NOT
i checked aauw website there is lots of articles about pay gap but how will i find data that is mentioned on :14?,1,NOT
it makes it more believable when a woman is saying this stuff,2,NOT
i'm glad that was clarified!,2,NOT
so nice to see something based on facts and not on the media lying to us and spreading rumours there is some hope in this world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2,NOT
so the case is that the entire concept of a gender wage-gap was established from a misinterpretation of a statistic regaring average salary of men and women and some people came to the conclusion that this difference in average salary must be because of discrimination when it's really because of differences between how males and females think/choose men on average tend to go for the higher-paying jobs and work longer very interesting.,3,NOT
this is a very misleading video and clearly has a lot of the people in the comments confused first off the title of this video is clearly wrong within the video it states that there is a wage gap but that it is produced by choice from this position you must then ask why women are choosing lower paid jobs there are multiple answers to this firstly the patriarchal society in which we live has tended to pay male dominated industries more this is not necessarily because these industries are of more value it is due to unions and wage debates over decades secondly women are told from a young age that they will be a nurse teacher or any other female dominated industry this is through all kinds of life also the idea that women should be the ones looking after a child are outdated this is a joint task for both parents.,1,NOT
this is such a great video you can not argue facts.,2,NOT
seems like a defeatist mindset. then there's all of those magical variables no one can define in the end the gap still exists either way which defeats the supposed premise of the video this one seems odd...,2,NOT
pharmaceutical sales aka pretty women selling men boner pills.,3,NOT
so the gender wage gap does exist but there are many variables and no apparent reason why,2,NOT
as the video demonstrated the wage gap does exist and is driven by the society valuing male dominated professions more as a business owner i do find that women often times agree to the lower salary compared to men.,2,NOT
yes this video is totally accurate and i agree with the whole idea but people saying that her first statement already destroys the myth does not make a lot of sense companies have a general idea that women aren't as valuable so they arent hired as much,2,NOT
because salaries are negotiated god damn that why don't businesses only hire women is so tired the issue is positions and occupations as well if you don't actually understand the issue maybe not talk about it and if there is no gap then a law requiring no gap would do nothing so it's a win win and if you argue against a win/win situation than that means you want someone to lose.,2,NOT

a sincere thank you for addressing this it's a kick in the goods to pseudo bias research the like of which should be utterly destroyed with fire and hatred.,2,NOT
i've long believe that this is a myth which is backed up by feelings rather than hard facts strange also that even when studies have shown cases where on a like for like basis women were earning more than men the psychotic feminists would still keep on habit i guess whining about women earning less than men oh and while we're on the subject how did the men ever allow the women in tennis to be paid the same as them for about / the work?,3,NOT
this makes some sense,2,NOT
id fuckthe shit outta that grandma,6,ABU
in my sociology class we were talking about gender inequality and my professor brought up the wage gap i asked why wouldn't businesses hire women in order for them to pay less and make more profit he answered in some bs that people at the top are sexist and that's the reason why all i ask for is one conservative professor.. just one.,2,NOT

if i had a dollar for everytime i could show this video to a feminist a woman would've made  cents,2,NOT
despite the actually narrow wage gap between men and women in western industrial societies there is still a tendency of women to call on traditional female privileges where in marriage the male was the sole breadwinner when they say to their spouses what's mine is mine and what's yours is ours. it makes a man want to go mgtow men going their own way) i could make an exception as christina hoff sommers would make an interesting date.,2,NOT
i wasnt buying this either but this video cleared everything up for me.,2,NOT
she didn't talk about the reason why women go into lesser paying jobs why do women choose these less paying jobs why don't more women choose higher paying jobs women want to work regular hours because they are usually caring for children...they have families it's not that they need to get to work‚Äù though i am compelled by the no wage gap argument there is still a stigma though less prominent than it has been about where a woman should be placed in society.,1,NOT
real good video i almost thought ben shapiro wrote the script,3,NOT
okay so you normalize for job title and years of experience but that's the problem men are much more likely to have roles in management and high paying job titles than women women are burdened with having to take care of children and work a full-time job at the same time while the majority of men can just focus solely on their career and be home just in time for dinner to be ready while not contributing much else to the household and i could bet you that my male coworker who has worked there less than i have gets paid more just because he has a masters degree next to his name and because he's a male even though i have much more work experience in total than he does because our indian boss comes from a culture where there is a huge bias of gender and education title.,2,NOT

even as a liberal i knew this was true you don't have to do much research to figure this out.,2,NOT
in my job as an executive director of a non-profit we pay men and women equally but women end up making less because they take more time off exceeding what we allow which means they aren't paid for it a couple women scream equal pay for equal work but i remind them that also means equal work for equal pay' if they aren't there to work they won't get paid for it unfortunately for women women take time off not only when they are sick but also when family members are sick or when someone in the family has a school consultation or school play or dr's or dentist's appointment one woman in the office would leave every day at :00pm an hour before everyone else because the bus would drop her kids off at school at that time when she complained about me docking her pay for that i explained that why would it be fair for me to pay her that hour when the others in the office were actually working to be paid i had suggested that she not take a lunch or come in early but those didn't work for her either i felt like she was lucky i let her go home early every day she felt like i was robbing her.,2,NOT
to funny men's hours are mostly logic based women's choices seem mostly emotional or irrational but men are the immature ones hahaha,3,NOT
if after factoring in choice the wage-gap shrinks to only . cents for every dollar that means that choice isn't responsible for a small wage-gap the . cents dollar is the result after accounting for choice this means that women are paid less on average some women are likely paid significantly less than male peers working the same jobs while in other companies women are on par with their coworkers yes a large component of the lager wage gap  cents for every dollar is due to job choice however it does not fully account for the wage gap and  cents to every dollar is still a significant gap.,2,NOT

this is the one video that makes sense on this channel the majority of the content on this channel has a strange culty vibe?,2,NOT
okay i'll honest here i thought there was a gender gap in wages but never dug into the matter as i'm only a student yet and it wasn't a present issue for me i did suspect there was some bias in the men's one dollar women's  cents statement and i'm glad i found this video because it confirmed my suspect and changed my overall opinion on the whole gender wage gap matter i'll dig into this more i just hope this video and her university are valid sources,2,NOT
it's a gender earnings gap most women earn less money than men but that doesn't fit the feminazi narrative so they'll just ignore it,2,NOT
lady you forgot to mention how women still lag behind their male coworkers by % rather than 2% after controlling for age education and years of experience and there's a 7 difference in total pay between men and women also when you separate income data by occupation the gender wage gap becomes even clearer the biggest gender wage gaps due to occupational segregation are seen in jobs located in business finance law and health-care occupations that are primarily self employed such as chiropractors the smallest wage gaps are seen in technology and science industries and health-care positions with a small degree of self-employment like pharmacists.,2,NOT
yes there is it is simple math,2,NOT
very well done! thank you!,2,NOT
warning this channel spreads climate skeptism and denial this is no university channel but a fraud the founder of this channel dennis prager is a religious fundamentalist and a republican politician in us clearly this man wants to spread the hatred of other religions misinformation against gender equality and basic climate science i have no doubt that this channel is funded by big corporations to spread lies and misinformation in people and thus make them weaker against their interests please do not share or spread the videos posted by this channel.,2,NOT

why don't youtube put prager u videos on top trending but keep promoting leftist hysterical nonsense.,2,NOT
this video actually states that the gender wage gap does exist it just says its ok it really annoys me when people don't understand that gender wage gap just means women on average get paid less than men not women who work at the same position as a man get paid less then men.,1,NOT
thank you we needed this video a long time ago,2,NOT
but muh communism but muh hillary but muh feminism but muh emotions facts make leftists sad.,3,NOT

these prager u vids are an enigma to me one can be a thoughtful fact-based argument there is no gender wage gap war on boys feminism .0 and the next can be an unfactual highly-opinionated rant dangerous people are teaching your kids everyone should stand for the national anthem) you guys definitely keep me guessing if nothing else.,2,NOT
it's a choice that men and women both make on call missing out on a lot in life dangerous work environment high risk of death or serious injury work long and late hours sacrificing time with loved ones and personal time for yourself no disrespect to women but 5 of them are not willing to do any of that but will complain their not getting paid as much as the person who is men don't do it because it's fun we do it because someone has to if you was a employer and had a employee working late hours on a short notice willing to be on call willing to come in on their days off willing to relocate and go out on dangerous work environments wouldn't you want to pay them a bit more then the person who isn't willing to do any of that?,3,NOT
it's odd that you never hear anyone ever talk about the fact that in the porn industry women actors are paid about ten times as much as men actors for doing the same job.,2,NOT
i do not care what the job huge salaries need raining in there are not enough hours in a day for any human being to genuinely earn hundreds of thousands of pounds in a salary its just greed to make them richer that the rest who are probably working ten times harder for a very very lot less.,2,NOT

man earns dollar female wtf i only earned  cents child you guys are getting paid for work?,3,NOT
an interesting problem is leaving the west e.g latin america what about the wage gap here i saw ads for a job that stated the monthly income and it was different for man/woman yes they had salary values i filled out myself a salary calculator and finally switched from male to female and rerun it the result was significant lower.,2,NOT
they do not hire only women for the same reason they pay women less than men sexism and prejudice they think that even with paying less for a female employee it would not be worth it they do not hire as many women to high positions because they think among other things than the underlings will not respect the authority of women or that women do not do as good of a job.,2,NOT
"0:0 :2 sexism maybe :3 :1 alright :1 :2 so there's some bias right there you made the bar say 7 cents when it should have said 23 cents or you could have made the bar say  cents and then say 93. cents"" i'm willing to forgive it but bias is something one shouldn't forget about :2 :3 that's one way to interpret it there is the idea that certain jobs are paid less because they are traditionally female and because women tend to gravitate towards them :5 may be that's the key term in that sentence :0 :0 see this is where the interesting part is do those jobs pay less because they're traditionally female the one job where women dominate men the second highest paying one i mean is still traditionally considered a male dominated job perhaps the pay for these jobs is low becuse they're traditionally female :0 okay so men are overrepresented in dangerous jobs but women are overrepresented in jobs which help the social classes and keep the country turning and people in need happy men are overrepresented in business jobs which pay too much and contribute little enough to society that if a few went out of business it wouldn't really effect most people in a major way women should be paid more for jobs like pshychology education human services and social work which is essential to our society.",2,NOT

"in my government and economics class i have a friend who is a feminist whenever she talks about the wage gap topic she brings up the fact that her mom who was a doctor was payed less than other doctors in the same field i don't remember what kind of doctor she was) i just couldn't agree with her with this example as her evidence i knew for a fact that there were way to many factors that went into an individuals pay for the reasoning to just be women aren't being treated equally"" im sure there are other true examples of inequality but they must be very rare and small cases that are also probably resolved quickly i don't see why people have to assume all the statistics correlate or have anything to do with each other they just show what's happening not how its happening.",2,NOT
there probably is a gender wage gap but i don't think it's a problem i'm sure it just happened to be this way and in a few years it'll go the other way.,2,NOT
the   difference can partially be explained by actual sexist small business owners who deliberately pay women less these would be few in number but nevertheless it gets counted when you look at averages.,2,NOT
you forgot about the wage gap between bunnies and humans,3,NOT
finally somebody admits it,2,NOT
"i agree with most of the stuff you said in the video but what if there was a huge wage gap on woman on a job?,my good friends mother is working full time as a journalist and is writing news paper for a work time of -1 hours a day i dont remember the paycheck that she needed to make but lets just say by working  hours she is going to make k)she is working like crazy for 0hours and she should make k right well right but the problem is her boss from k she is getting payed a lot less than she should about 200‚Ç¨ she is scared do ask her boss the reason that she gets a low payment because is a little bit hard to find a job in that city i dont know if her boss is sexist or an asshole or even both but that is a huge wage gap and indeed is happening in some reare cases.(i dont disagree with the video i just want to say that this happens some times and i got as a explaination my friends mother that is based on a reall story oh and sorry for my english ",2,NOT
i really want to show this to my teacher in school hes always talking about women being payed less and im tired of it,2,NOT
this video made me subscribe,2,NOT
221 triggered feminists disliked this video.,3,NOT
it's not just common sense but also reality.,2,NOT
its just a bandwagon for career politicians and militant feminists to leap on to.,2,NOT
w...w...what miss you do know your not meant to say this your a female your meant to hate men,3,NOT
this is the truth when are feminists going to get common sense one other thing why does the left talk about the gender wage gap so much and then pretend there is no difference between genders when it comes to the lgbt agenda hypocrisy.,3,NOT
there's a clever linguistics trick at around :15 she says the wage gap shrinks when we account for choice and then says the remaining .6 is due to choice that doesn't actually logically follow and the fact that such a blatant error made it through scripting performing and editing says that it was likely deliberate.,2,NOT
4. k feminist got b triggered by the truth,3,NOT
finally im not the only one who thinks the same,2,NOT
stick to this stuff you made some excellent points religion.. not your strength.,2,NOT
i can say there is hello im liliyanna im transgender and im a welder when i was male i was payed 25.5 hr as a woman i was offed 1 hr max this is the same job.,2,NOT
"coming from a libtard here as i know republicans call us good video wage gap is almost 00 a myth i would have liked to see an example of a specific job that a man and a woman share and their wages to solidify the argument but i'll just assume that that's where the .6 comes from i do have an issue with the tone of the video though i get that prageru's audience is more republican and conservative but the aggressive tone and use of words/phrases like myth and sexists don't have their math right are just unnecessary rude and alienate half of your potential audience the people who you might want to convince that they don't have their facts exactly right the numbers don't lie in this case economics is clearly more complicated than businesses pay them less because they're women, but an aggressive tone does more harm than good.",2,NOT
ooh this is gonna trigger so many feminists,3,NOT
1/2 men are expected to die in a work related accident each year but we don't care about that now do we lol.,2,NOT
i liked this video a month ago i came back today and found i had disliked it any answers youtube?,1,NOT
i went out of my way just to click this ad and thumbs up the video,2,NOT
i like that it's a women debunking this myth,2,NOT
i'm a leftist and i agree the gender wage gap is a myth ever since 96 it's been against the law to pay someone less because of their race or gender.,2,NOT
obama got away with this pandering lie because fake news doesn't care about truth.,5,ABU
hum sooo how it comes that every woman i know are less payed than men for the same job that means same task hours education etc...),2,NOT
now their argument is going to be woman are oppressed into choosing lower paying jobs because men are scary‚Äù,3,NOT
give woman right they said.. it'd be fun they said...,5,ABU
"""it's cos women are pushed towards low paying jobs this is what my teacher says i don't think she likes ys",2,NOT
if feminists took economics instead of gender studies maybe they'd know this,2,NOT
"show this to a feminist and they will be like:""yeah im sure they hold this woman hostage until she read the entire script of the video""",3,NOT
i will be the one to take loads of insults and thumbs downs on this but prager should not be using such an absolute title for this video their arguments are correct yes the popular  cents per dollar mantra is the result of statistical illiteracy but they are not addressing the fact that a wage gap indeed exists and can be shrunken by some means for example we could encourage women to pursue the hard sciences encourage better wage and salary negotiation and promote better work ethic saying that a small gap exists and is thus irrelevant is nonsense i expect better from prager.,2,NOT
how can there be a gender wage gap if gender is a social construct?,3,NOT
could you point me to where you found the aauw brought the gape down to .6% i'm searching but i cannot find it,1,NOT
"exactly and choices are made of totally free will hahahahahaha common... woman do not take more responsabilities to clean at home or be with kids.. for example... that takes their time for choosing more proffessional development.. why is this for free choice hahahahaa i had to totally quit my job as a university teacher because i choosed to have kids a man can both have the job and the family it is true than we choose but it isn't a free choice it's a social impossed one because of a gender gap watch the video of eh about the dream gap"" it also have to do with that i get sad that a woman is making this video:-(",2,NOT
the only ad i liked that i was forced to watch on youtube.,2,NOT
wow it's almost as if prageru is saying the exact same things as feminist theorists men are socially conditioned into higher paying work for no apparent reason ahhaha,3,NOT
so many people butt hurt because of a minute youtube video.,2,NOT
listen to the distant screeches of the special snowflakes as they sprint here as fast as their chubby legs can carry them.,3,NOT
i didnt know people still believed this myth,2,NOT
the womansplaining is so strong on this video,3,NOT
yes those calculations don't show education work or choice but there is data including those factors the gender wage gap does exist and i have overwhelming data to prove it go to the economic policy institute.,1,NOT
im a leftie but i do agree with this....,2,NOT
brilliant as always based mom.,2,NOT
why celebs are not making noise on the homeless issue why?,2,NOT
i think prager university should change its name to hard facts university melt all the little snowflakes into a puddle!,3,NOT
when will people learn?,2,NOT
heeeeerrrrrressss the triggered.............,3,NOT
"i'm no feminist but if you are going to present a proper argument you can't repeatedly twist facts with vague statements...1 why don't businesses hire only woman? because when i hire someone for a job there are literally  years worth of discrimination laws that prevent me from making my decision based on gender oh and your reproductive sex is not listed under qualifications  they don't take into account occupation no they only take into account literally all occupations held by both/either genders making it abundantly non-bias .""position are you reflecting on men holding higher payed positions illustrating a gender-based inequality because it sounds like you did  education people who attend a university will make on average million dollars more over  years and there are more woman than there are men in college so logically shouldn't education result in woman making more hours per week we literally just heard you mention both parties working full-time rendering that irrelevant to the statistic ....",1,NOT
didn't you already make this video?,2,NOT
holy shit you can't be serious!,2,NOT
that's the thing about common sense it's not as common as you might think.,2,NOT
men make more money because men care more about making money this isn't rocket science anyone that can't see this must be willfully ignorant men are not more materialistic but they absolutely care more about how much money they make and guess what that's fair the person that cares more and tries harder as a result should do better i know we love this idea of the mary sue characters like ray from star wars.. no practice no effort just instantly a master of whatever she tries to do that's not real life unfortunately the person that tries the hardest usually wins men care more about making money so they try harder to make money because they try harder guess what every decision that they make will be influenced by the desire to make more money and in the end they will likely out earn women stop trying to prove that women are better than men it's crazy annoying and it belies your inferiority complex.,3,NOT
i feel like feminist are always mad wage gap or no they will be mad there is none,3,NOT
this is one of the best videos i have ever seen i love this university.,2,NOT
i would say that the premise of this video is totally stupid but it isn't it's purposefully deceptive shame.,3,NOT
there is still a gender wage gap the video is very good the conclusion misses something however the best-paying specialties often require flexible hours in business for instance a high paying career is one that requires you to have a lot of meetings outside of your - routine given that women tend have more commitments at home than men they are not as free to shape their lives around their work like men so are there less women in high-paying jobs because they consciously dislike high-paying jobs and prefer lower-paying jobs no because we expect women to take care of the kids to make dinner to wash the clothes to take care of the house as a result men are more flexible than women as a result you wouldn't hire someone who can't be as commited and if you are expected to not be as commited you won't even consider these jobs this explains why in science and research careers for instance which don't require as much commitment outside of - hours women do just as well as men is it fair it's a different debate in my opinion yes it is see ya,2,NOT
prageru seems to be the only right wing college out there.,2,NOT
"""this isn't sexism its just common sense""",3,NOT
i think it's an issue that traditionally feminized and female-dominated fields like counselling nursing teaching are paid less than male-dominated fields like engineering and tech why do we pay teachers and counselors less when those feilds are just as if not more essential to society as stem jobs?,1,NOT
these calculations may not indicate a gender-wage injustice as you said given that men are more likely to go into stem fields which pay more notwithstanding proving that these are poor ways to measure gender wage gap doesn't prove that there isn't a gender wag gap a better way to measure this would be compare hourly wages of men and women in the same profession and have been working the same number of years ,1,NOT
dude you shouldn't make videos like this this is a highly controversial topic and may make many feminists very upset.,3,NOT
i think we should start looking into the intelligence gap for everyone you have to be stupid to believe in the gender wage gap there is no other explanation.,3,NOT
i've always worked at places where payment was exactly the same for everybody in the same ocupation never actually understood/believed this gap everyone keep talking about i agree a hundred percent with the video career choices makes all the diference in this matter i'm from brazil and at least here a company simple cannot pay different values to employees who do exactly the same job for the same time in the same place.,2,NOT
this woman is a genius!,1,NOT
no wonder this video has almost million views it's true af,2,NOT
i appreciate the additional video on this topic it saddens me that it's always falling on deaf ears as those who would benefit from learning the truth are just too willfully ignorant to take any opposing view into genuine consideration.,2,NOT
do we know many men/women apply to join each college are women rejected from some colleges and steered toward others or do women choose to focus more towards the social education/career p.s i'm all for this just figured its a fair question,2,NOT
pleeeaaase react to pewdiepie's new video!!!!,1,NOT

transgenders make me cringe,3,NOT

what about a transgender league?,3,NOT
funny how everyone is for it then this crap happens lol men are generally stronger/faster than females...it is science not sexism.,3,NOT
all those parnets just want there daughter on top instead of the transgender females.,2,NOT
"now its ok to mix,anything goes as long the lower class stay low ",2,NOT
some of these girls want to win college athletic scholarships is it fair that a transgender female take away that opportunity if it continues to happen then won't most female athletics be transgender females we say we want to allow transgender females all the rights but where are the rights of the biological females?,3,NOT
"this reporter says that medical research can't really identify the line were a competitive advantage might exist for transgender athletes of either gender"" well that is a lie.",3,NOT
wondering?? these are males who wear makeup and grow their hair long and act like a girl and bianca is not very bright winning metals is not something everyone can do so how your feel and winning a metal are completely different.,5,ABU
if they started hormones it's not a advantage they are taking hormones that will help them physically and mentally transform into young women i will never understand the disrespect of others people are just mad because they won i'm sure this wouldn't be a problem if they lost you want to win u have to practice stop being cry babies they are not men anymore they have started hormones to become a women there's no advantage and people need to face the facts u can't accept it quit the track team,1,NOT
what has the world come to men who think they're women and it's not their own fault cause it's a mental disability the state is humoring this at the expense of the other real girl's success,5,ABU
they can do what they want but not at the expense of the girls !!!!!,3,NOT
muh feelins boy is this country fukd ,3,NOT
how is this an issue in the first place lol?,3,NOT
this is disgusting as a female track runner i'm so upset you can't deny the facts that you are a man we will support your change of sex but it doesn't change the fact that you trans are physically stronger,5,ABU
the other side of it is this in texas a young transman was forced to compete as birthsex female this person was hormonally transitioned into a male and it's stupid and dishonest to say hormone therapy doesn't change your sex characteristics everything will change what you ended up with was the image of a young man with a young girl in a chokehold this young man had begged to compete against men and was not allowed they made him wrestle girls you can look at it and see it's wrong this is also very clearly wrong neither side has this right but i stand flatly in the truth that in the binary the conservative position is always always always patently more stupid.,3,NOT
what sick people....parents need a brain transplant these sound like boys,6,ABU

how do they have an advantage they're running,1,NOT
people keep wanting to put feelings first yes i understand you're a transgender girl and that's your gender identity but you must understand that there is an obvious biological advantage that comes with being biologically born male like the woman said in the video men produce a lot of testosterone which increases the production of red blood cells that absorbs more oxygen enables men to develop larger skeletal muscles and develop larger hearts these give men a larger aerobic advantage so no transgender girls who are biologically men cannot and should not be allowed to compete with cisgender girls because of the obvious unfairness.,5,ABU
i want crowder,2,NOT
pathetic cheats can't compete against men because there crap.,5,ABU
i love it when the left paints itself into a corner which is happening a lot these days.,3,NOT
no shit they won they're men regardless of what they think they are which is fine but if they are taking part in physical challenges how you identify shouldn't matter one fucking bit it is irrelevant they are men they should be competing against men or we should make a special trans olympics if necessary.,5,ABU
there are two genders you are born male or you are born female....period.,3,NOT
the fact that the parents or the transgender girls don't see as this to be unfair is the real problem but we all know that if they were actually on the mens team we probably wouldn't even know who they are they wouldn't be dominating the boys track team it's really disrespectful to continue to be on the team knowing that you have an advantage.,3,NOT
the devil is alive and well.,3,NOT
they have the edge against their female counterparts if they want to compete they should advocate for a league on their own let's stop calling apples to pears.,5,ABU

all that botox is making her sick.,3,NOT
look she isn't trans obviously but it's kind of funny how exclusive and special some trans people think they are you are not better than someone else if you have transitioned fully to the opposite gender and actually accept the gender binary umm what about nonbinary genderfluid queer i just love how so many people in various minority groups such as lgbt like to and have literally no problem with telling other people how wrong they are but then insisting that other people accept them for who they identify as eg trans) it's just baffling even if you don't agree or understand how can you justify that when that is literally your life or has been in the past people judging you and not accepting you it's just preposterous it's like people with disabilities judging and not accepting other people with disabilities solely or in large part due to their disabilities like a deaf or blind person claiming they don't see it as a disability and insisting you accept them as they are and then judging not accepting and being ableist towards someone with down syndrome or who uses a wheelchair or something like wtf?,3,NOT
can't be everything and nothing all at once.. i'm a fn mum i don't glam everyday and walk out the door in full garb to go to the shops just because i identify as a man i wear pants and shorts and big baggy t's but i classed that as i prefer to wear those things not because i think i'm a man her comment about having a dick makes things easier? shit is hard no matter what your genitals are i feel she did this cause no one wants to hear about jason anymore and she obsesses over things this being no different i don't like masculine older men but jason and previous bf's prove different i'm a straight white female so i don't know if i have the right to have my opinion on this matter but here it is  great video blair loving your content lately,3,NOT
i think it's incredibly ignorant for you to imply that for trisha to actually be trans they have to transition i'm not defending trisha and saying if they're tans or not but you saying the the only way you would believe trish is if they transitioned is you implying that any trans person needs.to transition to be an actual trans person,3,NOT

at first i found her video hilarious but then i got a migraine see i'm ftm myself and in the past i've watched trisha's videos but only the ones where she hung out with other youtubers like shane dawson jeffree star etc that being said i never thought she was a bad person just a bit on the dramatic side now when i first viewed her.. video i was like cry-laughing choking on my drink and shit but when i really began thinking and began seeing others getting offended by it i rewatched it i can see why everyone's flipping shit trisha is literally using the transgender community to stay relevant because showing her tits on camera as a  year old woman is not working for her anymore that's.. that's bullshit. i remembered all the shit i had to through just to get to wear boxers or a binder or cut my hair etc and the shit that i still do go through being a freshman in high school class of 02 ain't lookin too open-minded.. yikes and that got me thinking what the fuck? like she's making us look worse the transgender community is already a hailstorm essentially but she's really dragging us through the mud her apology video wasn't even an apology like most youtuber apologies it was just a video of her trying to defend herself and make herself look like the victim i suggest you view that next sis.. but bring asprin she drags us through the mud but when we knock her ass down into the puddle she dragged us through she cries about it she's almost 0 and i think she needs to get the fuck off the platform really she's mistaking a midlife crisis for a gender identity dilemma luv u blaire you always do such great reactions and you're hella good at debating people and explaining situations you're- and this is gonna sound weird as hell- my favorite right-sider on youtube 3 keep doin what you do  sincerely that one dumbass kid who stays up way too late on pure caffeine alone.,5,ABU
i'm glad you brought up masculinity and femininity not being gender itself i'm  and biologically male but at one point when i was  i was often being bullied for being too feminine and i got so pulled into that that i thought being a trans woman would solve all my problems but looking back now i'm happy that i stepped out of that because i would be depressed and regretful thanks to other men i learned that it was ok to be male and have a feminine side so again thank you blaire for bringing up masculinity and femininity,1,NOT

gigi's video like actually makes me so angry i am not trans or apart of lgbtq community but i 00 support the community so this whole situation makes me so mad gigi as you stated paved the way for a lot of the trans community on youtube and i just feel like she's okay with her mocking them like you've dealt with this pain yourself....the hate of your own body feeling so uncomfortable the mental toll it takes on you and have experienced what life is like...so wouldn't she be able to see trisha is trolling.. i personally feel like gigi is letting down the whole trans community for standing by her she is her friend and she should explain to her that she is not trans and that what she is doing is hurting people.,2,NOT
my opinion  troll video for views  gender shouldnt be a big deal like using jonathan van ness he came out and that's that we shouldnt be shoving things in people's faces  i am a strong advocate for lgbtq rights and it's sad that blaire thinks non-binarism is a fad   trisha is crazy so we shouldnt be really caring too much about her but rather for trans rights  gender dysphoria i see  she just wants to be masc and fem in her gender expression not identity,5,ABU
thank you for calling her out...she is making a mockery out of herself...this is honestly so infuriating...using such a topic to get views...,2,NOT

trisha really seems to struggle with her identity i don't know her or her content that well only hear about her a little from emelia fart and shane dawson but from what i've seen i'm thinking she might have histrionic personality disorder as i can't comment on bpd seeing as how i don't know how much she fears abandonment maybe someone can inform me on that trisha definitely shows signs of radical attention seeking behavior and seductive mannerisms she covers quite a few of the symptoms of a histrionic can't take criticism well had a breakdown because ethan from h3h goofed a little bit on her) seems to make rash decisions now she believes she's trans which isn't something anyone should take that lightly) being overly concerned with physical appearance even though here she claims she walks around wearing no makeup but that's moreso when she's alone which is different) etc can't say for sure though since i don't watch her content directly nor do i know her personally she does generally give me a bad vibe like i can tell i wouldn't want to meet her in person ever.,3,NOT

honestly this is one big reason why i have such a problem with all of the extra genders people come up with they're supposedly fighting against gender norms but creating these new genders is basically saying if you're a guy with these feminine traits then you shouldn't be identifying as a guy and things like that it actually reinforces gender roles by saying you're only a guy if you act like a stereotypical guy and you're only a girl if you act like a stereotypical girl like no when i hung out with guys as a kid and tried to fit in with them that was just called being a tomboy nothing more it's really not a big deal until you start throwing in all these extra genders and specifications on what it takes to be a specific gender,2,NOT
this woman trisha) is absolutely delusional and needs help she goes from one subject to another and she is obviously not sober in this video and most of the ones she makes that are highly controversial she needs to grow the fuck up.,5,ABU
that trisha video disgusts me but all liers for attention disgust me xd but in general the whole movement to use the transgender community for clicks is big oof sometimes they can even hurt real trans people through the bullshit they are talking just in that sense that normal/cis people who see it will get this picture of trans and apply it to everyone they meet in real life who is really trans and treat them badly or in a way they don't deserve to be treated also make more videos with your cat he or she is a cutie xd,3,NOT

i'm not trans but i had an actual diagnosis of gender identity disorder from a psychiatrist  years ago there's a distinction here i think of myself as a very masculine woman but not trans trans requires that you actually make effort to look like the gender you believe you are i can't bring myself to transition because i know it isn't a cure-all to do so i don't even think i could handle the mental changes that come with transitioning having a diagnosis of what is now called gender dysphoria doesn't make me trans.,1,NOT

lol how does her attraction to gay men her being a normal woman who doesnt always doll herself up and her use of an outdated psychology theory that has no scientific proof have to do with being trans she is def trying to get more views not fair for people who are actually trans i'm cis and barely dress up have definitely been attracted to gay men but respected their sexuality) and envy mens power sometimes but like.. no i could never honestly say i'm trans it isn't like that trisha honey btw i love your pronouns genius woman!,2,NOT

i agree with everything you said except for when you said that if you think someone isn't lgbtq you just shouldn't call them by their preferred pronouns and name or believe them when they say they like someone i've thought that people have faked it before and i was wrong so i always just try to be respectful if they aren't hurting anyone i don't care who you like or what your pronouns are i've some out to people i thought were friends and they said i was faking and i'm not and people have said that i'm faking having anxiety for attention when i actually go to therapy and have real problems also the part when you said that celebrities just come out to get more famous one person i can think of that didn't do that is brendon urie from panic at the disco he came out as pan he donates to lgbtq charities and he had the highest hopes foundation he also sings girls/girls/boys at all the shows not everyone just wants to come out to be interesting some people just want their fans to understand them more and feel not as alone sorry for my rant thanks for coming to my ted talk,2,NOT

i kind of understand trisha i always was interested in guys that are femine i was also attracted to this one girl who was really masculine basically i am attracted to people that are between genders although i like masculine guys also. when i was younger i always was gay guy in my erotic dreams still to this day i sometimes have a dick in my dreams however i don't think about changing my gender i'm comfortable enough in my skin to say that since guys usually prefer women i wanna stay female additionally if i can't be a handsome guy i rather not be a guy at all if she have similar issues to me then i think she is overreacting maybe trying to get the attention she succeeded. edit i written it while still watching i am now sure she is there only for the attention.,3,NOT

this is definitely one of her many troll videos she just needed some adsense money as no one really cared about her moaning about david dobrik for months,3,NOT
that video was a little different in my opinion i legit feel like trisha just wants so badly to belong somewhere that's she's just grabbing at straws now and not caring who she hurts on her way i don't think this is her trolling i think this is her desperately trying to inject herself somewhere anywhere she thinks she might be accepted.,2,NOT

telling trisha that she's not transgender is no different than other people in the past being told they just have a mental illness that come out as transgender anyone can be transgender just bc she doesnt qualify as trans to some doesnt mean she isnt love and acceptance should be towards everyone,2,NOT
at one point i thought i wanted to be trans but really i just wanted to be a boy cause i'd feel more powerful in a way i'm so glad i didn't do anything stupid like transitioning and instead worked to be a stronger woman when i began to embrace my more gothic side i really got that strong edge i was craving i finally feel more intimidating.,2,NOT

her reasoning for being 000 trans is incredibly contradictory to the ftm community trans men who are attracted to men get attacked constantly for fetishizing gay men and people think that they were so obsessed that they had to transition and that's literally what trisha is saying and having short hair has absolutely nothing to do with being a man she can easily be empowered as a woman with short hair there's no use helping this dysfunctional hungover woman,5,ABU

trisha deserves zero respect from everyone and anyone.,3,NOT
i think she's getting self presentation and gender identity mixed up as well as letting her sexuality confuse how she feels about her own gender theres also the big possibility she's conpletly trolling.,2,NOT
trisha may be an attention whore but if she is trolling with all this and people take her seriously i'll have to take my hat off...lol,5,ABU
i mean i love the look of being a masc almost stereotypical lesbian sometimes because i feel good like that do i also like looking super feminine and pretty yes you can enjoy masculinity and femininity but like what also she doesn't want they/them/he/him pronouns so i'm perplexed.,2,NOT
so i'm a girl who is attracted to gay guys even though things would never work out lol) does that make me trans...hell no,3,NOT
i really really really think trisha is a bit smarter than we make her out to be she understands how to get clicks and traffic to her channel no such thing as bad publicity and i really think she is making fun of how crazy and trendy some people are with identities i see her video as a parody but she wont say that cause she already has bad backlash coming her way,2,NOT
you know i dont really like your channel that much but i agree that trisha is not transgender she needs help because she's sick in the head she is an attention seeker with multiple insecurities,5,ABU

wage gap is real you people always conveniently leave out why things happen instead relying entirely on that things are happening.,2,NOT
this is so true feminists need to get over themselves and get to work.,3,NOT
"so a . cents is acceptable the problem with this video is that you don't look deep enough you explain the differences by choices of career carreer evolution and working hour this is where the sexist issues are when choosing an orientation women are told that petroleum ingeneering etc is for men and that early education nursing and such are for women as for evolution we see that with equal education a man will be more and faster promoted than a women a study gave the same curriculum to companies half with the name john half with the name jessica the companies were willing to pay john ,00 a year more than jessica that is sexism in the enterprise finally women are working less hour because they are still the ones who have to take care of the children of the house etc so of course they can't stay as long in the office once all these problems have been addressed then we will see equality since you like maths you should know that according to the millions of people we are talking about the law of large numbers applies aif there was no inequality the pay difference should be infinitesimal thanks for reading until the end it shows open mindness.",2,NOT
i hope that the female population and the media finally gets it what you earn depends on the choices you make not on your sex.,2,NOT
just sent this video to a feminist i was blocked right away xd,3,NOT
thanks for this video i am at awe with the fact that i have met people who genuinely believe that the wage gap exists.,3,NOT
90 of statistical data is made up on the spot,1,NOT
oh it's only  less then i guess it isn't an issue right who cares as long as it isn't a 3 difference how can you cite a study showing a gender-based pay gap and then say there is no pay gap how dumb do you think we are this video completely sidesteps the fact that women feel compelled to enter these traditionally female majors just as men gravitate towards traditionally male majors it's kind of unfortunate that women were given lower-paying jobs when they entered the workforce in ww2 because now the roles have solidified into basically the same roles from  years ago men get higher-paying jobs because they were traditionally the main income earner and women were either single and living on their own or just earning a little extra pay i've gone through the data did you know that women are more likely to switch majors if they earn a low grade in the introductory classes c's get degrees yet for some reason women feel pressure to earn better grades than men on average prageru also forgot that maternity leave is expensive and that it's the most commonly cited reason employers have when they are found to have different pay rates for men and women in the same job why would you hire someone who gets a month of paid leave when someone else doesn't when a woman goes on maternity leave a new temp must fill in until she is gone or the firm goes with one less worker for a month either way it's an expense they don't have with male employees.that's why people are arguing for paternity leave so this difference is resolved prageru best cherry-pickers on youtube who needs truth when you can just ignore everything that proves counterpoint to your beliefs?,2,NOT
this is a woman saying this meaning feminists are people who want money,5,ABU
theres a study by the berau of labor statistics that shows in fine enough detail same job different pay they do not state anything about employers but it does highly suggest a wage gap exists theory higher paying companies tend to hire more men for whatever reasons) this would create a pay difference not seen anywhere but statistics only way i can imagine wage gap existing and that study really does suggest it does also jobs that will match your pay from one place in order to hire you that'd be another way unequal pay could exist then femtards take this sliver of fact and go nuts with it.,3,NOT
for once i'm actually happy i got an ad on yt i really hope this vid spreads more so more people will know,1,NOT
but why do women have less good positions?why are they less educated?why do they take less paied jobs i'm not a feminist,3,NOT
guess what the wage gap exists even between only men but of different age between different parts of the same city among men in different fields etc etc etc.,3,NOT
i had the biggest smile at the first line d,1,NOT
my mom still refuses the facts if only she understood the people influencing her are crooked and just have a good personality on tv,3,NOT
if women can be men and men can be women and gender is a just social construct then there is no such thing as a wage gap.,3,NOT
the fact that a woman is explaining in this video proves this show no gender bias.,2,NOT
because men don't think women can do the same jobs as well you idiot.,5,ABU
have you ever seen an all female construction crew build a  floor skyscraper ,2,NOT
the fact of the matter is that when you look at the big picture women generally do not want the same job types as men far more men go into stem jobs like engineering mathematics science and technology those jobs pay way more as a result when you look at the total amount of money earned between men and women men make more but when you account for the differences in job types and education the wage gap vanishes to a much smaller amount  cents per dollar not the  cents claimed) to illustrate this point further white people only make  cents for every dollar that an asian person makes the reason is not because there is some discrimination going on it is the exact same reason that men make more than women as a whole this is because even more asians go into stem jobs than average caucasians wage gaps really have very little to do with discrimination it just so happens that women for whatever reason do not choose to go into higher paying jobs and do not choose to work as much overtime etc and it just so happens that asians go into high paying jobs even more that is why whites make  cents for every dollar than an asian makes and that is why women make  cents per dollar that men make it's just looking at the total amount of money that a group makes it is not accounting for differences in what types of jobs different groups go into it does not account for voluntary overtime differences and it does not take into account educational differences etc it's only looking at the total income of men versus women and this produces a very misleading result.,2,NOT
you just destroyed every wage gap feminist sjw guy.,3,NOT
this is shocking,2,NOT
the lord shall bless you,1,NOT
get ready for it...the next argument about the wage gap that feminists are now using is males simply won't allow them to enter the higher paying professions men are sexist and competitive and therefore scare woman away from the career by hurting their feelings so now instead of choosing petroleum engineer women now have to go into a lower paid position like social work their arguments never die they just come up with new stupid ones after their old ones are debunked and die out i've actually had feminist friends say that girls are purposely intimidated out of math and science careers so that men can solely hold those positions.,3,NOT
the only thing this shows is that the politics has to do something so that women are able to work long hours and have children just like men!!!!!,2,NOT
"whilst i agree that the traditional idea and slogan of  cents to a dollar is misleading and fails to take into account all kinds of factors we can't blame the lack of women in the scientific fields on the idea that men and women make different choices"" its a weak argument there remains strong social stigmas and discouragement against girls and women in those fields which we must fight against.",1,NOT
so women are dumb basically.,5,ABU
this gave me a better understanding of the topic i didn't believe the wage gap made that much of a difference because it really does depend on the job occupation you chose it is understandable why a women would get paid less since he jobs women chose are much safer than the jobs that men do men are capable of doing much more than women in a physical manner it is not sexist its just how people were made in the video it explained that if you do the math the wage gap only depends on your occupation and the amount came out to . cents women tend to stick to jobs like counseling social work and education these jobs are considered the worst paying majors the highest paying majors are careers like engineering and science based which men have a high percentage employed in these fields i agree with the videos argument the wage gap is more of a myth and that it is all based on your career options its not to often you see a women working a very laborous and dangerous job its a mans job because they are able to put up with certain jobs better than women.,2,NOT
"(coal miner) i cant breath""....(nurse).. i don't give a shit he worked  hrs last week i need thanksgiving off! meanwhile coal miner died i would argue men should make more then they do now.",5,ABU
as a loan officer at bofa so during the course of a day i would ask several people how much money the husband and the wife makes i found in the vast majority of families it is actually the woman with the stable job who makes more money but when they average in the the high wage earner males into it it appears that men make more so for example out of couples would have the wife who makes more money they fourth the husband may make more than all of other men and women put together i am guessing that are looking the the numbers in the fourth family the wife is likely to not work at all so they would count her income as zero because her husband makes more money then all of the other people combined they would then say men make more money on the other hand i find liberals lie about statistics and really bend the rules to come up with the result they want to come up with.,3,NOT
my mother is a personal trainer she makes around minimum wage my father is a plant manager he pays for just about everything my mother chose to switch from the factory work my dad stayed in after having my sister she wanted a more flexible schedule so she could be able to take care of us she went and got her dream job dad is usually on call can work up to  hours on a bad day and on a good one he has been at the same place for almost  years if he could he would get an easier lower paying job but he can't afford to my fiancee is a mechanic he makes 2 an hour unlicensed when he writes his test it could jump to  0 when we have kids he could be close to 40/hr i am going into medical office administration while it can eventually pay in the 20s i will never earn as much as him unless i end up being promoted or get extra schooling i am at a disadvantage though when kids happen we both want me to be stay at home until the last kid is in school so that's a lot of years of advancement i lose this is my choice in the end no matter what a woman who wants a family will end up sacrificing more time even if just to birth and recover what we need to do is encourage women to try trades and high academic pursuit shared maternity leave or father maternity leave fathers as stay at homes seriously if you could afford it who wouldn't love time off. or even when you are staying home and on leave taking classes related to your field to keep your knowledge current i believe that if we want to we can close the tiny gap left and all be happy.,1,NOT
so 4 feminazis thumbed this down i know those pesky facts.,6,ABU
this argument is used so much that i just say men earn it!‚Äù,2,NOT
ok i'm reading lots of comments about how a teacher makes less than a ceo clearly people didn't watch the video it's about fir the same job a ceo would definitely make more the argument were making is for the same job don't get butthurt about my opinion it's what i think.,2,NOT
now i'm thinking about international economics like outsourcing for reduced cost where a country is labor intensive.,1,NOT
interesting how silly videos brought me here well glad they did because this has given quite the impression very educational and informative and these videos help me understand what makes the stupid people so stupid thumbs up,3,NOT
1:1 actual wage gap shrinks to only . cents when you factor in different choices men and women make. :2 the small wage gap that does exist has to do with differences in individual career choices. but that's exactly what the study accounted for!!!,3,NOT
what i want is a study done on is the like to dislike gap actually don't bother...üòÇ,2,NOT
thank you prageru my very leftist school just held a whole school assembly about the gender wage gap and how it's such an awful problem' this video has given me a lot of facts to fight back with d,2,NOT
the biggest argument for there not being a pay gap is the equal pay act of 96 which made it illegal to discriminate against women's pay every year there is an average of 00 law suits over the violation of this law roughly  percent win that's 5 people a year can actually prove that they were discriminated against in the workplace that's mind bogglingly few people.,2,NOT
does anyone have the link to these studies contradicts other data i've found so far so would greatly appreciate.,1,NOT
im sorry but i think these facts should be examined carefully st companies do not only want to reduce costs they are willing to hire better professionals paying them more nd women tend to chose low paying majors not just because of simple individual will culture sex roles family etc are mediating variables that influences these decisions same in men men are raised hearing they should be/are good at math and fixing things also they are socially rewarded by compliments etc by being good at these fields no doubt they chose engineering and math as a major their toys as kids are astronaut dolls and mechanics women toys are babies and nurse barbie women are raised as the caring ones the mommy ones no doubt they chose social work and early education it is sexism people don't make decisions out of nowhere culture and society are playing a role there rd we need to examine why men are willing to be on call in a job men have the pressure to be the provider in the family that's why they are willing to be on call willing to have a better salary women don't have these pressure and the ones who have it are not the standard this video has some points but i think every idea exposed here needs to be discussed in a deeper way it shouldnt be this simple to talk about a subject this complex.,2,NOT
i feel bad for myself that i am a woman and i have make really big choices in life like to pause my career to bear a child.,2,NOT
there is still an unaccounted pay gap that can't be explained by less experience or choice of workhours but that gap is only about ~8% not the 0 or more some people throw around still a gap is a gap and worth trying to close although socio-economic issues can still have effects long after the innitial cause is solved meaning that policy regarding the gap shouldn't be too radical or prevention of yesterdays problems.,2,NOT
"""hey that's pretty good.""",1,NOT

don't you understand  we are patriarch every night i say to my daughter that she should not go to college or in stem  oh wait we don't.,3,NOT
i wonder whether it's ever occurred to her that maybe the reasons why women choose to go into fields that pay less and to work fewer hours etc are because of the way our society is structured unequally which is still a relevant sexist issue in any case a wage gap narrowed to .8-7 is still wage gap and not negligible like she seems to think.,2,NOT
some women are either just dumb or simply stupid for thinking a myth such as the wage gap actually exists.,6,ABU
i'm all for equal pay for equal work but here's my cents from the computer science field i work in a group of 0-ish people  if you extrapolate to the other subgroups working with us among all of them are women one does pure managing one does pure testing and that leaves a single woman actually writing or designing code  even then i have to personally coach her so she can write proper code there's sexism and there's objective data i'll leave you the role of finding which i just used.,3,NOT
couldn't have explained it better myself i hope more people keep watching this video thanks.,1,NOT
so.. there is a gender wage gap by . to .6% this video implies that men are more hardworking than women and wage discrimination is due to this occurring keep in mind though that the department of labour concluded that this margin is not explained so there is a contradiction in this video.,2,NOT

ok i am  yrs old and have always been told i am observer of the human scene and i have witnessed something interesting these gender wage gap surveys can't be generalized for every and all jobs i have witnessed half a dozen examples where women actually make more than men in some industries doesn't anyone say anything about that no because of the modern feminist movement fact is that we're human beings and we usually gravitate toward a man or woman when a seeking a service or a product need an example i used to work as a bartender and server i cleared more tips in a day than my male counterparts cleared in a week need something further up the food chain i disagree with what this lady said about male nurses as i used to work in a hospital and heard the stories about nurses even with male nurses who would chat with me when days were slow i have witnessed first hand that female nurses get paid more than their male counterparts to the point that there male counterparts have to go on welfare because they can make enough to even pay their bills even you are a doctor at times a person will gravitate more toward a woman or a man example women who are gynecologists dermatologists acupuncturists psychiatrists psychologists alternative health professionals get paid more than their male counterparts how do i know this i work as medical biller and have done this job for  years doing bills for various healthcare professionals so is there a gender pay gap no i have come to the conclusion that it all just depends on where you are in the world how you work etc,2,NOT
this is awesome and all but since when do femenist and leftist care about facts?,3,NOT

so what you're saying is there is a wage gap.. the argument is just over the size of that wage gap?,1,NOT
come on prageru you already made a video about this same exact topic years ago pull your heads out of your asses,3,NOT
this video is accurate on every account...except when it comes to child-rearing the reason why men work longer hours even without prior notice is because they are the ones that more than half the time are responsible for less than half of all child and home related activities and responsibilities sexism does exist and even now women are still expected to take care of more than 0 of all domestic responsibilities this video implies sexism plays no part whatsoever and fails to factor in who takes care of the children in american households and how much.,2,NOT

so what is there to hate about this video? why would you unlike it? these are facts,2,NOT
my only complaint about this video is that the average is not the median it's the mean someone please explain to me why all these videos and articles use median instead of mean when they are referring to the average the mean average the median is the middle number it separates the top half of a group from the bottom half why would you use the median in this case why wouldn't you use the mean average) surely some statistician could explain this.,2,NOT
0:0 literally what i always say.,1,NOT

i recently said to a feminist instead of gender quotas why don't feminist just encourage men who are willing to step aside for equality to do so i'm sure alot of males out there would happily give up there job to play video games or watch sports all day allowing women to come in and fill the jobs those males leave behind she got so angry at the thought of males sitting home playing video games all day while women like her had to go out and work hard encouraging males in good positions who are willing to quit basically gives the same end result as gender quotas more males won't have those jobs and more females will but boy do feminist hate the thought of the men who lose those positions actually enjoying free time as unemployed people i don't believe in gender quotas or encouraging men to step aside for equality just knew the thought of a man being happy playing video games all day while women like her had to go to work would really piss off feminists and give me a good laugh),3,NOT

i thought that it was by average earnings by women and men and i argued about things such as choosing different paths and hours but because of this it seems that women make more considering how many women work full time,2,NOT
so basically there is a average pay gap because women mostly choose lower paying jobs on average than men,2,NOT
follow up question what factors might be influencing such unanimous choice if 97% of people choose something that is very suspicious for example imagine a political election with that kind of skewed result consequently the 7/10 difference is revealing of perhaps an inequity in treatment that cultivates these choices that presumably should be confronted at least considered and certainly not ignored.,2,NOT
only problem i've seen is that women not mothers don't get raises as often men but aside form that if women want equal pay for equal work stop having kids to a business kids are a burden that take you away from your job and making them money a working mom is not as valuable as a childless male or female or even a working father who takes little time off get over it you chose to have kids and the problems that come with them you can't expect to be paid the same as a person who rarely takes off and works on holidays and over time while you take off to spend time with your kids or take care of them if they are sick it's just common sense.,3,NOT

why is there a wage gap at all simple women make decisions that man cannot do women get pregnant men don't so they can continue to work unimpeded for the next months even if they don't get pregnant women overall have more health concerns that take them away from work and another reason men make more is because various jobs often tend to use money to incentivize people to take them it's why men dominate the careers that tend to expose oneself to unsanitary filthy disgusting conditions the most dangerous jobs in the nation are overwhelmingly male.,3,NOT

its exactly as she says about how being able to define the gender wage gap is hard to summerise when there are so many contributing factors to these causes of a wage gap other studies show evidence of the gap because of the areas they research the cause of the gap while other studies conclude that there is no gap because of where they focus their research and evidence on its very hard to come to a decision or view point when there are so many contradicting factors to consider.,1,NOT
lol thats not really true she twists the data to show what she wants but you can't really expect her to present on wage gap while she's agaisnt feminism while i was working in service early college years i was doing basically nothing but was paid more than my female counterpart the problem with wage gap is that women have lower hourly wage than men this can of course change if you're manager and negotiate about your potential income but if you'll come somewhere for some basic no-school position and they'll offer you less only because you're a women that's the problem.,2,NOT

one of the most ignorant videos i've come across this argument is incomplete and the explanation is fragmented.. this video tries to propagate the lie that gender wage gap is due to individual choice let's take responsibility for the sexism that discourages occupational mobility do women choose to have lower paying jobs recognize that opportunities for men and women are not equal which is reflected in the wage gap women are limited in the kind of jobs they can access because of access barriers in both education and employment tests are designed to be more difficult for women than men attitudinal barriers about gender roles prevent job mobility this video conveniently doesn't address systemic problems of oppression that affect the opportunities available to women.,2,NOT

and this is why the wage gap is more sexist towards men than women men are seen as the expendable workers who are expected to work or even give their own life to provide for women they are forced by society to take higher paying and more dangerous jobs while women either stay at home and live comfortably off of their husband's money or work in a comfortable low paying job men are seen as expendable workers who must respect and provide for women and women are seen as holy princesses who have to live their lives comfortably this is also why men aren't allowed to hit women because women are the men's superiors and must be treated with respect and care. it's also why women have their feelings coddled and cared for when men are expected to never show their emotions women deserve to have their feelings cared for because they're not expendable and no one gives a shit about mens emotions because they are expendable.,3,NOT

" glaring issues one mathmatical and the other conceptual begining with the marh you're using the word median and average interchangeably wich skews your conclusion as they are not the same thing to show this differences i'll use simple numbers if you have a data set a set of numbers representing value the numbers in this example are chosen to display the difference between between average and median that contains these  numbers 1,3,3,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,7,26 to find the average of these numbers you find the sum 1+3+3+4+4+5+5+5+5+5+5+6+6+7+23 and devide it by the amount of numbers 90\15=6 this average however does not account for the massive outlier a number far removed from the main grouping in the data set wich skews the data higher if you wanted the median of this data set you count inward from both sides to find the middle number with 5 the number with numbers on each side of it wich is in this case  though that difference seems small and are pretty close the numbers we used in this example are small and when you start comparing data sets and bring percentages into it the difference becomes bigger imagine we have a different data set let's call it set b and call our original set a and set b has an average of and a median of  if we compare the averages we get a  different because /6=1 they are the same number however if you compare median you get a 7 different as /5=.8 and -.83=.17 that difference is small with are numbers but when you have larger data sets like data on wages that percentage makes a difference and that difference between average and median can skew your conclusion wich is why all the citations of information in this video are incorrect because you're using studies that compare medians and studies that compare averages together and interchangeably and therefore reaching a not entirely incorrect but nevertheless fallacious conclusion now issue  a bit shorter you cite that / too paying jobs are primarily male and / lowest are mostly female and when accounting for this you get a very small wage gap however the comparison of the total averages yields a larger gapthis inherently means that more women work in lower paying jobs wich speaks to a larger sexism issue not with individual employers or even individual industries as you've shown the gaps with industry accounted for is small but can can meaning might indicate a larger issue that because if societal expectations women mostly go into certain fields fields that pay less than mostly male dominated fields congrats to making to the end hope this does something.",2,NOT

i am a feminist i agree with everything in this video which is why if we want to see women on average earning the same as men on average referring to the opening statistic she cited then we need to encourage women to enter certain fields the top paying majors) what this video did not comment on were the reasons women are choosing not entering these fields if the true costs of a certain career are higher for women than for men then of course we will see unequal gender representation in said field by true costs i am referring to the emotional costs of being the lone women or the of facing constant rude comments can take on a person society has a long history of gender roles and it has been a very difficult process for people to breakdown these notions of women's work versus a man's work. for example if women who want to become petroleum engineers not only have to obtain all the same degrees and experience as their male counterparts but also have to overcome social and emotional obstacles which men face to a much lesser degree because this field is already seen as a natural fit for men then of course women are not choosing to enter those fields because they wage they would earn does not cover all the costs associated with that career thus they way to close the gap between average female and average male earnings is to make adjustments at a societal level on how we work and interact with one another attempting to make each professional field an equally valid option for both genders lastly in references to the idea that there is better pay for employees willing to work longer hours or keep more flexible hours the current trend of women choosing jobs or positions with more traditional working hours can be attributed to the fact that women still take on the majority of housework and child rearing responsibilities so of course they cannot accept positions with irregular or extended hours thus if we want to see women changing the sort of hours they work and thus the level of pay they receive then we need to give men paternity leave and try to equally distribute the burdens or parenthood between the two parents assuming you are lucky enough to have two parents).,1,NOT

totally missing the point here there is 00 a gender pay gap though smaller than 3 difference between men and women even with factors such as education level age race and job title in every country around the world i think the reason for this is more biological than social such as men naturally having more risk-taking tendencies such as asking for promotions and women naturally having more caregiving tendencies such as devoting more of their time to household duties.,2,NOT

i actually have a personal story that could shed some light on the unexplained wage gap after calculations my mother was the gm of an advertising company and she had many agents working under but two stood out they both worked the same amount of hours and overtime they both had the same quality of work and had similar qualifications and contracts and one was a man the other a woman and they had both been working around a year and a half one day the woman discovered that the man mad about percent more than her though they had the same position and bonuses when she came to my mother and asked about it she learned it wasn't because of sexism it was very simple the man asked for a raise and got it my mother admitted to the woman that if she had asked for a raise she would have gotten one but because she didn't the guy made more than her on his base salary this is very common in certain fields because men on average have more confidence in the workplace as such they have around a -5x more likelihood of asking for a raise or bonus the woman asked for it and she got it and when my mother was later promoted to senior vp of marketing the man got a promotion to gm why you may ask because he asked for the promotion first and my mother gave it to him as he was a member of the top agents along with the woman the morale of the story is that this smaller wage gap can be explained in certain situations by workplace confidence it is your job to ask for a raise or promotion and not the employer to ask if you want one because confidence and decisiveness in the workplace can trump credentials almost 0 of the time i hope you can all learn from the woman's mistake and use it forward in your career.,2,NOT

the earnings gap is one of the most hilarious public policy discussions of today because  i don't think the government should force women to go into fields solely because they pay more  i don't think the government should force women to work more hours than men to offset the difference in hours worked  i don't think the government should force women to make specific decisions in which job to take which salary to accept  i don't think the government should force women to be unable to take time off from work for childcare childbirth  i don't think the government should force women to demand higher pay over healthcare or other benefits.,2,NOT
the argument of personal choices in my humble opinion is just trash she ignores that our personal choices are highly influenced by our experiences for example as a man i've been teached that i can do whatever i want if i try hard enough however i know tons of women who have been discouraged from the first time they've failed doing something if every time you fail doing something someones tells you not to try again or that you can't do that you are not going to even try making personal choices that involve being surrounded by men that probably are going to feel better than you and are going to make you feel like you're worse than them) you have to take in account the social reality in which you live when you're analizing this you can't take for granted that all men and women make their choices in the same situation because society is not the same for men and women.,2,NOT

men are paid more because they normally have to pay taxes and bills for their families but females are not really expected to pay taxes and bills men also are expected to work hard and longer but women are not expected to do so this also depends on how the genders have done based on quality and positive effects on their companies so overall i think men should be paid more.,5,ABU

this is a complex issue yes gender discrimination happens and yes women are probably paid less than a man because of their sex however there are many things that contribute to the .77 for a  a man makes. some of it is measurable such as education but some of it you can't measure the best way is to take a company with roughly the same experience same college education and than performance indicators to indicate if their is a true gender income inequality right wing will tell you it doesn't exist left will tell you it does but how many will admit it's somewhere in the middle it's probably not nearly as bad as the left portrays but it does exist probably in the tiniest amount.,2,NOT

good video but i have the feeling it is important to contrast some points  until recently women didn't have the same access to the education or leading position as men actually only one think remained from that period the idea that women are in charge of the children more than men this way of thinking creates a lot of problem because entering in trouble with going up the career ladders for women as a woman you are really more likely to be less available for your job than men  again because men have been used to occupate leader positions men are still now doing more studies related to this women on the contrary will do study according to the image built given to her linked to their housing task listen take care and so on.. explaining why they are more often following those studies to conclude i would say that facts presented in that video are true but i think we still need to change the way we see women in the society in my opinion it just cannot be denied that this salary gap is not directly wanted anymore but still due to a wrong old patriarchal way of thinking.,1,NOT

so the simple answer is that men on average are willing to work harder,3,NOT
i showed this to my feminist classmate to convince her and she just got so pissed at all the points that were made in this video,2,NOT
i enjoyed the video and i'm not trying to be provocative but i have sincere remarks/questions individual choices happen in a context saying that men are more able than women to work longer hours or be on call doesn't take into account power relationships or cultural backgrounds eg i have a female friend who was offered a big promotion at he accountant's office she almost didn't take it because it meant she wouldn't be able to be home for diner and she was afraid her husband wouldn't be able to cook and take care of the kids as it turned out he wasn't and she wakes up earlier every morning to cook dinner so that he just has to warm it up) in this case if she had refused the job i totally agree that it would be absurd to say that the company was sexist but it seems as absurd to completely discard any type of sexism in the choices that some women make how can we interpret the correlation between feminization of an occupation and lower wages in europe  years ago most medical doctors and academics were male now it's shifting over and there are many more females in these occupations at the same time we notice that global wages for both men and women are in average 0 lower than what they used to be in those fields do you think it is merely a coincidence?,2,NOT

anecdote women often choose aspects of a job that don't have anything to do with pay for example my boss is a single mother who is now a department head at my small company she used to hold another lower paying position she is still being paid at the scale of that lower position even though she's been dept head for years she knows that if she left she could make considerably more elsewhere why does she stay because she is allowed to pretty much make her own schedule from day to day and to telecommute when she feels like it without even asking permission i don't think there has been a single day where she was here when i arrived and only took a one hour lunch and was here when i left her child has a million extracurricular activities and she can attend to all of them this may be an extreme example but women make these sorts of trade-offs more often than men and it's because they want to.,2,NOT
i can't believe someone would create such a biased video without addressing any of the real factors women may choose to work other jobs because they don't have a choice they don't want to endure the stress of putting up with harassment in jobs that are more suitable for men their husbands expect them to take care of their children therefore not giving them any other choice but to stay at home and imagine being a woman and part of another minority group you will be facing a lot of social barriers videos like these will not change the social structure that has been created over generations so please review your work before making such a biased and misleading video.,2,NOT
thank god for this video finally i won't be seen as sexist towards women who i'm simply attempting to deliver a simple message to this should be shown in schools to prevent young women to grow up in a sexist manner towards males.i hope this will go viral this woman is a hero!,2,NOT

also it's illegal to pay a woman less so there's that too.,2,NOT
when it comes down to it it is society tell me this would you want a woman to work as an aerospace engineer or a chemical engineer or any high paying engineer probably no in society it's not easy for a woman to get those jobs because of their gender and people tell them women can't do this or can't do that dude we have never even had a woman president! women and men are different and men are considered the more hard working gender but there are plenty of hard working women as well and it's not about wage gap it's more about discrimination,1,NOT

all these videos exposing the wage gap all seem to be missing the most important factor which is truth that even if after recalculating the gap we came up to .6% then there is no need to further justify that this .6 has reasons why can we not be rational and accept that this .6 or even .3 out of it is due to discrimination which we all know exist on some level and also we all need to accept the fact that this type of discrimination is not the bad kind as men are naturally better at ceo and managing positions then women which is even reflected by the fact that over 0 of female business owners employ a male to run it for them so overall it doesn't matter how big the gap actually is because it can all be boiled down to who is naturally better and not because of gender discrimination.,5,ABU

no one gets to be right all the time that being said let us pretend for a minute that a job interview is happening where the choice has not already been made about who will be getting the job long before the first interview was even held because some of the same qualities which men use to get ahead in business are discouraged in women within the business environment women do not have the same bargaining power over wages which men have during an interview for a new job the interviewer does not ever offer up front the maximum amount of money that the business has set aside which they can afford to pay the new employee men can bargain more from a position of strength to get that higher wage because this behavior is acceptable for men if a woman ever wants to be guaranteed she will be paid what is right for her skills education level and qualifications then she has to start her own business ladies christy wright has started a program called business boutique which is all about teaching women how to start and run their own business google her online for more information here is your way to get paid what you want hire who you want and set their wages fairly i hope you compete some of these other businesses right out of business.,2,NOT

i'm surprised that schools are violating some of the personal/privacy rights of the students so transgender females or transgender males can feel good about themselves are the state governments in on this and is the federal government in on this how do natural born female students in general feel about sharing washroom and locker rooms with transgender females when i was a teenagers i didn't want to take off my clothes in front of other females it made me very uncomfortable i remember either changing into gym clothes in the bathroom stalls or waiting for all of the girls to leave before changing into gym clothes i could imagine transgender females trying to get a sneak peek of a natural born female's body so they can know how they want their bodies to look if they decide to get surgeries to become more female in the future if i was growing up now and was in high school and i even glimpse a transgender girl just checking me out for those purpose because i know i'm being watched by any girl i would totally take a f in gym and skip it and stay in detention this is how shy i was in school i know there are still females who are like me growing up in this day and time whose loving them and protecting their rights/privacy i hope their loving parents and the same school board that are protecting these two i think all people should have equal rights i just don't think people should just impose themselves on others based on what they feel or think i think we should all respect each other but i feel some people feelings and rights are being violated so others can feel better about themselves we all need to learn to love ourselves regardless of how we look on the outside.,1,NOT

i think trisha is just confused in general she's addicted to pills she's done coke and meth and she drinks drinking isn't that bad but she said she binge drinks which isn't normal or healthy behavior the concoction of shit she's on is probably messing with her chemical balances in her head and she is trying to rationalize how she feels but trying to identify a certain way it isn't right and i'm not defending her it's just way deeper than being trans i don't think she even understands what it means i'm not trans but i understand what trans people go through and how they don't feel like they're in the right body trisha doesn't seem to have a problem with that she's just confused her video was bizarre and i wonder if she was high on pills in a lot of her crazy rambling videos she's high so i don't see this as making any kind of sense lol,3,NOT

i thought i was trans...... turns out just really gay(and misslead) im crossdresser now but thats it,1,NOT

add another t in the acronym for trish she's her own damn thing,1,NOT
trans trender level 0 i'm so trans i identify as the gender i was born with!,1,NOT
can someone genuinely explain to me who this person is i guess i'm uncool or something but i'm seriously curious.,1,NOT
if she say so than she is we identify our self not other people.,1,NOT
in addition trans people typically feel dysmorphia in regard to their genitals trisha literally has a porn website and posts pictures naked.,2,NOT
she doesn't like dressing up so shes a man i guess by that logic i'm a man now,1,NOT
she came out as black wth omg,1,NOT

i think trisha took comments on her videos about her being the boy who cried wolf a bit too literally.,1,NOT
god i like trish and gigi and blaire and i have no idea what is happening lmao,1,NOT
sorry but am laughing so hard at this because she looks like someone who got dr x and nurse duck fuck lips to do her face in lol oh if she is trans or whatever this really is prove it come on lets see it all oh and provide a dna/chromosome test to prove your trans please because last i checked and i looked very hard our genes/dna can't change like a light switch from male to female or this trans thing,2,NOT
honestly i don't think she's trans but she definitely is going through some sort of identity crisis abd i think she's trying to figure out what's going on in her head which is fine to do but she should not be public about it without knowing for sure if she's trans or not and all of her wild ideas of herself she just shouldn't be so open abiut that stuff on the internet bc is can hurt her and others,2,NOT
yes girl i was waiting for this video the minute that bitch posted her video i love u,5,ABU

i totally see you're point and trisha is the biggest trolls so i don't really believe anything that comes out of her mouth however although my opinion may be irrelevant considering i'm cis i believe you don't necessarily have to transition to identify as something other than your assigned gender.,3,NOT
she thinks because she doesn't wear makeup or dress up everyday she's a man i literally would be a man as well if that was true.,1,NOT
trisha knows exactly what to do to get attention and people just need to stop giving it to her.,3,NOT

thank you i just had a convo with someone about how people don't understand that you can be masculine and feminine within the same fucking body as humans we are a spectrum of things a lot of people don't seem to understand you can be a feminine guy or a tomboy...and shockingly you don't have to be a gay man if your feminine or a lesbian if you're tomboy you can be whatever you f e e l you may want something for clout but that doesn't make it true although thinking on this a few days later i'm not sure if she is just having a mental breakdown in general and i hope she gets some good therapy.,1,NOT
omygod why do you straight girls like gays and why do i like straight guys damn,1,NOT
she's not trans she's stupid and has no problem starting shit for views i will never watch her anymore i can't believe in two days she has manages to put down trans gender and mental health she thinks being 15 or baker act means she knows it all.more over she needs to be reminded many younger watch her channel and she sending wrong message ,3,NOT
what i love about blaire is that i can scroll randomly through her videos with my eyes closed and click on anything and be entertained theres not many youtubers i can do that with,1,NOT

i don't get the hate from the usual subjects according to their standards trisha is trans and we must accept that despite her not making any effort to transition if she claims that she is trans or any other gender identity that is obviously the only thing that matters and we have to play along with that so as to not trigger an instance of dysphoria otherwise we are obviously being transphobic at least gigi is being principled by playing along because the rest of the left sure isn't lmao!,1,NOT

i've been waiting for this vid with baited breath...you did not disappoint Ô∏èüî•,1,NOT
yeah i can explain this pretty simply actually i've seen one of her vids where she says that she's been diagnosed at borderline i am borderline also let me just say that this is her very obviously going off the rails for whatever reasons she has bpd is something that requires a life of upkeep it's on the narcissistic spectrum she obviously hasn't been able to take care of herself appropriately and is now giving in to one of the symptoms which is basically that you feel like your core identity is completely malleable it's an identity crisis on steroids and she's trying to get back in touch with herself but she's going in the opposite direction to where she should be gigi probably got an earful from trish and likely isn't so sure about it but wants to support her friend trish was talking a lot about her ex if a borderline person is coming out of a good ol dumping that's when the abandonment issues can kick in this might be what that looks like for her questioning her identity because it wasn't good enough for someone and rebounding into a marriage.,1,NOT
yaaaaaaaaaaassssssss!!!!! i feel like i have been waiting for a billion years for your video!! get her!!,1,NOT
i know she's trolling with the whole i'm trans thing but wasn't she advertising some porn thing with her pussy out?,3,NOT

this is an insult to the whole trans community she's mocking the meaning and struggle of being trans and obviously has no clue what she's talking about weather it's a joke or not it's still discusting that she thinks this is appropriate to post that isn't the only problem with the video she's heavily gender stereotyping and being sexist i am so sick and tired of her trolling and desperate cries for attention.,2,NOT

a drag queen has nothing to do with transgender sure some drag queens later transitioned ex gia gunn however their are drag queens who are gay bi pansexual even rarely straight its 01 people) also drag shows are used as entertainment it's a job that's why they don't go full glam everyday but they dress like gay men because they are gay men who are working drag queens smh trisha there's my two cents peace üèª,1,NOT

i support whatever the fuck people wanna be but just because you dress down or dress up it doesn't change who you are it's common to not dress up everyday either it's a everyday normal thing it means nothing but comfort or style that you may want to wear then and there i don't wear makeup everyday i try to just do my eyebrows or lashes before i leave the door that's it i try to dress up nicely for the most part but if i leave looking under dressed so what no one truly gives a shit and who cares if you're comfortable nothing to do with anything else.,1,NOT

i totally agree with you on the trisha topic but i guess it's okay for sam smith to come out as nonbinary i believe in nonbinary being a thing i don't believe in genderfluid astrogender or anything crazy like that but when a person is trans and can't identify with being either male or female i believe it's okay for them if it fits them to call themselves okay english is not my foreign language is themselves with v correct? nonbinary if that's what makes you feel euphoric and eases your dysphoria hell yes go for it and with sam smith i just hope we have a positive example of a nonbinary person i just hope for some other representations than those crazy astrogender transtrender).,1,NOT

talk about grasping at straws trisha just needs to go back to her other life style where she belongs because this isn't it she's a hot mess that like i said just needs to go she's disgusting with this!!,5,ABU
trisha makes these video's because they get her attention and she knows she will get away with it any other person would've been cancelled but since it's trisha and she's been problematic from the beginning of her yt career it is expected from her and people give her a pass anyway after acting offended for maybe a week and a half.,2,NOT

hey blaire i'm not a constant viewer of your channel but i saw some of your videos and find your opinions quite interesting i don't agree with all of them but hey that's the joy of conversations xd there's one thing in particular i always find puzzling when hearing people's opinion on the matter and that matter would be men and woman are biologically different especially when it comes to the male/female brain that is what i believe not based on studies but what i consider common sense each sex has it's own good and bad attributes in varying portions and there are people now opposing the idea that there are differences between the two sex however if there is no difference that would contradict a lot of the base argument for their topics if men and woman are the same why make a big deal out of the first female insert job here)' it was because before women where expected to have overcome bigger hardships that it seemed like a breakthrough to get into male dominant positions if there's no male and female characteristics why do you wish for a female president if there's no difference why is it about time you get one that whole idea is based on the expectation that a woman wouldn't be as cruel as a man and more levelheaded in stressful situations equipping her with positive female traits) this contradiction just seems quite obvious and blatntly ignored by those claiming absolute unity of man&woman i would like to hear your opinion on this and perhaps other commenters to get some ideas from different perspectives  btw i'm neither here or there on this matter i find labels nonsense don't care who you are anyone can do what they want as long as they put effort into it and as long as they don't harm someone else it's fine with me.,1,NOT

she can only decided if she's trans however  drag queen is not a gender  being attracted to gay men gay men are attracted to men of all types masc fem think bear otter  she's stereotyping traditional gender roles  if she's 000 ok with her gender and body she's not trans to my understanding isn't being trans meaning being uncomfortable in your own body because it doesn't match how you view and feel about yourself ,1,NOT
while i do think she's joking i think it's harmful because she has such a big following and bc she's the first or second video to pop up when you type transgender if she's going to mock a struggle and make some impressionable cis people think they're trans she should take into consideration how many people will see it and will believe it i don't think she even realizes how many people will see that video and it'll be the deciding factor for them to transition and then detransition because they done goofed.,1,NOT

"the sex based pay gap is a lie the inference by feminists is that a man and a woman working side by side doing the same job don't get paid equally that is a lie the pay gap is an average of all male and female workers across all careers the reason men as a whole make more than women as a whole is simple you don't see as many women choosing to work dangerous demanding hazardous jobs how many maternity ward nurses are dying from black lung like coal miners do how many social workers are week long shifts non stop like oil rig workers or working construction on buildings with only a harness for weeks without break men also tend to work more hours every week so obviously they'd be paid more equal pay isn't possible unless there's equal effort so ladies if you want the pay gap to decrease stop going to school to be a florist and join a fire academy otherwise shut the hell up and stop saying things like being a mother is the hardest job in the world"" if you can do your job in your pajamas then no it's not the hardest job in the world.",2,NOT

this video while has some correct information is presented and framed in a way to show the side of the argument that affirms that the wage gap is not real there are similar videos put out by other organizations that have the same format they present facts in a way that supports there argument and leaving out those that don't while that wage gap is not as big as some groups claim it is larger than this video claims the topic is very complex and there is no definitive answer because the every situation is different so to say its a us versus them argument is just letting a very complex situation fall pray to party politics.,1,NOT
i was checking my subscription box when this video played and i was just about to hit the skip button until i heard there's no such thing as wage gap decided to watch till the end and immediately shared in all my social media losing some friends probably...,1,NOT

while i seem to agree that this video is right about it's point it didn't really disprove the wage gap instead it puts the gap into perspective also you assumed that the people pushing the wage gap are liars ignorance and a whole slew of other factors can make a person stick with the wrong opinion.,1,NOT

there's a gap but it isn't because women are paid less due to their gender it's because they are expected to sacrifice their career for their children because of their gender if more women had the support to work full time and men felt comfortable being the more full on parent i don't mean that dads are lazy or don't care we wouldn't have women complaining about the pay gap and men complaining that the system is against them when it comes to children.,1,NOT

the issue is not that women are paid less it's that we value traditionally masculine jobs more than feminine ones teachers nurses and caretakers are seen as less valuable than engineers scientists and other masculine careers ultimately both women and men should have the freedom to choose a career without having to think of preserving their masculinity or femininty we need both men and women in teaching we need both men and women in engineering we need both men and women in the military we just have to work together.,1,NOT

so i identify myself as what these people in the comments seem to hate and villainize a feminist it is true that the myth has been debunked but you still have to acknowledge that women recieve much more obstacles to the path of a successful career then there are safety issues attached with the working late hours also childbirth is a major reason for women to compromise on their careers regardless the wage gap is a myth and it's a little known idea we need to spread the word.,1,NOT

i understand why men hate the feminist movement men are not personally responsible for the devaluation of women's work to tackle this problem from the perspective of feminism is a mistake because it points the finger at men rather the finger should be pointed to capitalism businesses pay women less now and historically because they can and could so yes i believe in equal work for equal pay yet the lower paying jobs seem to be women's work. is it then actually a choice or enslavement?,1,NOT
i'm pretty sure you guys have already made a video on the wage gap why another one?,1,NOT
the on going debate continues on whether there is a pay gap between men and woman and there are many arguments on both sides with opposing views on this issue the way gap brings up the issue that women are payed less than men in the working field most statistics for this topic come from the census bureau which looks at full time workers according to gould schieder and geier they go into detail explaining the different ways in which other people analyze the wage gap from looking at specific occupations or by taking into consideration part time jobs and how this may lead people to think that data on the wage gap is unreliable however no matter how people approach how they measure the wage gap there is always a gap i feel that those that do not believe in the wage gap look at the specific occupations or varying forms of measuring the wage gap such as christina hoff sommars in the myth of the gender wage gap. in every example she explained there was still a gap between men and women whether big or small a gap is still evident her argument claiming that it is the pursuit of happiness that steers women and men to different career paths is not completely true there is a restriction women have due to their roles in motherhood and according to equal means equal even in female dominated professions men still get paid more looking beyond professional careers and taking into consideration professional sports teams men get paid much more than women when it comes to sports consider soccer although the women's soccer team far excels in the sport over the men's team they still get paid much less than them.,1,NOT

ok but why do we perceive female dominated professions as requiring less skills and money etc for example computer programming and coding was considered a low level menial job when it was female dominated yet now coders make oodles of money and the job has a lot of respect we respect physicians yet in russia where medicine is a predominantly female workforce they have no respect for the profession there librarians were once respected and well paid and even now when they have more skills and education than ever before they are laughed at and paid like shit ever since females started dominating the profession teaching was also the same i don't think women are paid less for simply being women i think we value male work over female work if you compare education levels for different jobs you will find that in female dominated industries they will be lower paying than similar levels of education than in male dominated industries since women have taken over the field of biology the median wage has gone down 8% wages for designers fell by 4 when females started to gain ground in the industry of the  top highest paying professions  are male dominated.,1,NOT

see i have trouble with this video it does present facts but is very biased how does pay and bonuses compare between men and women in executive roles how does pay compare between men and women managers and supervisors how does pay compare between men and women in technical fields engineering programming etc) really i could probably make a video espousing the benefits of tobacco smoking how it helps focus the mind increases productivity reduces stress in stressful situations is a mild appetite suppressant so can help with weight loss without leading to an eating disorder doesn't cause mental instability like hard drugs do afterwards you might be totally convinced that smoking is amazing at the same time the video would be misleading because it doesn't present the risks of smoking so yeah men and women working in low level jobs are going to be paid the same or are they?) men tend to gravitate to higher earning jobs and women tend to gravitate to caring jobs but i need to see like for like comparisons in a sample of specific fields before i would be convinced making a video like this is just fluff for sexists and misleading for others.,3,NOT

pay gap is it real or not theres so many controversial opinions about this but my opinion is somewhere in between information providing from some of the readings and viewings made me understand and gather some opinions of my own about gender pay gap/gendered labor i actually believe that men are more favored in high paying jobs than women are in adams et al he provided some ideas and real life situations that might cause women to get paid less hold a lower position or not getting hired at all one of them things he mentioned was that some businesses prefer males because in this gendered stereotypical society women are more likely to leave work or miss work for family stuff unlike men where they will choose work first to be able to provide for their family because of this idea that men focus on work more than women it allows men to get promoted easier or get hired first in his book he also provided a list of equal situations for both men and women and how each of them are perceived differently i don't necessarily think theres an accurate pay gap where a man and women with the same job title get paid differently but i do think men are likely to get promoted higher than a women in order to pay them more in the video there is no gender wage gap‚Äù she talked about how the wage gap isn't accurate because it counts for all women and all men working but it doesn't distinguishes between careers or whether they are part time or full time in her video i agree that more of the higher paying jobs is dominated by men and the lowest is dominated by women so of course you see the difference of the pay women and men get like she said it's a choice but its also society's fault for making some careers seem gendered for example engineers for men and teaching for women personally i'm a liberal studies major and i'm choosing a low paying job i'm not sure why or even if i want to do it anymore because of this topic but it was my choice to go for a less paying career.,1,NOT

i've always found this complicated attempt at explaining the wage gap through choices and other factors to be pointless the problem is so much simpler comparing medians just isn't a useful metric it's so well-known that it has a name simpson's paradox for all we know women actually get paid more than men for equal work and the effect reverses when taking a median due to this statistical phenomenon tl;dr medians tell us nothing in this situation period no need to explain why the discrepancy appears with choices hours worked college majors etc.,1,NOT

i agree with the general conclusion of the video...wage gap is not mainly due to sex but more about choices however there is still partial effect let's say % due to the fact that some managers could be women don't prefer to promote women to execute positions due to prejudice and stereotyping from personal experience wage gap is more apparent due to racial and religious differences rather than sex.,1,NOT

what they really mean is women should be paid the same as a man for the same job title not the same work. i have noticed in my life i have had the same job title as women but i was required to lift more any produce more then then women in my job just cause you think you are working harder then someone else doesn't mean you are if someone takes  min to do a job and i take min todo the same job i will spend min pissing around so does that mean the person that took twice as long to do the job working twice as hard nope this idea that woman work as hard as men or harder is bs sorry that woman have to put in more energy to do the same work as men but you are not working harder.,2,NOT

you can't talk about choices most people can't just choose their career they just have to accept the job for how it is and no most people can't decline a contract because they have kids rent and other bills to pay working more hours should not be a virtue in fair society there must be a  hour work week or less women are really disadvantaged because of pregnancy and after birth so they can't work as much as men do a fair government must help women with expanded parental leave we should not think that workers are better if they work more piecework should be already exceeded.,1,NOT

i think it has something to do with the fact that women arent pressured as much as men to work men are waaaayyy more pressured to have money in their pockets so it makes sense they would go for the jobs that pay more sex is also a motivator for men to have money there's still a whole slew of women in the world who aspire to be housewives it doesnt mean women are less ambitious some nurses works 2 hour shifts we just have different levels of whats comfortable.,1,NOT

so it's incredible retarded that this philosopher who works in a shitty university comments on a topic that she clearly knows little about as an economist let me comment on a few things  yes businessman are making a monetary loss whenever they do not hire a women with lower wages since they could potentially lower their labor costs however as gary becker pointed out long ago a right-wing economist who is a nobel prize winner if employers have both some monopoly power and distate women they can get away with discriminating women given that the forces of competetion won't work properly . the same basic result applies whenever the reality deviates from perfect competition for example whenever there are search frictions in the labor market or in other words when you have to actually spend time searching for a job which is the case in real economies)  different career paths may not be choices or voluntary whenever there are gender restrictions on in certain occupations as there are in many places in the develiping world) whenever an occupation is overly seggregated or whenever discrimination caused an unequal distribution of math test scores for example women cannot really choose to be an engineer if they face a gender gap in math to begin with...  of course women work less hours and thus are promoted less ever heard of the glass ceiling? as men why because domestic work is unequally distributed and women bear the whole burden of domestic work in most countries of the world if we had some policies to socialize care work as there are already in place in many developed countries then the gap in market hours between men and women would diminish substantially all of this is not either common sense nor a leftist conspirancy it's just good science.,3,NOT
so you admit that businesses would save 5 by hiring only women to do the same work then go on to say that the wage gap doesn't exist anyone who made it past that and still believed this nonsensical video should really questions their life choices.,2,NOT

the wage gap goes a bit deeper than personal choices society has stemmed from patriarchal norms and in turn women are expected to work these jobs although this may seem like a choice from the women their choice is influenced by history and present day society yes these norms will be hard to change and nobody should expect them to change in any short period of time but opening up more choices for women and trying to learn from history so it is not repeated is a good way to get the ball rolling.,1,NOT

there most definitely is a wage gap between men and women about two thirds of the gap is due to uneven distribution among various occupations and differences in skills and experience while the last third cannot be explained and has been attributed to discrimination in the work force the discrimination can be explained by the glass ceiling which is the seemingly invisible barrier hindering advancement of women and minorities in a male-dominated organization clayton 14) works cited clayton gary e economics principles practices new york ny glencoe/mcgraw-hill 005.,1,NOT

this garbage is a bunch of propaganda.,2,NOT
so why are traditionally female-dominated occupations lower paying than traditionally male-dominated ones ie why do trades people engineers and lawyers making more than teachers social workers and nurses is it because men once ruled almost the entire workforce and put more value on their own strengths and less on female-oriented ones such as caring for others this systematic inequality has been perpetuated over the years it's not just about the choices females make it's about what we value in our workforce that has been dictated to us decades ago by men.,1,NOT
well now there is man are paid less than women,1,NOT
"title there is no gender wage gap"" :2 the wage gap is .6 ..huh it is very true that many people use the 3 wage gap number without any nuance or detail and that number is misleading to the point of being wrong but arguing against the weakest version of your opponent's argument is not very impressive the better informed concerns over the wage gap focus on career choices particularly at universities it's true that better paying college degrees are pursued disproportionately by men and this video simply states it and moves on this is the heart of the question though so.. why do men pursue these degrees at higher rates then women are parents teachers others in society subconsciously steering girls away from the boring nerdy stuff is this a case of the soft bigotry of low expectations do in-school and after-school programs that teach extra-curricular like cad programming electronics etc.. lean towards recruiting boys instead of girls are the teachers of these programs disproportionately men resulting in more role models for boys than for girls does networking through alumni favor male grads because most of the alumni in well-paying fields are alumni creating a kind of inertia that subconsciously favors male over female grads does society place far more pressure on women to marry younger and raise kids leading couples to split child-rearing duties unevenly and slowing done women's careers concerns about the gender gap are commonly dismissed as nothing more than a pipeline problem there are certainly feminists who want to make more out of this than simply a pipeline problem but a pipeline problem is still a problem and in my opinion a substantial one at that realists who want to solve this problem are trying to make schools parents and society as a whole aware with the hope that girls feel like stem degrees are a choice for them but this video it breaks the 3 gap down just enough to get to the answer it's looking for but not enough to acknowledge or delve into the heart of the question this video leads one to think that there's no problem here the reality is that a deeper understanding of the issue requires finding answers to the questions i outlined above deciding if those answers reveal problems that need to be fixed and taking action as needed.",1,NOT

i like this video but i do wonder about when she talks about the choices women make when it comes to job choices because in the highest paying jobs listed women are less likely to take them because of the discrimination and expectations they face so when i look at it they present an illusion of choice that it is 00 women's choice to not take those jobs for the most part this is a well presented video but i'm just thinking about that so maybe it's not only a wage gap problem but also the gender disparity in fields of work.,1,NOT

in the video there is no gender wage gap it starts off by stating a statistic that a lot of sources use that women are paid  cents per every male dollar from the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real?‚Äù it states that women are paid  cents to every male dollar which is not far off from  cents the video i watched had a female presenting all the stats and opinions which is very clever by prager u who posted the video why not show a female talking about how there is no gender wage gap it just adds onto their argument the video states that if a person factors in different choices each gender makes on top of occupation position education and hours per week then then the wage gap nearly diminishes down to . cents i feel as if a person cannot just factor in choices‚Äù because not everyone is in the same situation many women want families so when women are pregnant they go on maternal leave as long as they need or are allowed also women have been proven to do more work around the house and also take time off to be there for their kids women cannot be discriminated against just because of their choices it does not matter their choices also the video does not take into account the fact of race as we learned in class black and hispanic women are paid a lot less than women who are white or asian which is from the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real?‚Äù overall we can each have our own opinion if there is or is not a gap but the video there is no gender wage gap is filled with fallacies that are opinion based and not fact and research based like the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real?‚Äù.,1,NOT

rather than developing a interesting and fair debate on how we look at gender pay gap reports all this video does is reduce the issue to flawed simplistic arguements that suit a certain demographic of people... while the arguement that the way gender pay is calculated may be too simplistic could be a valid this video abandons any hope of a nuanced debate by peddling the notion that most pay gap issues we see is due to the choice of women that will please all the anti-feminists that believe women are trying to take their rights away not sure how youtube's algorithm landed this video inside my echo chamber probably missclicked on too many man on motorbike fights cop videos.,2,NOT
you aren't talking to actual feminists about the attempts to close the wage gap clearly high level efforts to closing the gap aren't simply demanding women get paid more they are more frequently trying to solve the issues that cause the gap to occur those differences that you think need to be accounted for are the very things feminists are trying to address don't control for the issues that cause the gap fix those issues there is also an opportunity gap for many jobs not simply differences based on as you put it choices that it's dishonest to ignore.,1,NOT

hmmm choices maybe it's not really choices but gender roles embedded in our society that in turn control or substantially affect these choices why do women chose majors like teaching or counseling or nursing because those are the roles/majors women are generally expected to be interested in by choosing these majors they are less likely to have to compete with males and more likely to get the job when it comes to jobs like attorney ceo so forth these are jobs predominantly maintained by males and women are more likely to have to compete with them why does this competition matter if the woman is just as good an applicant oh because women are thought to have to pick up the kids when their sick be home in time to pick the kids up from school and have kids which means paid maternity leave and the list goes on thereby lessening the hours she can work and making her less competitive that also answers the hours question.,1,NOT
seems that one study which was omitted is should be obvious that one which cites the fact that the greatest single explanation for the gap is the fact that women give birth to children and are more involved in raising them if fact when this factor is factored out the wage gap favors women it is much easier for women to exit and reenter the labor force than men women have a much greater number of occupations which are easier for them to exit and re-enter than men women simply have many more employment options generally than men the wage gap is mostly a function of the fact that most men are employed continuously whereas that is less likely for most women..,1,NOT

"i like some of prager u's videos but the hypocrisy in this one really bothered me to me it clearly demarcates the true bias that our short-sighted society has against women and true femininity....and it's not the kind of bias that feminists propound we still live in a man's world, remember that song? where women's skills and interests which tend to be verbal and nurturing rather than the stem fields and women's call to be homemakers and to care for children and family members just aren't valued economically it really is unfair many women and yes many men too spend countless hours giving unpaid care to children the handicapped sick and elderly our society expects this more and more doctors are releasing patients who need 4/ nursing and can even prosecute someone who does not care for a family member but then we hypocritically turn around and blame women's choices because they're not as single-minded about a career as men do you realize how much our society depends on unpaid people many of them women to check on the elderly in nursing homes to take care of sick people to call insurance companies and wrangle with doctor's offices to care for autistic kids and small children our society could not afford to pay people to do what lots of moms do every day but this work has to be done and you can't trust that a hireling will always really give your loved one individualized care which is critically important for babies and young children. what this video also shows it that in order to make a man's wages a woman has to somehow truly transgender herself she has to somehow be able to change her brain which is different from a man's and be able to think and act like a man and have the single-minded career-drive of a man or be penalized economically this really puts women in an emotionally painful position and when i was a manager i saw women crying about this) either abandon their children in daycare all the time or simply not have children at all then where would our society be in  or  years i realize that part of the problem is due to the work of extreme feminism. our society no longer supports the traditional view of the family with husband who has the masculine drive and time to specialize in a career as prime provider with a family wage. the change in our economy so that women are now almost forced to work in order for a family to be middle-class is probably the worst thing to ever happen to women honestly although i certainly think that women should have the right and option to choose a career i myself have a master's degree. i'm an extreme conservative and i understand economics one of the areas in which i disagree with conservatism however is when conservatives hide behind the glib statement that people always have a choice. yes we all do have certain choices but we do not have a choice as to our sex as well as our race our intelligence level our physical handicaps and how we are programmed biologically oftentimes the dogma of choice is just used by the intelligent the wealthy the lucky the healthy and the otherwise successful to justify why they should be rewarded more $$$ in our society than others who perhaps work just as hard but in jobs or unpaid positions that our society considers to be menial or unworthy of remuneration.",1,NOT

"talking about the gender wage gap is besides the point because even the concept equal pay for equal work"" built into law violates legal rights that are owed to a person and constitutes a due process violation namely if i due to my personal preferences want to give more of my own money to a man than to a woman that is my personal choice it's my money and i have the right to do what i want with it if i prefer working with men more then with women and thus pay a man more than a woman for equal work no one has the right to intervene and tell me how to manage my own money it is my money but the government does it forces me to pay them equally it forces me to give my own money to someone although i entered no legally-binding relationship with that person but is all based on the ideological concept of equality' given the fact that lawmaker's ideological concept be it equality or whatever cannot trump legal rights that are owed to a person basing the laws on the concept equal pay for equal work is a due process violation.",3,NOT
a little late for this video dude.,1,NOT
what influences those choices made why do women not choose to go into those top earning professions if you say it's because they aren't capable.. that makes you sexist if you say it's because women are reinforced that they are less capable than men from as young as years old which means they grow up to make those choices.. then you agree with science.,1,NOT
i get what you're saying but i think the wage gap argument is meant to be broader than what you are talking about in the video the gap is not  cents big but there is still a gap i am not saying women and men have to do every occupation 0%/50 but the choices women make in terms of going to lower paying jobs is partly due to some sexism in the workplace and society at large a women might want to go into aerospace engineering for example but if she is geared from a young age to play with dolls and take care of things she will slowly go into that career path also the idea of going into a field with mostly men will be daunting because their definitley still is sexism in the workplace guys can easily become friends with one another and move up while a girl in an office full of boys will probably have a hard time playing her chess moves and moving up it is all these little things the wage gap conversation is about its not only about the  cents argument because that is not correct but more so about the extra hurdles women face in the workplace combined this with that fact women have the abilty to get pregnant and deal wiht childcaring makes matters more complex and will affect thier pay.,1,NOT
yes that's right the choice is the difference a woman is expected to take care of children and run the household of course she is not willing to work on call of course she is less willing to move a man expects from his wife to follow him wherever he find a better job but a woman can't expect her husband to follow her where she finds better job as for the dangerous jobs the reasoning is the same the woman thinks that she has a duty toward the children and this duty precedes any high salary soooo.. if and when a man begins take same responsibility toward children and household the gap will disappear but for now...,1,NOT
this video is what we needed it proves that there is no gap in salary for men and women working for the same time we may not have attained equality in all aspects of life and society but it dosen't mean that we don't need to pick our fights i think that is part of the reason modern feminists are seen as radical and such however i don't know about the situation outside of the states and canada so i cannot be sure about it.,1,NOT

you know.. i do recall wanting to take more psych classes because that was the major where the girls were at however i was the fly on the wall of a few conversations where male hiring managers did discuss how between two candidates they female would be cheaper but you could depend on the male the decision was to hire the male because they valued dependability as mentioned in this video over saving the company a few hundred dollars a decision they felt would cost them more in the long run).. it was only one instance but i know it couldn't be the only instant in the world were that discussion was held behind closed doors and i know somewhere down the line the choice of cost would be valued more than dependability a non profit i worked for valued the latter but the boss terrorized the employees by threatening the boot if they weren't dependable at every corner a male worker there was discovered to be making more than his female replacement.. who was wonderful and very dependable but sadly underpaid for her service these videos have great facts but miss that there is an element a bias human element that does come into play when it comes to wages my wife also suffered this while working retail where a male counter part at her same level did less work but was paid higher and my wife was very dependable shit so dependable that we barely saw each other due to the demand of the job.,1,NOT

"perhaps we should ask why the overwhelming female-filled fields get paid so little in the first place for instance why does our society place so little economic value on education a female dominated field if one studies the history of waged labor the genesis of capitalism and women's roles within that system we see that all of the work that has ever been women's work gets paid less because we think it is worth less sometimes not even paid for at all as is in the case of domestic house work) i am calling upon michel foucault's analysis of 500s europe and the rise of capitalism and waged labor as is talked about in the history of sexuality volume  silvia federici also talks about this in chapter of caliban and the witch women were subjugated into the economic machine as unpaid domestic labor while the work of men was waged this gave men the power to feed and house themselves and their wives while the women had no power of independence from their husbands because they couldn't make money that legacy continues on today in a world where we still feel on some level that women's work should be free prageru's analysis also doesn't mention how women can't just move to other cities because they are tied down by dependent children and other social roles within families that men are not as often entangled in this is another arena of unpaid women's work that is brushed aside and made invisible within the realm of the private sphere as opposed to the waged public sphere within which men more often work and of course there is the well known fact that stem areas are not always welcoming spaces to women and in fact can be quite hostile do we all remember the google employee who argued that women are biologically less capable of stem work than men a video that prageru itself also produced and distributed the hypocrisy!) and can we not recognize the role of generalized misogyny in all of this as well being a woman entails being in a world where you are constantly sexualized from the time you hit puberty perhaps even earlier most women recount the first time that they were sexually hit upon by a man at about the age of 2 in an executive world dominated by men we have seen that women are often objectified and sexualized rather than treated as human subjects peers and creators of worth this is a fact that has been increasingly uncovered within the metoo movement perhaps we should talk about the psychological impact of having a boss or professor that sexualizes you and how that impacts your academic and career choices and there lies the key word choices the idea of pure choice is an illusion often harked upon by the right wing and the neoliberal minded the idea that you can pull yourself up by the bootstraps something that literally defies the natural laws of physics and that the psychological reality of living within a patriarchical world as a woman is inconsequential and effortlessly surmountable as much as you glorify the individual who can defy the odds the sociological fact is that you end up with this  cents on the dollar statistic across the board again perhaps it's not that women choose low paying jobs but perhaps that a the material reality of patriarchy does in fact push women towards certain career choices and b the more woman that enter a field the less those jobs pay in the end of the day there needs to be a better reconciliation between the feminist academia and right wing think tanks like prageru these ideas do need to spar head on because without direct contradiction it seems like either side can pick and choose statistics and theories to prove whatever point they want to make case and point being this video) i think the arguments i made here validly complicate the above video and in fact nullify most of its arguments that women earning less is because they choose to"".",1,NOT

"after watching there is no gender wage gap, it has left me with a lot of questions and some clarification on certain things this video proves that there is a gender wage gap but it also clarifies where and how there is a gap between women and men pay i think that the main thing that is being overlooked would be that not all women can work full time or half the time that men do because of child care and other obligations that they have as a woman usually it is just known that woman do all the housework and childcare while the man is out working and making money why don't women get paid the same amount that men do especially when they are doing more work then just their employed job if the situation was flipped and women got paid more i don't think that men would let it go by as easily as the women do not by choice but that it's just what the case is with professional soccer in general whether male or female it has a lot of work put into it the video why is women's soccer so white? it points out a lot of things that differ from men and women professional soccer teams the pay gap with men and women ties into the soccer world because men get paid a lot more than the women do and the fact of the matter is that the women bring home more titles than the men a quote in the reading paid disparity in u.s soccer, that stood out to me is equal pay for equal work is this not a true statement just because the women's team are women and not men so in the end is it just sexism taking a tole.",1,NOT

this isint bulletproof like most people say at least in what is seen in this video alone the real takeaway at least the one i got is that wemen prefer eaiser less time consuming jobs to men the real question then becomes why why do they act this way if its simple biology then it seems as if even though a wage gap does exist its not due to any controllable factors but what if its for another reason what it wemen act this way beacuse of societys expectations if thats the case then there really is still work feminists have to do to make wemen feel more at ease in workplaces personally i think thats not supported at all from what we know about female biology but like she says there are so many variables and answers im not willing to count that argument 00 out yet.,1,NOT

the fact that this still has to be explained is just pathetic they never have answers for why companies don't hire more women if women get paid less than men they always talk about wanting to see more women in certain jobs but they're always these high paying low risk jobs it's never coal mining or working on off shore oil rigs or anything like that they go on and on about wanting to see more women in stem fields like there's some agenda by the patriarchy which doesn't exist to keep women out of those jobs it couldn't possibly be that women just don't want to go into those fields right they want to see women represented everywhere except the loudest hottest and most dangerous jobs because equality.,1,NOT

i have a small construction company and i know for a fact that i will get more productivity and therefore more profit out of male workers if the women could get the same amount of work done for less i would have no problem having a company full of them but in reality if i did that my company would probably go bankrupt and i'd have wild sexual harassment claims against me for telling them to work harder.,2,NOT

i worked in a predominantly male industry for over  years and made more money than most of the men and women in our group the reason why is because i was single and had no family commitments i was willing to work the long hours and do standby everyone else had family commitments they needed to pickup kids at daycare or go to a school event the women were always taking time off because their kids were sick and thus not dependable i found the women were always complaining about how they didn't get paid enough but were never able to admit that it was because they were unable to put in the extra work to get the raises they always wanted to blame it on sexism.,1,NOT

here are some factors on why men tend to earn more men choose higher paying jobs women tend to focus on jobs caring for others teachers nurses daycare home health workers etc...while men enjoy stem fields which are higher paying men put in more hours at work than women do and therefore are earning more if paid by the hour or earn more in commissions for making more sales because men put in more hours and maybe work nights and weekends they get more experience and are therefore more valuable which justifies pay raises and promotions women often leave the workforce to have kids this means that when/if they return they have to start from scratch while the men who were hired originally with the women have been promoted women aren't as aggressive in negotiating their pay when hired and/or promoted nor are they as aggressive in seeking/demanding promotions women are more likely to stay with a company that turned them down for a raise/promotion they are risk adverse men are less afraid of risk and will look elsewhere if they are passed over for a promotion or are denied a raise companies know this and therefore are more likely to give men that raise/promotion rather than face the higher risk of them leaving since women work less than men companies aren't going to offer women promotions if the promotion would require them to work longer hours women won't accept such promotions as often as men and the companies know that she is likely to turn it down so they offer it to the equally qualified man rather than having the man knowing that he was the nd choice since women tend to seek husbands who earn more than they do women are much more likely to have a higher earning spouse than a man this means that the women will be less likely to accept a promotion requiring more time/travel since she may not need the money as much as the man with a lower earning spouse the woman's husband is also less likely to accept the wife being on the job more hours and he will also be less willing to move if the woman's promotion requires it he may not be able to make the same money if the new town while the spouse of the male employee will be much more likely to find similar paying work these factors discourage women from accepting such promotions and knowing this the company is also less likely to offer it to a woman over an equally qualified man women with higher earning husbands feel less pressure to enter less attractive but higher paying fields they gravitate to jobs that they like men tend to have lower earning spouses and therefore are forced to choose higher paying jobs even if it's much less enjoyable all of the above show why men on an annual basis earn more than women there is nothing that attributes the difference to sexism it's all about personal choices that men and women freely make.,2,NOT
if this video took a look at if there was equal opportunities for women to actually get the higher paying jobs i think the consensus that prageru came to would have been different,1,NOT
it should be called an earnings gap which basically comes down to women wanting to be paid for the traditionally free labour they provided at home before entering the work force the left needs to stop insisting that there is a gender wage gap and the right like this video needs to stop saying that everything is equal because it isn't,1,NOT

i know i'm gonna sound like a complete idiot to all the people who believe this video but you're just basing everything on a video that has no sources to what they're saying and people say that all the butthurt feminists disliked this let me just clarify i'm a male not trans bi gay or anything like that before i'm gonna hear any excuse on why i'm wrong for being a feminist that wants more than just equality one point that i see is not very believable is that it has to do with career choices i'm pretty sure no matter the career choice a person makes there is always a man at that job that you can compare the money gap in unless we're talking about strippers those are separated) if they just based it on all women then yes of course the money amount would be less but it's not about the career choice it's about the money that a man and woman makes on the same job not on the career choice of both genders some countries the wage gap is almost not even there but i've had this explained by people who aren't females just say i'm making this shit up for all i care i just want to get my statement across.,1,NOT

i commented once before and it's going to sound like i'm saying this hostile and i'm not at all but you telling her how this works how a transgender should be where you have stated in a past video you still have your penis and what have you down there because you would mourn the loss so does that mean you're not fully transgender you still want to hold on to some male parts because you would mourn the loss so obviously you don't know exactly how it works either i don't either but apparently it's still open for debate what transgender is and what it isn't and how many genders there are so again not with any animus at all here but who gives you the right to say she's not doing it right and you're doing it right not a hater just wondering why you feel you're an expert at it because you have a lot of followers would love to hear a true answer and not somebody cussing me out you want to be accepted like everyone else and be a normal person i got it but here you're squashing someone else who obviously is got issues and isn't dealing with it well but at least trying to express it i don't think you should be jumping down on a lost soul what gives you the right to say what the fuck that's not how it works ,2,NOT

mancheeze the great made a video on ya you should respond to the terf,2,NOT
i agree with most of the things said in here and btw you are beautiful but when people come out as whatever they want to come out as wether it's trans bisexual gay etc. they don't necessarily have to talk about it 4/7 some people are more shy and like to keep their sexuality as something personal especially big actors like jaden smith and some youtubers so sometimes they just want to let their fanbase know more about them and just because they announced it does not mean that they have to mention their sexuality in every conversation ya feel but hey that's just my opinion i definitely think that trish is either a troll or that she genuinely needs help.,3,NOT

female body builders still wear super effeminate clothing and makeup even though people would say not me to be clear they look like men top beauty gurus and makeup artists out here are men......... we're at the precipice of stopping conformity purely by gender/sexuality and then trisha has to sit on her kitchen floor and talk a load on nonsense because she can't be bothered to take her money and go see a therapist to work all that out.,5,ABU
she's always looking for attention and she loves to make everything about her i don't hate her but i don't understand how people like that kind of content. ,3,NOT

"question for blaire when i hear the term transgender"" and of course the first person i think about is you i find the term no longer applies to you as far as i can tell you've finished your transformation meaning you're no longer a m2f transitioner and anything else you do be it oh idk.. liposuction nose job bigger titty implants anything short of the salami slice none of those things except the last which i selectively put a condition on are going to create a secondary sex characteristic that you don't already have i mean you're gorgeous and you know it let's not bullshit with each other reason i say this is because some of these other unicorn genders were see like justin dennis non-binary trans woman bullshit or any of the other transtrender assholes you've dissected in your videos there certainly have been a lot of them they wouldn't qualify as trans either since they are making a declaration of an imaginary gender and have no intention on transitioning to a male or a female meaning the term trans is a meaningless word which i must say is not only offensive to my intelligence but should be offensive to your integrity as a transitioned male to female... i'll just call you female from here on but i think you get what i mean... if not i'll clarify.",2,NOT

i subscribed thank you for your content you help educate me in ways that people think are impossible i've been saying celebs coming out with all of their different identifications has been for clout but everyone likes slapping me with the homophob or sexist tags when i'm genuinely just like these celebs are doing it for clout,2,NOT
i already had lunch but all that food is making me hungry again!,1,NOT
4:4 i think she meant that's something she struggles with as a woman when women are assertive its wrongly seen as being a bitch it's a very common problem in workplaces but when men are assertive it's just normal conversation it's in the same realm as women being told to smile more but you'd never say that to a man sooooo annoying.,2,NOT

she's not trans but that would only mean she has another mental illness i genuinely think she's confused and tries to find her identity she doesn't have the vocabulary to express herself and that's why she's contradicting herself you can't cancel a human being.. she feels fluid and that's why she needs a therapist she doesn't have to apologise for her confusion just like we shouldn't believe her and we shouldn't think she lies because we don't know imagine if she's right then all of the hate right now is suicide fuel for her.,5,ABU
by trisha's definition i too am a gay man... ,2,NOT

oh trisha you have to hand it to her she is very entertaining it's like watching your dysfunctional friend mess up time and time again.,5,ABU
i believe it could be that she's been so traumatized by men in her life that she thinks if she becomes one it will fix her pain i also think she might be in love with her gay best friend she's been known to transform into whatever the guy she's interested wants she's admitted she's very prone to obsessing over things.,2,NOT
so being transgender has less to do with sexual orientation and more with the feeling that you were born in the wrong body all the terms that are currently being used describe sexual preference sexual identity etc have me extremely confused i often feel like i require a handbook to help me grasp the most recent celebrity coming out.,2,NOT

blair can you answer a question are for me why is it that most trans women seem that they do not respect the space of natural born women and why don't they want there own space i think it is very disrespectful and insulting to all women that trans women think that have the right to say they are real women cause the fact remains they are not it seems they don't even have pride in being trans they want to be a natural women but will not and can not ever be no disrespect it's just fact common sense thanks for your time.,5,ABU
unfortunately trisha is being a troll i'm so confused how people still even find her relevant this is exactly what she wanted everyone to do she has admitted so many times that she says these things to be a troll and have people make these videos and certainly not saying you shouldnt have bc i love all of your videos i'm just glad you uploaded anything lmao but.. i wish people would stop giving her what she wants so she can just sink into her vile little hole shes not a good person imo.,5,ABU

um..i think this along with most of her issues stem fm a deep deep seeded childhood trauma/issue im a firm believer in freud's theory that children's personalities develope through the stages freud proposed that psychological development in childhood takes place during five psychosexual stages oral anal phallic latency and genital i think something happened during trisha's early childhood...around or yrs old and im not saying sexual abuse though im not ruling that out.. but something happened and that's why she has no self control..her id gets what her id wants she has stated she needs sex to times a day that she just pulsates for no reason and needs sex often she goes into self destruction mode when in a relationship and fm the start of a relationship starts pushing that person away while at the same time being super ultra clingy..has talked about her drug use her drinking her eating addiction...her impulsivity..her being attractive to way older men.. and i think it all goes back to her early childhood i just wonder what the fuck her therapist talks to her about?!? she needs a doctor to delve into her mind..not just a therapist she needs a psychologist!,5,ABU

i agree luv trisha but im finding myself slowly moving away from her with all do respect if she truly is with i think she isn't at the moment transgender... i will support her unconditionally but using the trans community for views and attention is never okay and it is something trisha is prone to doing jumping onto trends and saying random ass shit for views.. xyz. but at the end of the day nobody defines the transgender every body is different and responds to figuring themselves out in a different way there are male to female straight women male to female gay women male to female a+ and the exact same for female to male she has every right to come out... but definitely has no right to use being trans for growth it truly can be either or we all know nothing is yet to be confirmed i know this is all over the place but i just don't know how to explain my opinion in another way than this in conclusion..... we'll see.,3,NOT

i don't know why people take her so seriously it's clear she's a troll she's admitted to being a troll but people continue to make reaction videos to her strange statements which is the exact attention she wants.,3,NOT
to be fair trisha has been known for trolling her audience for views!,3,NOT
every time trisha gets kinda irrelevant she makes a weird video and she becomes relevant again if crying on the kitchen floor doesn't work anymore she suddenly becomes transgender -d haha brilliant!,3,NOT
she's at it again ughhh ,3,NOT
i think trisha might truly need to take a look at her mental health.,5,ABU

first of all if you know trisha you know that she is definitely just shitposting and unfortunately for her it's completely blown up and gone too far and now she's cant turn back without being completely cancelled second of all i find it shocking the way the lgbtq community prestigious members of the community have reacted to the news the way most people have reacted to her completely contradicts to what they normally preach about transgender people they will allow predators to convince themselves and others that they can get periods and pms even though they have male genitalia but when a known troll comes out suddenly they're offended i know trisha just as well as the next person but what if she actually does have gender dysphoria and this is how the hypocrites that are social justice warriors react if anything she's exposing the hypocrisy within the lgbtq online community.,3,NOT
i am so shook i was literally in the process of commenting you need to do a reacting to gigi gorgeous reaction and there it was,1,NOT

blair i just want to say a few things one i didn't know anything about you until i seen a video you did about yaniv when i seen that video i started watching a lot of your other videos you opened my eyes to transgenders and it is solely you why i am able to accept the transition and why transgenders do so at first i was afraid for my daughters using public bathrooms for fear of them seeing a man urinating in a urinal because of you i realized that would probably never happen and it alleviated my fear and it grew acceptance in my heart when you denounced yaniv which was my worst nightmare as a mother of three girls i instantly respected you for calling it out and how much you went out of your way and even put yourself in danger to hold yaniv accountable i fell in love with you because of that not love as in romantic but love as in the way i love my family and children i have agreed with you on every video you have done including this one i love candace owens and i agreed with both of you but i had to admit you held your own with her which is hard for a lot of people and you eloquently stood firm to your beliefs thank you for being you and explaining yourself and your thoughts the way you do in my eyes you have paved the way for people like me who don't quite understand the transgender transformations to understand and even able to lovingly accept everyone you are truly a lovely woman and keep shining your light and love to the world!,1,NOT

thank you for pointing out that even if she's trolling she's actually speaking and acting the way many many people do earnestly i can't remember that little creature that was riley dennis's friend but she popped to mind so many girls act like this and as someone who used to read a lot of yaoi comics online a lot of the female creators transitioned.. simply because they fetishized gay guys it's actually a thing that happens but some of them end up doing the whole testosterone thing which is really unhealthy and then detransition huge waste of time and resources also thank you for not claiming to actually be a real girl other trans people i watched try to claim this that they were real men despite being born women and trisha was not like honey why did you have to transition then i love you and your channel because you don't deny the reality of your birth and existence and i think that makes you happier in your own way than other trans people who cannot accept the reality of their situations.,2,NOT

maybe the actual issue should be that those low paying jobs should not be so low paying sadly they actual contribute a similar amount to society as any of the high paying jobs...,2,NOT
sooooooooo the wage gap myth is proof that girls are worse at math?,5,ABU
wait so they said taking into account choice the gap is only . cents so does mean there still is a gap then just smaller?,1,NOT
i think the root of the problem is not the pay gap but the pressures and norms of women to be in the types of jobs that pay less and men in the types of jobs that pay more so there is an inequality but the root problem is in how we raise kids and even subconsciously push them towards different careers society shouldn't discourage men and women from jobs just because it's not normal for their gender.,1,NOT
anyone has credible sources about it not denying it on the contrary),1,NOT
i like how feminist portray the freedom of choice but do not actually look into the meaning of choice why focus on something that hasn't been researched properly and bark with claims plus men have a psychological burden of having a job however women do not have that burden,5,ABU
graet video..thanks prager university..facts by crhistine..make us to wake up and share with others..,2,NOT

the fact that this was said by a women shows how fake the wage cap is lol,2,NOT
so women really want us to take away their choices fine by me.,2,NOT
literally just look at the equal pay act,1,NOT
i agree there is no wage gap however this also ignores that while yes women lean to lower paying jobs for a women in a male dominated field it can be very discouraging and uncomfterable turning many women from picking that feild there is no wage gap but women are discouraged from many high paying desgrees not intentionally but rather just because a girl in a sausage fest is bound to feel uncomfortable.,2,NOT
i find it sexist how my career in gender studies doesn't pay me enough as someone who is a doctor,2,NOT

i hope i never meet the k people that disliked this,2,NOT
chances of it ever being .000000 between the two genders is unlikely there always will be a wage gap it might be in favour of men and it may also be in favour of women the wage gap is a good thing as it shows that men and women make different choices based on their gender derived strengths and not because they make up the perfect ratio to appease idiots looking for .000000 gap.,3,NOT
feminists needs to start closing the huge wage gap between male and female models sex workers and porn stars the gap can range form 0 to 00 in favor of the women !!! come on feminists get your feminism is for both men and women on this.,2,NOT
if only countries governments and institutions could address their social problems in this manner they might end up at least moving in the right direction discussing problems like this might not guarantee an ideal solution but it certainly paves way for improvement and helps reducing redundancies,1,NOT
i don't know how people can dislike this video but i guess i shouldn't be surprised when the left can't understand facts.,3,NOT
5.1k people understand that the title of this video is a blatant lie if you actually watch the video.,2,NOT
"these are facts i'm willing to stand with research has backed the claims given in the video plus a bit of common sense thrown in to boot if the wage gap is  cents why don't employers hire only women?""",2,NOT
i was thinking the same thing like why can't an experiment be done where men and women work the exact same job and hours do the exact same things in the workrelated area for a month or so then compare wages without the employer being aware of the experiment) and then see it they got the same amount of money or not if there is a difference between their wages then something is up otherwise the wage gap isn't a sexist thing,2,NOT
now you notice not many hate comments on this video because they know its right,2,NOT
there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap that could be solved through just working more hours.,2,NOT
what is also funny is that paying women less is illegal so it wouldn't even be possible like some feminists suggest.,3,NOT
you never take into account what directs the choice of the people women are not sent signals that they can be engineers explorers or have an open world of careers for them i am not trying to sound like some liberal hippy but the it is evident that exposure to certain elements will influence your thought process from a young age women are given easy-bake ovens and fashion barbies while men are given tool sets and cars while yes you are the one who chooses your career but you are not in control of what products are placed in front of you your whole like that direct you towards who you become therefore there is still oppression with these gender roles also i am sure there is a misconception about females making 0.7 to every 1.0 and this video does a good job on clearing up some of the math) unfortunately i don't know that much about that topic so i won't put in my 0.3 cents on where i stand on it maybe that joke was a bit tasteless.),3,NOT
woman and men have different values.,3,NOT
nice and eye-opening thanks i'm also years late but apparently that's how youtube recommendations work. on the other hand even if 9 of the worse paying majors were male i still would like to see teachers early childhood educators included) psychologist and social workers earn more there is no sexism in this wish either just the thing that these people do a lot to individuals and in my opinion should be valued more this claim that women chooose to study things that lead to lower wages sounded a bit like blaming women for earning averagely somewhat less but then who would do these jobs also if some men didn't do the dangerous jobs who would trust me there are men who would never work on an oil rig and there are women who would never even touch an elderly gentleman or lady or care for them professionally if they can't do this on their own i forgot the word for the home where they live then. no i do not compare these jobs and you should neither do that because they are enterily different and not comparable i would like to add the situation in my country beginner teachers earn circa 628/65 usd per month without the taxes nurses or social workers who work with the elderly or homeless for example earn even less i now simply don't trust my owm calculations because it seems so few like - dollars/hour compared to american wages yes things are a bit cheaper there and we have free universities but my point is that these people do not earn enough money regardless of their gender. edit for correction of sentence-structures i struggle with english.),2,NOT
some of the proclaimed pay-gab is said to be because the mommy penalty' a woman that choose to get a kid will drop in income because of that but here is the thing you women don't need to get kids right no one is forcing you and you can live the life as a man if you please men can not get children by them-self so i would say that men are worse off in men will never reproduce in their life but its only in for women.,3,NOT
praise this woman!,1,NOT
good job as always christina!,1,NOT
hears feminist automatically dislikes,2,NOT
i've known for years the gender pay gap was made up and was disappointed when obama talked it up but u say in the video the aauw took into account choice found a wage gap and then still go on to say it's about choice i believe the main point but treat us like adults and get into the . cent wage gaps nuts and bolts also this woman is a race traitor.,5,ABU
as an egalitarian i highly appreciate this video because it gives me a clearer understanding of this whole wage gap situation i'm constantly told that it's real and that it's not real so this justifies my confusion.,2,NOT
because you can't have a good old boy network with outold boys keep up the work of republican facist propaganda you obviously have never had a job or your a business owner yes your gender is a problem why isn't a man doing this report this college must be sponsored by nazi's.,5,ABU
i'm sorry but you're legitimately wrong i know multiple woman including my mother who work longer hours than the people in the same company but that's lower on the totem poll and make significantly less as in thousands of dollars per year less nice try but you're not fooling anyone that isn't already brain dead.,3,NOT
the only thing i wanna see is higher pay towards education that would be a cool thing to see,1,NOT
also the fact that women give birth and want to raise their family means they have to sacrifice a high end job or full time hours in order to be with her family and raise them they can work part time maximum if they want to actually have time for their family life is all about making sacrifices if you are working in a high end job you often sacrifice your family time and free time if you are working a small part time job you are sacrificing your income in order to have more free time and family time women generally prefer doing the latter women who have children who are working full time or in high end jobs are constantly giving their children to nannies to look after they don't have proper time to spend with their own children and raise them it's unfair on the children.,2,NOT
simple truth men in same jobs do not make same pay either this is fact this is called negotiation men do not force their employers to pay equal to compensate for their varying negotiating ability save for strikes and union representation if women want true equality they just have to learn to negotiate better without coercion of the law or using their feminine character in any way learn to play the game they so desperately wish to a be a part of in a truly fair way.,3,NOT
basically when you put in all the factors there is an actual gender wage gap but it's not as big as the general number that some people use equality is a long continuous battle that has gone on through history and will continue until everyone is totally and completely equal there will always be assholes and sexist out there same for racist but if we can change ourselves we can work to make that number smaller we do not live in a post feminist world just because we have the right to vote does not mean we have equality i think that should be noted and understood that it's the general mindset that we need to change.,2,NOT
"""common sense"" sign i can't believe that we can't even use this word easily damn postmodernism.",3,NOT
preach it sister.,1,NOT
this video has a point but it doesn't tell the whole story often traditionally female fields are paid less because they are mostly women also women are less likely to ask for a pay raise partially bc they are more likely to be looked on as pushy or aggressive than a man would be it is often harder for women to get to higher level positions that pay more because they aren't viewed as as good leaders and male bosses and even as a few studies have shown other women may discriminate against women when giving promotions many high paying male dominated fields also have problems with sexual harassment silicon valley is a good example which obviously discourages female workers the problem is not companies deliberately paying women less it is that it is harder for women to get into higher paying fields,2,NOT
i can't believe this wage gap myth is still going on,3,NOT
you already admitted that when you control for all the factors you listed there is still a wage gap you just proved that the wage gap exists and that it's not explainable in economic terms you also left out institutional barriers to working in higher paid positions the argument that businesses would higher more women if the wage gap existed ignore that if women are viewed as being less valuable then they will be paid less.,2,NOT
this is so stupid no wonder its from the same website that denies humans are causing climate change,3,NOT
wasn't this lady one of the guest that spoke with milo and crowder if so she is honestly what all feminist should aspire to be like.,2,NOT
men are more likely to pick high paying jobs and women are more likely to pick low paying jobs within the statistics provided in the video) from that you could say that the higher paying jobs are more masculine and less feminine because of the choices females and males are more likely to make on average representing the different mind sets than the lower paying jobs and that our society tends to benefit masculine qualities over feminine qualities as a whole determined from those statistics also the title there is no gender wage gap is very misleading when the video proceeds to explain why there is a gender wage gap this argument comes across as very counter-intuitive one last thing genders occurred in our species long before we formed a currency in which to reward each other for jobs doesn't it seem strange we have worked ourselves into a situation as a species in which occupations that are mostly male dominated are going to get rewarded more than female dominated occupations over the duration of time we have been evolving with these delicate and influential minds problems like these have inevitably been emphasised and expanded from our initial nature and we should probably fix it.,2,NOT

hmm.. it's blantantly ignorant to say that there is no pay gap i mean it's clear that the average woman does make less than the average man but it's not anyone's fault but the women who are making the choices that are holding them back from economic success there's many variables and traits that exist within this  cents to the dollar thing the largest ones but not the only ones being mother hood the fact that women choose lower paying jobs and competitiveness so while i agree with the statistics that feminists just need to stop bitching because nothing can be done to put more money in their wallets because it's already illegal to pay people more or less based on discriminations such as race or sex but the message that the gap isn't real is just going against facts they're not really anyone's fault but they are facts women make less than men fact of life quit having children and work more maybe you'll make the same amount.,5,ABU

earning less and being paid less are two totally different things.,1,NOT
i think that woman got less and still in many places get less wages cause there is a certain mindset that women don't have as much as the caliber as a man also woman come with a load of baggage as in child care which is alone too much for a business to handle that is why women are not chosen for jobs everytime it is practical for men to be chosen for businesses but this neglects woman who want to work the system is filled with holes maybe the problem is not present in your region but nothing in the world is regional we can find many cases of wage gap in many places i don't believe i'm a toxic feminist or anything so if you want to argue let us do it politelyüòä,1,NOT

after seeing some comments regarding the maternity leave i have something to say if you care enough to read things changed so much in the last  years many developed countries have not only maternity leave but paternity leave as well so usually the woman is the first who takes that leave to recover from labor/operation and to breastfeed if they have milk but more and more women choose not to breastfeed or they simply don't have milk children's health doesn't suffer much from this factor actually) then it's the dad who takes a leave and women usually leave enough milk at home so that dad could take care of the child there is no reason why he can't if you think about it for example in finland you see as many dads as moms walking in the park with their newborns for that reason so there is no reason for that gap you people are referring to btw statistics tells us that in the past couple of decades more and more dads take a sick leave to take care of a sick child in europe it's not only on women anymore spouses are finally a team with equally shared responsibilities after all very few families might afford for one of the parents to stay home to take care of children/home because of today's economics so this gap even if it exists should disappear completely in the near future there is no guarantee for a business if they hire a man he isn't the one who will take care of children when they get sick and not to hire a childless woman only because in the future she might have children is not practical at all after all men are physically stronger but women's health and endurance is better and they live longer in almost all of the countries easy statistics to look up) they fall sick rarer and take more care of their health and if they are valuable to the business there is no reason not to hire them if they are more suitable to the position and there is absolutely no justified motivation to pay them less even if they take one or two maternity leaves during their career men will take as many months to take care of their health when they fall sick or their children will and it is beautiful if you ask me children have both parents equally present there is no better thing for them i hope these facts are enough for you to realize why there is completely no base at the decision why to pay women less for the same work there is no way for companies to predict the future of the employee no matter the gender.,1,NOT
notice how the lowest paying vocations are all caring professions which are all stereotypically womens work if there was no gender pay gap the lowest paid jobs would be brought in line with the highest paying jobs but unfortunately womens work is not valued and therefore not paid well men have more freedom in their choices to relocate and work long hours because it is traditionally the woman who takes care of the other responsibilities so that he may provide for the family' unless of course he has none of those extra family related responsibilities caring for ageing parents children cooking cleaning other stereotypical womens work).. this video literally goes on to say that people without responsibilities who can be at the business beck and call will be favoured because it suits the business and who in society has the least responsibility to caring men traditionally they're job is to provide and protect which in this era translates to bring in the money' this video is a contradiction of itself.,2,NOT

there isn't a gender wage gap there is a flaw in the age wage system though someone who's 8-2 will receive less per hour because of their age and everyone 5 are entitled to more how so some 9-2 year olds have houses kids etc and some people over  don't some younger people may put more effort in and don't doze about like some over 5s do but because of their age they're paid less or more so much mucking about how about paying more based on experience effort and responsibility rather than their age then there's noncewood and indoctrination centres known as schools and most braindead politicians the ones that don't live in the real world just have beans and crisps and shut up you hypocritical virtue signalling nonces greed that's all it comes down to today and why we have such a dysfunctional system that affects many people especially younger).,2,NOT

but what about the fact that men are more often considered for promotions that identical resumes with the only difference being gender result in the female being offered lower pay or flat out rejected why is it that the national women's soccer team pulled in more views on their world cup victory but was paid a fraction of the men's team who didn't even come close obviously theirs a lot of factors that come into all these calculations and a lot of good points are raised in this video such as the dangerous work conditions but i think with the information accessible it is still hard to discern where the issue lies women are more likely to be stay at home parents whereas boys are often more encouraged to pursue these high paying careers likewise that men are more willing to work longer hours and are very possibly more qualified i believe that their might still be a gender wage gap at play but its a lot more complex than a lot of people put it out to be in my opinion more research and information should be gathered in order to finally put this question to rest.,2,NOT

women choosing career that requires nurturing compassion is 00 okay it's their choice feminazis should never demonize them just because they chose what they love to do although i will argue that most of these hard working women deserves more i mean example teachers family councilors nurses these women are the people who shape our children who in turn will shape our future they help us a lot to make the families which is the core of our society intact their impact in our society is not as obvious but they do play a big important role in developing it so yes they deserve more maybe not in the same way as doctors or engineers or lawyers because these professions require a lot more technical skills but they do deserve a better standard of living in our society.,2,NOT

you know i think its not there is a gender wage gap or there is no gender wage gap its something in between only looking at the average income is of course pretty dumb it does not account for so much for instance more women staying at home however just brushing the whole thing off is not fair there have been actual studies that compare women and men with equal jobs qualifications and work time it showed that women actually earm  ct per dollar a man earns im no die hard sjw communist or whatever but brushing somethinf off from both sides as not existent or overexagerate is not too smart if youre interested in this go watch david pakmans video on gender pay gap.,2,NOT

convoluted logic untested then becomes fantasy and distortion you state that there is no gender wage gap and then state that the gap is small then you justify the wage gap we can argue about how small and justifiable the gap is but first we need to know how you can state something that just isn't true in the first place this is just the old evangelical trick of providing lie to people who don't want to be called liars.,2,NOT
still the questions remains why do women make those different choices? a lot of those choices in college major number of hours worked etc. are influenced by the fact that women are still expected to be homemakers even if both parents work full-time countless studies show that when a mother and father both work mom does the majority of the housework and child-rearing this could partly be due to biology where women are more inclined to nurture their children giving you the benefit of the doubt but it is undoubtedly largely thanks to societal pressure and cultural norms.,2,NOT

this is all correct but take in factors such as social pressures it is more expected for a women to give up work temporarily or permanently in order to take care of their children which is unfair on both women and men also a company is more likely to promote a man over a women especially if she is of the age where most women have children because maternity leave is expensive for companies to deal with again i believe that this is unfair i think that a way to reduce the gender pay gap is to increase the length of paternity leave to the length of maternity leave not only to eradicate the inequality but also so that a man can have the necessary time with his child,1,NOT

"you know what people keep focusing on the different pay for the same job thing but they're missing a bigger picture men in america i'm not sure about elsewhere) can drop out of high school join a union where they get paid while they train get full benefits and really good wages they can learn these trades from their dad uncle anyone really while they grow up and have a job that pays them really well right at the start of their life my dad knows how to do all kinds of skilled trades but if i tried to ask him what he working on he'd say i was in his light and tell me to go play he's teaching my little brother about fixing cars of course and i'm glad when i graduated i got a job as a housekeeper at days inn i was paid based on the number of rooms i was assigned to clean and given  minutes to clean them after that times up i'm working for free i made 5.2 an hour and worked my ass off but made at most 12 a week working full time then i got job after job making  at the most women's work doesn't pay well it just doesn't so i thought i wanna make money like the guys do i'll work hard i'm not scared of labor and went to school for welding turns out i loved it looooved it i loved every part of my job in and of itself however i didn't love the harassment and bullying i had to deal with i wasn't walking in with a pink helmet and crying girl power or anything ridiculous i wore sports bras a jumpsuit and made a point to be polite to everyone i crossed paths with while keeping to myself and staying out of any nonsense it turns out even if i keep to myself and try to not start any drama when you're the only woman in a building with over 0 men someone some jerk will have a problem with you based solely on the fact they think you shouldn't be there that one jerk will multiply quickly then you find the guys you thought were your friends coming up and telling you i hate what's happening to you it's not right you're a hard worker and you do a great job but i just want you to know that i'll never defend you you'll be gone eventually they'll make sure of it and i'll be the next target if i do"" point is they say well women can do those jobs now too if they want to and while that's true and not every woman's experience it was for me i'm not talking about being flirted with either i can handle that i had a manger from a department that was totally unrelated to mine slamming his breaks in front of me on the highway and trying to drive me into a wall over and over leaving work one day i didn't even know who it was or why it was happening until the next day when i saw him get out of the same car no road rage cutting anyone off riding anyone's ass type of thing that's just one example out of many i can give forget about the unequal pay for the same job part where's the union with paid training for women's work"" i mean it sounds almost stupid to say out loud but where's the cleaners union or the secretaries union or whatever job women are supposedly naturally good at"" the other day i paid a guy 12 to hook up my internet he was hours late it took him  minutes i gave him a beer and a taco to go home with he seriously showed up at  pm) i cleaned someone's house the other day for 60 the lady had small children she homeschooled and the house was a disaster i felt bad for her and wound up spending most of my money on supplies/gas and it took hours to clean it was a waste of time honestly but no one seems to think anything of paying women basically nothing when they hire them but pay an electrician or plumber astronomically more money that's the problem no one questions that when women were originally allowed to work they typically had husband's that made the money and the women just supplemented the income so it wasn't a big deal to pay women less but we're still living on that base model today and people aren't getting married after high school now i'm  and single and take care of myself it's not like that anymore.",2,NOT
glad to see that there are still some sane democrats in the world such as christina.,3,NOT
i despise most social workers they only help women and condemn innocent men.,5,ABU
people realize that the wage gap isn't representative of two people with the same exact job the problem with the wage gap is that women are stuck into traditionally lower paying jobs based on systematic oppression and irrational gender stereotypes it's not communism it's a culture still recovering from political social and economic gender inequality.,2,NOT
youtube ads now redpilling people is this timeline a hologram?,2,NOT
ben shapiro destroy sjw with fact!!,3,NOT
why are they still pushing this agenda the pay gap has been debunked time and time again yet there is a trending topic about it on google and youtube.,2,NOT
i want to show this to my mother and all feminists but they'll just say that's not true or something like that,2,NOT
thank you for trying to find all the facts.,2,NOT
so nowwe have proof men are smarter and make more hahaha women have children so that's 01 the rest is just because women don't do the same job.,5,ABU
this is face-palm inducingly obvious i can't believe we're still talking about this.. anyone who is honest with themselves about the biological differences between men and women and their priorities men are ambitious status seeking women are all about relating to others will get it without issue only the biology deniers eg those who think women are as strong as men will continue to push this dumb narrative re wage gap.,3,NOT
the myth is still being pushed that she had to do a second video.,1,NOT
why don't businesses hire only women because the majority of women takes maternity leave so businesses wouldn't have any employees.. isn't that obvious??,2,NOT
but don't they make as much because stereotypes convince or force them to do less paying jobs,1,NOT
guys why do we get restricted its almost as if we are opposing everything this company is going for.,2,NOT
so she blatantly ignores the fact that not all of those were choices maybe some of the woman in lower paying jobs wanted something that paid more but were rejected because they were female maybe sexism lies more in the people with the duty of hiring rather than the people who give out wages.,2,NOT
sooo what you are saying is that actually women are stupid and take all the wrong decisions or or wait you are saying that there is a gene in the y chromosome that allows men only to work long hours without notice really... is there a study to prove such a thing or you just thought of it and if this is the case after all and let's say that all the gender wage gab is created by choices why women feel compelled to make choices like these is society driving them is it the fact that they are the only humans that can actually reproduce the species or maybe we should change that let's stop reproducing since it all boils down to choices because being the only one capable of giving birth is a choice sure thing and by the way call your mother and inform her that as a woman she is not willing to work long hours without notice i am sure she will have a few things to say about that good day!,5,ABU
teachers should be paid more because they might just have one of the most important and difficult jobs in the nation just think about how many kids with behavioral issues they have to help and the decisions they make that impact the future generations!!,1,NOT
aaaaannnnnnnnnndddddddddddd now i am gonna keep this in a playlist for when wage gap arguments cone up.,2,NOT
not to mention most of the incredibly rich people in the us are men celebrities ceo's etc all making above 00k a year drastically impacts the average.,1,NOT
let me guess feminists this woman is being held captive by the patriarchy?,3,NOT
wtf thats a big difference in pay!,2,NOT
this video titled there is no wage gap admitted a quarter through the video that a . cent wage gap exists...,2,NOT
maybe the best paying majors are mostly male because women can't get into those fields because of sexism in the job field.,2,NOT
i absolutely love this,1,NOT
the equal pay act of 96 makes it illegal to underpay a gender checkmate feminists,2,NOT
very well done christina you rock xoxo,1,NOT
feminists bitch about being paid less than men okay well maybe if you got a job in any of the fields that men typically work in e.g mining construction railroads etc then you would have the same pay rate i don't think that some lady who works at a hotel reception or hair salon should make the same as a man who is up to his elbows in shit to fix a broken pump at a sewage treatment plant.,5,ABU
"the sadest part of this video is a woman saying this isn't sexism its common sense""",2,NOT
i actually took the time to read the georgetown university study and can confirm that the data presented in this video is 00 accurate to explain the .6 difference  men are more willing to work overtime  women take more time off maternity leave)  women are less likely to ask for a raise  other variables.,2,NOT
i just want to shove this video in every feminists face every stupid feminist out there protesting instead of working should have this video plastered on her face and forced to listen to it times.,5,ABU
yeah yeah their personal career choices but what if some women are forced to make these choices women can't avoid having children can they and if women want to take care of their children then they'll probably need to take more time off work than men.,2,NOT
is this humour category ,2,NOT
oh my gosh thank you!,1,NOT
liked reposted keep up the awesomeness!,1,NOT
"my family keeps trying to make me think the gap is real i keep telling them this and the only thing they have to defend themselves is no it's real""",1,NOT

these are the alternative facts folks seems legit...,2,NOT
i am not sure if prager u is conservative or neutral though i am fine either way because i am conservative and i agree there is no wedge gap!,2,NOT
this is a great woman,1,NOT
there is no gender wage gap only in as much as women do half the hours men do but want the same pay,3,NOT
if a woman tells you that they earn less than a man for doing the same job just ask them to give you an example‚Ä¶..and that will be it.,3,NOT
and apparently in the 900s when women did have lower pay than men women eventually took over those jobs,2,NOT
so the problem is getting woman into the fields that they want to work in and give them opportunities to choose specialties work more hours etc til they're making what they want to be making as long as that is achieved that's what matters,1,NOT
this is such bull shit üòÇüòÇ,2,NOT
last year during my senior year of highschool we had a test in my economics class one of the questions was what are the reasons for the gender wage gap i wrote that is doesnt exist my teacher failed me,2,NOT
this why i don't join feminized because i don't want to be a villain like those women.,5,ABU
3.6k fat sexually frustrated feminists who didn't get their morning donuts watched this video,2,NOT
this is so true.,1,NOT
ugh yes we know this already it's the reason why this happens we are trying to solve i think that it has to do with the facts that what is considered normal/typical jobs for men and women and what is considered normal comes from the old gender strereotypes that lead us it's easier to be normal i'll give an example i'm a woman who's always been interested on woodworks in elementary school i had to decide if i go to sewing classes or woodworking i wanted to go to woodworking but since i was really shy and all my friends went to sewing classes i followed them things like these leads to less experience and makes chances to get to your chosen school/jobs etc worse well thankfully things aren't that bad in my country and i did get into a carpenter school now getting a job is a different story d,2,NOT
can we raise awareness of this channel?,2,NOT
coming from a women i'm way happier why can't society understand as a  year old i totally understand why women protest and stuff like that but i know for sure they don't know how to fix it.,1,NOT
this ignores so many things.. both sides ignore many things just one example man work more paid hours women work more unpaid hours they have to work at home and take care of the children that is an inequality.,2,NOT
but surely we should be asking the question of why women are making these worse career choices and why women are worse educated?,3,NOT
"the gender wage gap has been debunked so many times it's sad that people have to keep coming out and saying this over and over again while the landwhale feminaizis just plug their ears and yell patriarchy!""",5,ABU

this myth will never die people who want to believe that their failures are due to a worldwide conspiracy will always gravitate towards myths like this.,2,NOT
male strippers make a lot less money than female strippers and female models make way more money than female models u don't hear men crying oppression and sexism,3,NOT
the thing i wanted to hear during this claim that it's not sexist but didn't) was why are the choices women make prefer) paid significantly less than the choices men make prefer) if someone answers that the fields men choose are more significant or important i'm going to throw something it appears that either society could care less about the caring for humanity fields or about paying higher wage for women dominated fields this is crucial but wasn't studied so the study is spurious.,2,NOT
"businesses hire men and give them more because they actually work more,causing them to have a higher pay.",1,NOT
i can't believe progressives are out and about denying literal facts*.. and yes they are facts check out my most recent video for more info,3,NOT
why would people dislike this feminist wow i hate this video because it shows women are the same as men,2,NOT
"the problem of men earning more than women can be solved easily and economically all are paid equal for the same work and although all are paid according to the women's tariff"" point of view women do not earn less but men get too much ! problem solved has anyone actually noticed that feminists like men want to be treated and behave like men they do not want to be feminine at the same time they criticize the behavior of the men total sickness ",5,ABU
one more comment female dominated jobs seem to reflect female's natural abilities as a result of having babies unfortunately when a couple i.e. a male and a female decides to have children it is usually the female's job that is sacrificed why because the male's job pays more was it the female's choice alone to have children so why does it always seem the female takes the hit career-wise?,2,NOT
you can't explain numbers to snowflakes and jigglypuffs they only care about emotions even if does emotions are more toxic than what they call toxic masculinity.,5,ABU
now you may wonder why jobs that are historicaly woman jobs have lower pay,3,NOT
i truly agree with the video there is no gender wage gap‚Äù i think having a wage gap is all mental a trick your mind plays because we see a large number of successful people being males an example from group presentation would be the magazine forbes this magazine is successful people and most of the people on their front cover have been males i has agree with there being no wage gap from the beginning of speaking about the topic but never thought of speaking out and giving my opining because i thought i would been criticized and be looked as a bias person the fallacies in the argument is just like said in the video and command sense and its all about the choices each gender makes its command sense because if a guy and a girl both work at mcdonald they are both getting paid minimum wage same amount of money for the hour but all depends who wants to work more and longer hours an example how choices is key to an argument like the wage gap would be the saying of females live longer this is because its usually the male who pull out ridiculous dangerous stunts that sometimes kill them its all in the choices one makes there is no difference on how much females and males get paid like the video there is no gender wage gap they explain how the number 7 out of dollar and that is just what average females make divided by what the average male makes all the factors that fall in to where the money goes people make counts too like said by the website the wage gap state by state that most families depend on the females overall it's the factors and choices one makes that make males look like they are getting paid more.,2,NOT
actually they do take into account occupation education and position another part of the wage gap is that men are more likely to get bonuses than women who work the same hours and are more likely to get promoted if a women tries to discuss/negotiate a higher salary then she is needy if a man does the same he's a leader.,2,NOT
the average high-school teacher earns less than the average ceo the teacher must be under oppression!,2,NOT

just a well made video the editing was fantastic the woman in the video was great for the roll very nice,2,NOT
this is incredibly misleading because women make choices of professions that are mother and family friendly and these professions are not as valued in our us capitalist society as are others to where men flock due to higher wages prestige and power.,2,NOT

the fact that women earn  cents for every dollar that a man makes for the same work is bs however let's look at why women make those choices how dod people perceive a woman who decides to dedicate her life to her job instead of finding a husband and having kids how does society view a women who is willing to be on call at all times she is probably a total b*tch who is going to become an old cat lady with no friends okay so she decides to get married if she works all of the time early in the relationship to try to climb the ladder so she is earning a lot of money people ask why she doesn't spend more time with her husband people ask when she is going to start having children people say things like your biological clock is ticking. not to mention if the woman earns more than the man the man is looked down on by society for not providing for his woman on the other hand if the man works long hours and then takes his woman on lavish vacations and buys her nice things people look at how wonderful of a life the couple have now let's say that the woman decides to have children having any job at all people look down on her shouldn't she be home with the children say she's a lawyer and really values her work but the man is willing to be a stay at home dad or do something with shorter more predictable hours on the side now people are flipping their lid because not only is the man not providing for his family like he should but the kids should have their mother at home with them flip roles and suddenly it is just fine the problem isn't that businesses pay 7 to woman what a man makes but that woman are pressured to sacrifice their career in a way that men aren't that's not to say that you don't have to pick and choose what your priorities are or anything if raising a family is more important than working a high paying job then by all means follow your dreams however that is something that a couple should discuss before starting a family and society should stay out of that families business if the mother wants to be a high earning business professional or a lawyer who works 0 hours/week while the father works from home as a computer programmer so that he can be with the kids great if the father wants to work the long hours and the mother wants to do something more flexible also great if they both want to work hours that are unpredictable and long well they should think of that before starting a family but both parents should be held responsible not just the mother as soon as society buzzes off that's when the wage gap will disappear.,3,NOT

"this is still where you are incorrect about any kind of earnings gap pertaining to gender) the gap doesn't exist at all to say that it is still only .6 makes anyone with this claim incorrect this is why politics suck a specific political stance will try to generalize everyone and think they are compatible within the generalization we are not like apples and oranges the comparisons are more like beets and bananas there has been a controlled scientific study that took a singular case under extreme measures to further disprove such a myth the males and females were of same age applying for the same position ethnicity and even the experience behind it the employer was told that the first  being hired could not have an increased starting pay if negotiated for it and needed females as well as males from each gender had to fit low class criteria the same rule also applied for black skinned and white skinned and so it had less discriminative power the other of each gender were going to be split the same way but of middle class this was a closed off year experiment do you know what happened within this study the men did 5 more work than the average employee all asked for more hours after - weeks this does not including job training and asked for a raise after the first year while the counterpart female was 0 less productive than the average employee females one lower class black and one middle class white took days off after years) only one of the females asked for a raise after in a half years additionally of the males were looking for another part time job while working with the one they had no wonder the gap is seen as a large problem between genders"" males just seem to work harder and they are reprimanded for it.",3,NOT

i do agree in most of the video but there's a point that wasn't mention for a guy is easier to get most of the well paid jobs than a woman also uneducated jobs are mostly male dominated like construction or gardening there's a social experiment in which a boss was sent cvs one female and one male in different professions most of the bosses including female one picked the male rather than the female as we have this patriarcal thought that male workers have more time or are more committed to their jobs also i come from colombia a country with a huge sexism in here is even illegal for women to have certain jobs.,2,NOT

cool video but i see some inaccuracies first off you say the . cents difference exists is because of choices but that . cent number comes up when you have already factored in the difference in choices on top of that the visual is misleading because it shows the difference shrinking from  cents to . cents which is not the case the difference shrinks from  $1.00-0.77 cents to . cents and then you just completely dismiss the . cents oh well we have no idea why the gap is there but just believe us when we say it doesn't exist' bad way to make a video then just say the wage gap is so much smaller then a lot of us think.,2,NOT
well to answer her question why business wouldn't just hire women if they're paid less i assume that there are a number of reasons for that the most important one is probably that a lot of male company ceos consider women to be less qualified or reliably so they're willing to hire men instead even if they cost more also the video presents the information rather misleadingly for example she says that the adjusted gender wage gap is the result of choices of the women and that she wants to look at those choices but she immediately switches back to the non-adjusted wage gap reasons that gives the impression of her explaining why the adjusted wage-gap is incorrect while she actually just explains the non-adjusted wage gap the adjusted wage-gap is still somewhere between 0 to 8% and even if it would be just 8% then the question would be still there why women should be fine with earning  less than men and why are so many guys in the comment section wanting so badly the gender wage gap not to exist what would you lose if everybody would be paid equally for the same work?,2,NOT
if i could hire a woman to do the same job at less pay i would only ever higher women,3,NOT

"i have known about the wage gap for a long time but did not realize how significant it was in class we found out that some of the highest paying jobs such as petroleum engineering are primarily help by men and jobs like education positions are held by woman and they make significant less than males i think women are expected to be in these positions because of our motherly instinct"" what was not surprising was in some positions like serves in restaurants and retail the gap was smaller to me this job works in favor of women because they are more likely to be friendly and can get tipped on how attractive they are which is actually sexist) in regards to the us men and women's soccer team wage gap the women in recent years have been more successful and have more winnings than the men but are still earning less while the gap for the top players on each team are not significantly large the further down the list the larger the gap gets between men and women pay disparity in u.s soccer it's complicated, states that women require more health insurance and there a pay cuts if they become pregnant andrew das 016) this is a parallel to what we read in the textbook businesses cut a year of wages for woman because they are likely to take a year off to take care of family members and maternity leave adams et al 013) the video there is no gender wage gap, however argues there is no gender wage gap because the studies are based off of different careers/schooling men in women have but how can they explain the gap between men and women that hold the same job and equal amount of education?",2,NOT
too bad we need someone to explain the free market.,2,NOT
i noticed that females lead jobs that help other people... just something i noticed i'm not trying to be rude about it not sure if it takes less education but psychology takes a lot of schooling so i'm not sure the common factor,2,NOT

"the women in the video have a series called the factual feminist"" it's really good",1,NOT
no mention of the biggest driver of the pay gap motherhood this is a perfect example of a variable labelled as choice that really isn't one the fact that in 017 the us still proscribes to the breadwinner model is madness and the real reason women earn less than men and it is a sexist model no biological reason why women should be the primary caregivers not supported by any empirical evidence worth reading) the lack of affordable childcare access to acceptable maternity leave or good quality part-time work means that mothers are hugely disadvantaged when it comes to work employers are even likely to discriminate against women of childbearing ages simply because they might have kids now you might think hey having kids is a choice that many women benefit emotionally from so why shouldn't they get penalised economically for a personal choice?' there's two things wrong with that firstly it isn't true for thousands of women who have unplanned pregnancies and secondly having children benefits society especially a capitalist one that needs continuous growth to survive so we should be rewarding mothers not penalising them.,1,NOT
thank god someone made this video can we finally bury this wage gap myth bs now?,3,NOT

"the title is so misleading though you concede in the video that there is actually a gender pay gap you still opted to title the video in a way that explicitly suggests that there's no wage gap what a way to deceptively push your narrative as for reasoning that no one knows for sure why there's a pay gap perhaps you should've brought up the various studies in one of which they handed out fictitious resumes with the only difference being that one was named john a boy name whilst the other was named jennifer a girl name) it found that not only was the man rated more favorably but that he was offered 4,00 more than the female candidate i don't know about you but i believe that's gender discrimination right there.",2,NOT

"i am not a feminist and this video does set some facts.. but without drawing the conclusions from them i have to say that  as a woman i observe that men are sometimes if not regularly macho towards women even in a way that they may perceive as normal or harmless i don't believe it's always purposely mean.. but therefore they do not respect women entirely while it's much more more rare that a woman would have any kind of despise towards men just for being men women usually value men as much as themselves..  if it's true that women often make choices that lead them to less well payed jobs it's partly because they are surrounded by social messages that tell them some jobs are for men and they wouldn't fit in it i'm not saying it's caused by all men nor that all women suffer from it.. but it's true for a certain prcrentage of people, and may explain the unexplained wage gap in this video which is ridiculously presented as unexplained while the answer is i'm sorry quite obvious and quite real.. once again i'm not saying that women are all oppressed by men but men make the more social oppression as they make the more sexual assaults.. take this as a remark from someone who doesn't care about gender when looking at someone but about respect and truth",2,NOT

 my highschool teach made me write a report on feminist i said i was a anti feminist because they complain about non existent problems like the wage gap and i said one of the reasons women get paid less is because they don't work as much as men the women first laughed then i show this video then they just got pissed,3,NOT
feminists don't like her woman debunks radical feminists favourite myth with this simple trick nearly died],2,NOT
feminists will never give up the  cent myth they realize that it is their greatest weapon feminists argue that women are under-represented in upper-class fields but it certainly isn't due to discrimination. 9% of all colleges have affirmative action policies that favor women and discriminate against men.,5,ABU
if only i didn't need youtube red to save this video without a virus...,1,NOT
the problem here is they don't give a shit that there's mountains of justification to why they're paid less they want equality regardless of if they deserve it or not hence why they want to tax the rich out the ass to give to poor people who haven't earned it logic doesn't matter to these people,5,ABU
i love this person we need more women like her,2,NOT
also people obsessed with the wage gap i want to make this as clear as possible going around and blaming some secret sexist cabal of men and taking it out on your co-workers and claiming that they're women-haters or w/e is stupid men and women in theory strive equally to get paid and earn raises however a store that employs 0-5 people may have only - people actually in control of the salary those two to three people may or may not be as sexist as you think they are but taking it out on your co-worker who is more interested in getting home to snuggle up to his so and spending time with the family and is doing his best to keep himself awake and in a positive mood while pouring over boring as hell spread-sheets or putting up with some idiot customer who firmly believes that 50 off applies to every item in the store instead of a specific product is only going to earn you animosity he probably doesn't set the wages he may even be mad as hell that he's putting in overtime and working extra hard but got passed over so the ceo could give himself a nice bonus he may even have a wife/sister/daughter who isn't getting paid what she should be and the entire family is suffering for it or he's doing his absolute best in his dwindling spare time to fix that accusing him of sexism is about as useful as getting mad at a chicken and accusing it of causing obesity.,2,NOT

trish when you said that you started to care about animals suffering that's the moment i knew you would succeed if you go on a vegan diet for superficial reasons just to look better trust me it is so mentally destructive you end up feeling like binging just to rebel against a very restrictive regime but if you connect with the animal suffering then eating animal products will not even cross your mind it will not feel like a diet anymore every meal will be you taking a stand against abuse and contributing to a better world it will give your life so much meaning and purpose and bring you so much happiness i promise!,1,NOT

it is not right they are not girls and are not able to be traced for doping because they can easily stop the female hormones and gain an edge that's the issue they also have male brains and they're dopamine levels are totally different from girls their fight or flight is different stature is different they aren't competing with all of the female characteristics that make women a bit slower compared to them let them compete but it needs to be a fully trans team we wouldn't have able bodied people in the para olympics because they feel disabled right.. so.. i'm just saying.. üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§öüèæ at the end of the day they are still chromosmallly boys soon to be men living as transwomen wear what you want present yourself how you want love who you want no issues with that but this is not fair at all hell we even make sure kids of certain ages can't compete against certain groups in schools we just need trans teams and then that will be fair just my opinion nototransphobia yestofairness,5,ABU

i get where youre coming from but maybe shes genderfluid and just is having a hard time figuring it out ive bounced between non binary and genderfluid i tend to stray away from non binary just because it seems to get more backlash and i dont really know why im afab sometimes i feel feminine sometimes i feel masculine get over it if we can accept trans people for just feeling the complete opposite why cant we accept people who feel both idk just dont get it i guess,1,NOT
gotta love how pathological liars get all the attention these days zoe quinn trisha paytas who's next?,3,NOT
there was a long time in my life where i thought i was a trans woman and it took years for me to come to the conclusion that i'm not trans i'm just a man who likes to feel feminine it's okay to be feminine or masculine without being transgender i don't see why everyone feels like it has to be a gender-thing for some people it is a gender-thing that's great that's what being trans is all about but sometimes it isnt and we don't always have to make it a gender thing just express yourself as you are!,1,NOT
her chest is always out in her videos she loves having big breasts and she loves being a female.,2,NOT
wait. do you eat chick fil a ironically don't they like hate the lgbt community,2,NOT

i'm not ok with my birth sex i have a phantom pene'us but i decided not to transition and to turn my lemons into lemonade because i do like men and i know transitioning would make dating triply hard and i don't want to lose friends and family and i don't want to go through puberty again i don't want to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for a million surgeries so i'm just stuck here and i've had to accept it,2,NOT
subscribed for this logical content 3,1,NOT

you know like the new guy that comes in the school and he's really hot but then he turns out to be gay yeah i just admire him from a distance but i move on i'm not like oh i'm gonna become a man so i can be with him like nobody's worth that and being barbie 4/ is not realistic we actually like to let our skin breathe and our hair rest and be comfortable you are not being a bitch if you're a woman of power you're being fucking amazing and confident and strong and powerful,2,NOT
i was born a female i grew up a tomboy i played tackle football and hockey still female i have a shaved head don't wear makeup and am tattooed still female) i dated a gay guy long story still female) i am super independent opinionated and outspoken still female) i think her video confession does more harm than good.,1,NOT
watching her face appear after yours...damn,2,NOT
okay i agreed with all of this apart from when you started talking about sam smith they have mentioned multiple times before coming out properly that they were non binary and have since and it's clear they are and their not just doing it for clout because as well that's not the type of person they are,1,NOT
the title is just like saying no you're not a female you were born with a penis‚Äù come on instead of making videos for clout help the person out trisha is confused or maybe going through something that no one can control mental illness) sick.,2,NOT

hi blaire i wanted to comment about the trisha situation i can admit honestly that up until now i did not always agree with your message mainly i didn't understand where it was coming from truly i am in a similar spot as some other younger trans people and i have to say things like this do not help it's improper representation of trans people and it's awful how trisha felt the need to capitalize as you mentioned but when this is one of the more trending videos this is what people associate us with and it is hurtful because it does indeed feel like trisha is mocking our very real struggles also i have learned so much about how to discuss these things across your videos overall! that helped me shape my own understanding i just wish at the end of the day we honestly could help eliminate these problems i'm just surprised that gigi being a trans woman herself would support trisha i know her heart is in a extremely good place but it makes me wonder if gigi actually thinks that..,2,NOT
2:2 i had the same reaction lol,1,NOT
i feel like if you take her seriously that's already a problem like literally her whole history is built off of people looking at her and going wtf and getting a laugh i'm not mad about it that's just trish lol edif:when i say you i mean everyone in general,2,NOT

is society trying to pretend that tomboys don't exist or have we simply forgotten people who say that they are non-binary or insert obscure gender here are so weird because gender presentation / physical sex and personality / gender presentation there's nothing wrong with not being masculine or feminine but it seems as though people are just trying to gain oppression points by making up genders trans people people who are actually trans and not just transtrenders are valid because they have an actual health condition their transgenderness is vindicated by science but the trans community needs to practice gatekeeping any trans person needs to have doctoral proof that they have the medical condition.,5,ABU

hey! just wanted to say how awesome you are and how much i learn about the trans community through you i had a question about something you said in this video about feeling feminine or masculine is not about gender i 0 percent agree with that statement so my question is as a trans woman what was it that made you realize that you were a female born in a man's body if it wasn't the fact that you felt more feminine than a man im sorry if this question is insensitive i definitely am ignorant to so many things that you and other trans women and men go through.,1,NOT

ummm.. yeah the majority of crushes i have st sebastian frodo antinous aka the holy trinity of hotness are at least somewhat associated with being gay especially antinous so according to trisha's logic.. i guess i should start identifying as a 4/ drag queen now in all seriousness.. god bless everyone online and irl who are willing to put up with all my classical curly-haired man-loving crazy anyways off from that tangent.. keep up the awesome work blaire white you're gorgeous funny intelligent and very entertaining to watch!,1,NOT
i don't get why she would even troll about this then again i'm not trisha and i'm not such an attention whore this does showcase the ease with which these statements are accepted in certain places which disturbs me can we please get all the poor souls coming out as trans psychological help most of the younger ones have a lot of other issues too and believe those should be treated first depression is shite anxiety is shite ptsd sounds like hell no matter how you look at it a lot of trans people need help in more ways than one i don't think trisha's behaviour helps one bit it does feel a little bit insensitive and the internet just isn't the place for these kinds of troll vids it would fit better on stage in the show of a comedian as a side note i get annoyed with the gender is a social construct thing technically gender is a social construct if you view in the way that gender is the way you express your feminity or masculinity which nobody means when they use the word gender in this context) and sex is biological however when people use it interchangeably i'm thinking they're wrong otherwise there wouldn't be a need for certain people to even feel trans nevermind actually go through the medical roller coaster in one way or another.,5,ABU

she has tried to say she is black a trump supporter religious a lesbian bisexual and now a trans man ftm all of which have been retracted or presumed retracted based on anti religious homophobic racist and transphobic comments there's only one consistent thing about trisha paytas she is an attention seeking mess and i thoroughly believe she has histrionic personality disorder.,2,NOT

god i love blaire she's such a queen,1,NOT
i believe people shouldnt be offended by trisha doing these things even though she has a big following and a priviledge of that power' i highly believe trisha makes these videos as a therapy out loud thinking she just says what she feels and she doesnt know or care about the consequences because thats for later to face she loves the attention and doesnt know how to balance her issues,1,NOT
i really hope one day everyone can fully understand what transgender really means and can accept it and treat everyone equal.,1,NOT

i fucking hate ur title you can't tell her what she is it's confusing and there's little backstory and little reason but you don't know her and you don't know how her mind works or how she feels or even how she really acts it's discrediting to think that she's being kinda cancelled for opening up wether it's believable or not people identify as fucking anything they want leave her be,3,NOT
oh also did y'all see the interview she had she said she's not doing any of the transitioning like no surgeries t anything she said she's gonna keep dressing and looking the same as she usually does welp there's that looks like you don't have to do the crow mukbang anymore xd,2,NOT
i think her ex and his friends made her so ashamed of being a woman and made her so ashamed of who she is that she has become so confused about who she is without them i think she genuinely thinks she's in the right mentally but she is not getting good guidance and she needs therapy i don't think she knows you have to have dysphoria to be trans maybe she's gender fluid maybe she's just ashamed of who she is either way her friends really need to help her right now.,1,NOT

maybe all transsexual woman should stop using transgender to define themself becaus our true specificity is transsexual few years ago i had big fight about those transsexual who wanted to exclude the ones who choose to keep there genitals and named them as transgender but this is not reality being transsexuals is about hormones and not surgery someone who remove the penis does not make this person a transsexual a man whitout a penis still is a man but named eunuch so to remove a sex genitals does not make a transsexual this is the fact and the truth it is only by the hormones that we become a woman and change our body from inside it is the hormones that grow breast and modify our shape so all of those who are on a therapy of hormones to change there gender become transsexuals there is no shame to use this word it doesn't make you a sexworking person using this definition if this is why you choose not to use the real definition transgender is a generic noun to put everything in it even the alien anybody who play with there look by fantasy or anybody who is delusionals about things related to the human state transsexual is a specific noun and only people on hormones can be name like that it exclude all the others and by the way things are going it is better transgender noun is harmfull for us by the way non-binary and else has use this to put discord in the society by doing so they destroy all the sensibility build by the pioneer from the last  years or more this is what we can observe i am a transsexual woman when some people come to me and ask if i am a transgender i correct that for transsexual becaus this is what i am really and i do not want to be associated to all the crazy people clamed to be transgender them and me are not in the same side we must stop that non-sens.,2,NOT

you literally said everything i thought i love you sm,1,NOT

"false alarm shes now questioning""",2,NOT
okay but like i do not agree with trisha i don't think she is trans but when you brought sam smith and the person from queer eye into it saying they wanted to come out for clout i do not agree with that yes they might not talk about it maybe because they don't just want the attention if they just did it for clout don't you think they will make it a bigger thing than it already is yes the person from queer eye might have not came out in 012 but that's because not a lot of people were okay with lgbt and gender identity and things like that back then it's 019 it is the best time to be coming out because you do have so many people supporting it and a lot more acceptance and a lot more rights not saying there aren't people out there who hate but i'm just saying its more accepted now then it was a few years ago but with the whole trisha being trans thing yes she is obviously doing it for the clout and views no arguments on that one.,2,NOT
trisha is an attention whore plain and simple she's not the only one who makes videos and post like this but she does this type of crap for the clicks and attention.,5,ABU
she is the stupidest most offensive and ignorant ugly ass bitch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5,ABU
the real question is.. what in the hell did trisha do to her lips did she stick them in a suction pump or something?,2,NOT
ok but when you ask trans people how they knew they were trans they always talk about how they identified with superficial stuff of the opposite gender so what are we supposed to think üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄ you can't really have a female experience without being a female but that's a whole other can of worms,2,NOT

us is trisha trans trisha well yes but actually no,2,NOT
personally the video doesn't impact me i know who i am the main issue that i feel a lot of us have especially transguys like myself is that this video will open up a whole bunch of more issues the video could promote more people assuming that they are perfectly okay with being their biological sex feeling that they are trans because they feel masculine at times and unfortunately this could lead people to transitioning then regretting it all of that aside i'm sorry if my english is awful blaire you are just amazing and i love your videos drinking vodka should be you're introüòÇ‚ù§,1,NOT

trish paytas is a prime example of how a weak-minded moron can be convinced of extremely high end bullshit easily in the future this sort of shit is going to be considered an alternate form of munchausen's syndrome the only barrier to it now is that these stunning and brave gag! morons...uhhh individuals are getting mainstream acceptance and the thing about that is it really isn't helping them any in fact it's doing the opposite if someone wants to know how this works it is entirely possible for a parent to hate their child and at the same time smother them with appears to be love at the same time how does it happen shelter them from life don't let them grow up when a parent loves their child as if that child is their possession like an inanimate object that's going through the motions of love and doing bad things to their child in order to keep that child how they want that child to be to an unhealthy extreme or... your child is unhappy and they tell you they just don't want to live anymore and you hand them the gun because it's what they want after all i would argue that a hovering parent or a helicopter parent can actually be worse than a lackadaisical parent neither parent is giving their children direction in a proper fashion on one hand you have children who have no supervision no leadership and and direction leading that kid to seek other people for direction more often than not we're talking the wrong kinds of influences here... and to tell the truth most of them are the exact same way... no parents being a parent on some level they know what they are doing is wrong or bad for them but that doesn't stop them from becoming psychopaths sociopaths drug addicts thieves gang members or any number of other types of criminals out there with a hovering parent the child is clearly in control and it's the parents job to make sure nothing bad happens.while this may generate fewer bad seeds in number these little fuckers are far worse than the other side because these little shits have their parents to cover their six when they start fucking up they have a mandate to be assholes and never have to deal with the consequences because the parents keep those little fuckers from ever experiencing consequences so their bad behavior starkly overshadows all but the worst of the children raised in lackadaisical environments.,5,ABU

wage gap discussion tend to gravitate around these facts but shouldn't the real discussion be around what drives us toward these choices in life if we're being taught into specific roles values and norms from the very young age these will surely have an effect on our career choices young girls who have technical parents role models will more likely statistics aim for technical field girls who don't have these role models are more likely to go into the fields society media culture etc. advertises for them what stops women from applying stem degrees/careers? isn't really an effective question now is it the same logic applies for boys and men too of course edit the points in this video are facts yes.,1,NOT

sjw and feminist starts screeching horrifically,2,NOT
my wife is a doctor and i'm a technician.. she gets paid double what i make.. uhh... so sexist!!!,2,NOT
this is explained by the fact that all the higher paying jobs demand more time working when women are still expected to take care for children it is because the hour aren't flexible enough that there is a gender pay gap corporates don't choose women even if they work at lower wages because they are not viewed as workers but rather as women who have to be available to their children at home tasks are still managed almost entierely by women even when both parents have full time jobs the gender pay gap therefore exists you should be ashamed to post such ignorant content.,2,NOT
women need to be positive this gap decreases.,2,NOT
one variable that i don't see discussed very often is negotiation i started a new job recently and whilst going through the application process the company made an offer i thought i was worth more than that offer so dug my heels in and negotiated i ultimately settled on a wage that was 6 above the initial offer it's quite possible for two people with identical qualifications doing a the same job and even recruited at the same time to be getting paid differently just because one was prepared to take a risk and negotiate whereas the other just took the initial offer put on the table studies have shown that men are on average more likely to negotiate when an offer is put on the table.....probably because men are bigger risk takers and this could certainly explain some of the residual wage gap after things like qualifications experience etc are factored in again negotiating or not is a choice people make if you chose not to negotiate can you really feel aggrieved because you end up getting paid less than somebody who did.,1,NOT

want a real gender wage gap? i was working in a factory setting where the ratio to men:women was :1 the women were constantly handed easier tasks and complained about their tasks labor intensity often the men would be told to step in to fulfill the labor aspect for the women what really upsets me is that i along with other men working there are doing .5x a persons work while the women avoided a portion of their task and still gets paid as much or in lots of cases more traditionalism and equality don't mix well.,2,NOT
if the gender gap really is a myth then that's great news it means we're on the right track for equality but i'm noticing a distinct lack of sources in the description and it seems to only talk about america i would be far more convinced if i could check for myself where the video gets these statistics from and whether they apply outside the us.,1,NOT

in the video the myth of the gender wage gap it explains how even though might be a wage gap for women to men it is not large as most individuals believe it is the first time watching the video i was convinced that the wage gap may not be a big deal although going back to what we have learned in class especially in the lecture from monday we learned how the wage gap is very noticeable christina hoff mentions good topics to prove her point the one that struck out to me was if women get paid less why don't business just hire women they are less cheaper hoff has a strong stance when she explains how feminist individuals are not implementing important factors such as hours worked positions and education when they are calculating the wage gap this convinced me that the wage gap might not be as dramatic as people think it is after all these factors are implicated in the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real? it shows how adjusted measurements will be made to increase the possibility to use statistics for the wage gap women have a lot of responsibility and some even say more than man for the majority of women they are the ones in charge of picking up their children and taking care of their necessities like appointments and activities such as sports therefore all this responsibility has made women take fewer hours in their jobs or not work at all it is hard to conclude a solid stance because of what both side of the wage gap leave from the leader presentation we learned how clearly women do not make the same as men although from the video once other factors are entered it changes things so when will we receive the actual unbiased information in american household men make more money than women therefore most women work part time jobs or do not work at all if men and women are working the exact same job hours education capability and there is still a wage gap then more things should be done to stop it but only until the statistics are true in this country i believe that women still have a lot more freedom to make their own choices than in other countries.,1,NOT
i can see it now colleges are sexist because the highest paying courses aren't catering to females! oh god you can practically taste the anger.,2,NOT
men earn more and can work longer hours at higher paying jobs because women are traditionally tasked with taking care of children maybe that's where we need to work on equality in the home.,1,NOT

ok so as someone who did used to think the wage gap was more of a big deal i'm glad for this clarification but the wage gap isn't the only inequality between genders in the workplace is there anyone that knows of a paper that compares the salaries of women and men who work the same job i was disappointed that this video didn't cover that difference since that is probably where the -ish wage gap that does exist comes from legitimate question btw i'm not looking to pick a fight.),1,NOT
women also leave to have children which makes them riskier employees when in positions of power since you know eventually you will have to find a replacement to fill the position and also sets them back for several months per child or longer if they elect to stay home with it for longer.,2,NOT

it's nice that this video marshals research for evidence but unfortunately it's very selective and biased most glaringly the argument ignores decades of research which has looked into the role of gender and negotiation in perpetuating the wage-gap on average for example women are less likely to initiate negotiations for their salaries less likely to counter-offer and more likely to make greater concessions and while this is a choice it does not follow as the video tries to claim that preference and sexism are incompatible on the contrary what the research shows is that when women negotiate assertively on their own behalf they are perceived as acting in a stereotypically incongruent manner i.e not relationship oriented and are therefore viewed negatively by their counterpart in other words women have to face a trade-off between power and likeability that men do not have to deal with which is kinda of like the definition of sexism) as a result in a conscious and strategic effort to avoid social backlash to dodge being perceived as pushy or nasty women tend to either avoid negotiations all together or be less competitive hence they get less over the course of a career these numbers really add up fascinatingly the negotiation gender-gap all but disappears when women are asked to negotiate on behalf of others they are more comfortable being aggressive and are less likely to be judged harshly for doing so as women who negotiate on behalf of others are not violating a stereotype) yet this representation approach tends to put a lot of people in a difficult bind perpetuate a stereotype or wait till the system is transformed.,1,NOT

i once debated this with my wife she afirmately said that the gap was from the same job in the same company then i explained her that it is a general data and asked her two things  are you willing to find a job that pays 3 less but have a well diversificate work hours so you can take care of our son  do you think that the avarage women would choose to sacrifice her wage for the family i didn't heard the answer but she moved on to another subject how the society dictates the role of the women....,2,NOT

there is a factor you missed the reduction of women's salary after the maternity leave but i don't blame you at all since the united states is one of the very few countries where women don't need to receive by law a period without working when they have a son i thought i had to explain it to you,1,NOT

i believe you may have misunderstood the argument the argument is not that there is a literal gap in which at the same job post women are paid less than men it is that systematically women are prevented or discouraged from obtaining higher paid work for a number of different reasons men are seen as more powerful wise and omniscient women are more likely to be the primary care-giver to their children women are more often than not disrespected in positions of authority because of man's insecurity etc.,1,NOT
the argument that feminists are making is that they want equal pay so that means that in their eyes a female social worker should earn the same as a male eco consultant reminds me of something.....communism.,2,NOT

i like that they picked a woman to do it so the liberals can't go straight to calling this sexist,2,NOT

remaining oblivious to facts and reason regarding the wage gap propaganda in the us is far too lucrative for the neofeminist movement to abandon without the ghost of patriarchy to chase there are few gendered causes to rally around and individuals within the movement are left only with introspection which almost never yields the results anticipated our society does indeed have issues that require addressing but as long as neofeminists continue to taint each with the attitude that men are the sole cause for these problems many people from both genders will be reticent to become allies for these causes neofeminism having equal opportunity yet demanding equality of outcome.,2,NOT

one of the variables for the . cents left is maternal verse paternal leave in australia employers are at least legally binned to offer - weeks paternal leave verse something like - weeks i think i'm not 00 sure for maternal leave so even if both people take their maximum allotted leave and come back with their spouse taking care of the child the man will still work more hours the pay given is still equal but less than they would earn than when they're working therefore there is at least part of that . cents probably a large part due to it being not even mentioned in this video,1,NOT

as a left-leaning individual i can say that this is a very well-done video this kind of content is exactly why i subscribe to prageru and would love to see more of because it uses facts and research as opposed to anecdotes to challenge a particular view it could only be made better if they were to cite every claim they make and link in the description so we can follow up on them there are certainly other videos by prageru that do make me suspicious of the source and i feel a better argument could be made if those were cited left-leaning because i'd rather not identify by party because neither side is 00 correct on everything and to place that label on yourself is to put yourself into a box where you feel pressure to defend your ideology's world view as opposed to your personal world view.,1,NOT

the argument that educated activists are making about the inequality in overall pay is that women gravitating towards lower paying majors is the issue systematic sexism is the problem i personally have never claimed that individual businesses are paying women less though that may be true for some) it is the expectations of women in society that are the real problem we need to advocate for encouraging young women and showing them that they are capable of pursuing careers in male dominated fields the expectation that women must be the primary carers for children which in itself is no issue but the expectation is!! is another problem that forces women from getting demanding jobs this video's points did not address this problem at all and instead made the points supporting the inequality argument much clearer systematic sexism is the problem not an abundance of individual sexism in each employer focus on the real issues please not responding to a tangential point.,1,NOT

listen mate while the wage gap might not be .7 cents to the dollar which is actually the stats for white women only women of color earn even less) it is still real there have been countless studies by universities such as harvard and oxford that show that for almost identical jobs for people in similar situations women are paid significantly less businesses don't hire all women because studies show that business owners tend to prefer male workers even if the woman is just as qualified or even better if you guys want to believe this it's because you've believed it all along and like hearing your opinion voiced with facts which in itself is fine because everyone does but the thing is that facts are not things to be believed they are things to be understood this woman obviously has done well enough or is ignorant enough to not have experienced the need for feminism but that doesnt mean we disregard facts her presentation is obviously meant to be persuasive not informative which of course effects how the whole thing should be viewed im not trying to start anything and if you want to stick to your opinions fine but don't spew this out as fact because it has statistical evidence because that hurts the livelihoods of most working women.,1,NOT

really great video quick thought i feel like to voice a right wing opinion to the left we must use a member of a minority to make the statements lest they write the opinions off by calling said speaker a racist or sexist for instance to speak out against feminism it must be a woman or the points will be written of on the basis that the person speaking is a sexist also for a right wing opinion on race to be discussed it must be a non-white person doing the discussion to avoid the points being ignored because the person making them is perceived as a racist just an observation.,1,NOT

the ratio of women to men in my mechanical engineering class was :30 don't get me wrong that one girl could put most of us to shame she was a very hard worker but that ratio is still insane with that said it was the opposite ratio for people taking nursing it's just the way it is people have free choice they choose.,1,NOT

what about the women who work the same amount of time at the same job providing the same services as their fellow male colleagues and still get paid less i don't understand how that would be based on choice or effort it's also not 'myth' or 'fake news'' correct me if i'm wrong but the market is still sexist.,1,NOT

people on the left pushing the wage gap are trying to make the point that if a man and a woman are working the same job that due to sexism companies and corporations will pay the women 3 less than men correct i have points a: who are the companies doing this where are the whistleblowers how could any company get away with a policy like this in 01 and keep everyone silent men and women b: for every job you found where men and women were making the same money in the same position for hours worked etc. you would have to find another where the woman was making 6 less than the man in the same position for hours worked to get 7 right?,1,NOT

how do i marry this woman?,1,NOT
yes everything you said is completely true they high paying jobs are dominated by males and that is the point ask yourself why isn't that men are more like to choose to become an engineer then a women and as a women in engineering i will tell you that it is because from day one women face more challenges in the technical world then men do society systematically guides men to the fields of high paying jobs and women to the low paying jobs girls grow up being told to play with dolls and makeup while guys get building blocks and kinects i know there is way more to this then that basic example but you get the idea this systematic sexism is what the cents on a  movement is about.,1,NOT

this is a great video good arguments however you didn't take into account other places in the world in easter europe where i live this wage gap is real there is still a lot of people in management places who hire women instead of men for this exact reason they give them less in fact they are going to do the same job but man wouldn't accept this instead a more defenseless woman can be taken advantage of! i am willing to believe that in the us and westerneurope it's negligible but in the eastern europe and other underdeveloped countries its a real problem.,1,NOT
"84,00 and ,00  do that math feminism.",2,NOT

there should be a gender pay gap women suck as workers if there weren't laws against gender discrimination i think a lot of employers wouldn't hire them men do all the hard work while the women socialize with their obnoxious coworker friends and barely break a sweat anyone who has worked a job that requires manual labor has observed this they get paid for doing barely anything they are the laziest workers a man could do their hours of work in one hour paying a woman who barely does shit the same as a man who does all the work is not reasonable.,3,NOT

is this god,1,NOT
the wages are always payed per hour so this whole women work less has no significance in this debate the point is you should pay women and men equal amounts per hour for performing on the same tasks with same responsabilities it's that simple so many of these arguments are complete nonsense extreme feminism is very damaging i agree but so is this wisely covered up antifeminism.,1,NOT
the people who push the wage gap are also the same people who say they are democratic socialists who are in essence communists,2,NOT
think this vid misses a huge aspect of the gender pay gap little girls are taught to dress in pink and love unicorns and princesses....then they grow up and are expected to have babies stem subjects aren't sexy no wonder they don't choose them the issue with the pay gap is not just a of money difference it's a cultural difference and stems from how we raise our girls versus boys.,1,NOT
try working at the same place for  years and having a man make the same amount as you day  same education same position and same company this is the story of my mother she worked in the same factory since she was 8 it's because of unions you know organizations that are supposed to protect workers just not the ones that actually work.,1,NOT

i found out about the gender wage gap when i heard bernie sanders harping about how awful the situation had become for women i went to his website to read up on the topic i found only bullet points so i was forced to do my own research to see how such an injustice had continued to occur it took me about  minutes to find out that bernie sanders was a socialist windbag who cared more about votes than doing what was right any politician any politician who tries to use this bs wage gap number to push their agenda should be bound gagged and flogged we're talking about national policy and the highest political offices in our country there is no place for this kind of bs when something so important is at stake.,2,NOT

brilliant absolutely brilliant thank you christina for everything you do.,1,NOT
you know i would hazard a guess that the reason women take lower paying jobs and work shorter less consistent hours is because of the social pressure and gender roles that dictate that they should females are encouraged to take lower paying professions because those professions are often more traditionally feminine typically female dominated areas will probably seem safer for women to take and typically male dominated areas will seem safer for men to take women may work fewer hours because they are expected to care for any children children they are expected to have.,1,NOT
i'm so happy to see another woman talking about this i don't know any body else who has the same opinion as me great work ),1,NOT
so maybe the question is why are those majors predominantly male or female i'm not debating that the facts are wrong but how does this pattern come about that males have the highest paying majors on lock down and females have the lowest(granted by choice but why did they choose that?,1,NOT

lots of these facts are actually outdated the top best paying job statistics was from years ago whilst the worst was years ago during this year gap colleges have progressively invited more female students into colleges and some of the best fulfilling colleges don't accept women as often even today also you account women's maternity leave yet not a man's so that the gap seems closer i think both the extremist feminists and conservatives are both fabricating statistics the gap is more like  cents and there needs to be something done about it in an equality based manner.,1,NOT
came here to see flame wars in the comments,1,NOT
i tried to bring these points up apparently statistics and logic are sexist.,1,NOT

its funny to think about that when people aren't killing each other in war they occupy their minds with this sort of thing like the wage gap isn't that big of a deal at all i'll explain why i said that later) the only reason this is going on is that in the modern world we lack the stimuli from tragedic events we as a species are used to so we have to come up with our own and i'm not saying that women aren't discriminated at all but so many people misses to understand the fact that things have never been better its naive to say that the patriarchy is behind all of this when in fact in the last decades we have been moving so much forward in this field it isn't as simple as to just move forward from the way of thinking that men are superior because in the past that was true due to physical attributes that were necessary i.e hunting and warfare the way of life we have now is so small portion of the human history that its almost idiotic to say that women have it bad so my point is that it is important to drive equality forward but please understand that it isn't an overnight thing but hey what do i know i'm a straight white male from a country that was one of the first to give women right to vote and has already had a female president.,1,NOT

very good arguments but when i first heard this myth i did my own research and found that there is a different sized wage gap for every single job out there and that something like 9 of those is where women are the bigger earners so i think my arguments deviate somewhat from sommers's arguments but they still argue against the same lie.,1,NOT

one huge thing that the video missed was that women take off time from work when they have children in some cases women take off as much as or years from their career studies show women end up going back into different career fields or different companies and basically starting all over after having a child what must that do to their professional development and potential to earn any feminist who demands a woman get paid the same as a man after she is taking years off of professional development and work is being extremely sexist themselves if you work harder and longer you deserve more!,2,NOT

well it is true women get paid the same but why is the unemployment line in my area 00 male and why is it that businesses are refusing to hire a male who meets the qualifications that the employer is asking for and instead hiring a female right out of high school who does not meet the requirements also why is it that the average female here has as many as jobs when the male can not even find one no matter how hard they look the answer because business are being required to hire a female over a male and oh yea lets not forget the homelessness ratio which happens to be yea you guessed it 00 male why because they can not get jobs.,2,NOT

the greatest thing about this is that a woman is speaking and has sources from a feminist organization the key piece missing here is that the smaller percentage of women being hired in stem fields science technology engineering and math are actually paid more than men due to corporate demographic quotas so though women may be under represented in those fields by choice it is actually discriminatory towards men in the aspect of payroll savethemales,2,NOT
as a conservative this is the best feel good video for meüòôüëç,1,NOT
so the point of the video is saying that there is no wage gap by explaining why there is a wage gap?,1,NOT
uber did a study on this too they found the exact same percentage gap existed but not because women were paid less if anything uber is renowned for its equality-focused business model instead women were more willing to work more flexible hours stayed in the uber system for less time and weren't as competitive as men with regard to where the best spots were the wage gap existed primarily due to experience behind the wheel in the uber system where men spent longer hours and were more driven pun intended to earn the most out of their position they deduced women had more obligations such as family than men and are more open to reviewing their choices by transferring from one job to the next men on the other hand are willing to find the most profitable position and stick with it regardless of how it goes it reveals the key psychological differences between men and women seem to reflect their earnings.,1,NOT

"how is this so hard for the public to realize there is no wage gap nobody in there right mind would pay others less or more based on their gender the only gap would be based on there physical and or mental capabilities but there is no gap in reality it is a factor on a few different things that cause the wage gap"" it is the fact that women end up not choosing fields that earn them as much for an obvious example there are many more male doctors than female and on the other side there are many more female nurses than male nurses they both are in the same field but there is a clear difference on what they end up choosing also if you ask a lot of girls on what they want to be ones that choose medical fields end up saying i want to be a nurse much more than i want to be a doctor"" that is the equivalent of somebody saying that they want to be a co-pilot maybe that comparison was different but there is an obvious correlation in all fields with this just like you will see a lot more hostess at restaurant than hosts female hostess) another besides that is the effort it would take for females to do certain tasks such as heavy lifting ones or dirty ones clearly men go into that field because they are genetically by far better and they would need or more women to complete a task than man for most cases i can go on with a lot of details but the last would be things like maternity leave causing them to literally miss work for months because they had a child which is understandable but if you want that to be on your options you need to take less pay or you just don't get paid leave.",2,NOT

things not addressed that would be helpful for further research are there simply fewer women in the highest paying fields or do these fields pay more because they are male dominated in cases of change where more men go into traditionally-female fields such as teaching and nursing does this drive up wages across the board or just for male employees do both genders really have the same access to all professional fields or do recruiting hiring and training processes seem to favor one gender over another in certain fields ie is it a matter of simple choice or are our choices curated before they get to us how have increasing trends in women working in higher skilled educated fields impacted wages overall ie is there any evidence that wages go down in a field when more women enter it what differences in socialization based on gender impact things like negotiating wage applying for jobs which you don't necessarily have all the qualifications for etc.,1,NOT
the title of the video does not fit the conclusion of the video which argues that there is a gender wage gap but it is smaller than the 7c in the dollar commonly reported.,1,NOT
"well theres ,00 feminist that disliked this video",2,NOT
finally something i can agree to with pragru,1,NOT
omg your a gurl and you defending the horrific mysogonistic excuse my spelling privileged males you disgust me,3,NOT
the best part is this is talked about by a women,1,NOT
just to quote the source where did she get the precentages for the jobs?,1,NOT
and lefties still claim there's a wage gap,2,NOT
finnaly a women that is not a feminist,2,NOT
the swedish goverment is also spreading this lie,2,NOT
the gender wage gap by definition simply looks only at the average median earnings of both sexes therefore this video subconsciously agrees that it exists it simply misunderstood the definition as men getting paid more for equal work which rarely happens in developed countries),1,NOT
gender wage gap is they basically woman more money for doing less.,2,NOT
if most woman do work which is supposed to be less paying and the gap is only . cents and there are way less full day working woman than men woman are actually earning way more than men ever can men to fight for fair pay!,2,NOT
i bet the patriarchy made those women choose a lower paying job.,1,NOT
our lord and savior,1,NOT
im only on here because im in school and we have a sub,1,NOT
this is the best add i have ever seen on youtube,1,NOT
so when you account for different choices men and women make it becomes . cents so what about those . cents what's the explanation for that?,1,NOT
why are women so butthurt men are expected to pay for everything anywaysü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,2,NOT
there is a gap there is inequality but the cause is not what anybody thinks the cause is central banks like the fed the sad thing is most people don't have any clue what a central bank is anymore or more important how it really works.,1,NOT
thank christ the person in this vid was a a women or else feminists would just say he's lying lol,2,NOT
from my understanding of this video its the fact that women are expected to have worst paying jobs and are expected to be home more,1,NOT
how does this video not have million disslikes lmao this is genius,1,NOT
thank you for this.,1,NOT
even though i do lean left it's pretty obvious the wag gap is b.s then again.. feminism as a whole is b.s.,2,NOT
thomas sowell said it already since the 0's...,1,NOT
i love how they got a women to do this its so much more convincing take that feminists,2,NOT
because gender studies is the rightful path to gain a lot of income.,2,NOT
hahahaha is this video serious?,1,NOT
prager university had a woman narrate this and probably quite a few write/produce it as well and there's still  thousand uninformed sjws that downvoted this video because of the title.,2,NOT
someone should run a business but they hire all men for yrs then hire all woman for yrs just to prove a point,2,NOT
there is still a problem women still staying at home taking care of the kids because the majority of men refuse to that makes quite a portion of women in marriage leave their jobs and not make any money it affects statistics it doesn't mean that women are paid less just like you said but it is still sexism another problem may be the way we are socialized a study shows that women in general have way less self-esteem than men this influences career chooses while men tend to go for a harder degree women with the same grades go for a easier one that happens because men usually overrate their capabilities while women do the opposite that kind of justifies the fact that there are so many men studying engeneering and so many women at magistrate degrees another fact is that wherever there is a space with a high proportion of male presence that space is masculinified and it pushes away many women from taking a step an being part of it at last but not least there are some studies which show that women tend to choose careers in relation to caring of others like pedagogy related degrees or healthcare) and those of course are not tastes we are born with there are a whole lot of psychology studies that show us the evidence about that i say that as a psychologist) well i think i left a lot of room for yall to think some of these thoughts of mine are only hypothesis but im pretty sure that they will turn out to be true if somebody makes a research.,1,NOT
i wish this mentioned the fact that women also disproportionately care for children an average of almost 0 of their careers since it's easy to see how women would make almost  cents on the dollar less.,1,NOT
woww!! i never knew this!!.. i was a bigger believer in the gender wage gap  but prageru has opened up mind eyesüò®.. god bless prageruü§ò,1,NOT
debunk the race pay gap,2,NOT
i find it interesting that the career paths presented as being dominated by females are industries predominately in the oversight and regulation of government not saying that the government doesn't have its hands in all of the mentioned industries just observing that the most government interaction is obvious in the female dominated industries.,1,NOT
her voice is so soft and sweet Ô∏è,1,NOT
so do we not still see an issue with the fact that every discrepancy is chalked up to choice it's not that hard to imagine that there are social pressures at play for men to occupy certain jobs and women to occupy certain jobs.,1,NOT
"to be honest it depends.. some firms are in fact being sexist and paying men more than women but in the general 7 cents idea that some people have what she says in the video is largely true.. although i don't think gender matters in who's willing to work more"" because i believe in equal opportunities since gender equality cannot and shouldn't be achieved).. i think men and women are human and they both can do the same things depends on how much work they put into it...",1,NOT
excellent finally the truth!,1,NOT
thank you this has always been my thinking.,1,NOT
i agree with this all the way but how come u.s women's soccer gets watched more than u.s men's soccer but gets paid less...,1,NOT
wage gap intensifies,2,NOT
thanks for sharing your research.,1,NOT
if a woman got  cents to a man's  then why don't buisnesses hire only women it would be 7 cheaper in terms of wage excuse me i have to go educate some people.,2,NOT
it's being said by a woman therefore it must be true,1,NOT
wait your argument is that there can't be a pay gap because if there were companies would only hire women?? lol.,1,NOT
this video makes a lot of sense to me however how do you respond to a feminist's counter that women are conditioned and socially gendered i.e oppressed to choose the less high-paying careers e.g girls growing up play house growing up taking care of dolls and etc - nurturing jobs or motherhood in other words a feminist would say that women do not have free choice because of society's conditioning how do you disprove that?,1,NOT
i feel like an important choice this video skirts around is the choice to be a mother we as a country don't have laws protecting maternity rights also clarification i am not a feminist i find the idea degrading and counterintuitive i am however a deontologist who values all people:),1,NOT
"feminists sees video comments well obviously she is just a fake women and is a man in disguise""",2,NOT
yes there is,1,NOT
another thing that you notice about feminists is that they often have this toxicity and hostility in debates as soon as you disagree with something they say and counter it with facts you're just an offended and insecure and most importantly mansplaining broflake or something like that basically all the time when a dude disagrees with something a feminist says he is instantly met with ad hominem attacks or other forms of highly arrogant and almost narcissistic answers i can't recall a feminist that actually started to engage in a discussion in which he/she actually replied to my comments it basically always follows this scheme . initial comment based on perceived truths . countering that statement with actual facts . ad hominem attacks and bringing up more unproven claims while ignoring the facts from the first answer . countering the new claims with facts as well . fleeing into conspiracy like excuses example well the patriarchy raises us like that!!!! when you showcase how the pay gap is a result from individual choices and further ignoring the stated facts or simply claiming they are wrong without providing facts and evidence to support the claim that the aforementioned facts are really wrong,3,NOT
2:0 simple enough men chose a job that pays better so all the sudden women get discriminized because they made a bad choice,2,NOT
could you believe my mom makes less money than justin bieber absolutely disgusting sexism,2,NOT
no no!! don't tell the truth it does not fit into the rhetoric and the agenda of neo-feminists don't do it.,2,NOT
ok so it is a pay gap not a wage gap this is still a problem.,1,NOT
i'm showing feminists this video.,2,NOT
i love you based mom.,1,NOT
5.1k dislikes from people who can't handle the truth,2,NOT
i learn this from maddox years ago but glad to see it getting out there.,1,NOT
i'd like to think all this is true can someone please give me some sources for the facts here because prageru have a fairly horrendous reputation for simply appealing to their audience over giving the complete accurate story case and point their video on carbon dioxide which was painfully inaccurate),1,NOT
thank you lol,1,NOT
the right wing bias and lies on this channel man hahahah,2,NOT
they used to pay married men more than single men. and paid women less than that since they thought women would marry and raise a family and leave company,1,NOT
great video keep it up!,1,NOT
wow much respect for your decision to make this an advertisement on youtube takes some guts to spread the message and open yourself to feminist hate take my like if it means anything.,2,NOT
i got an ad for you on the video,1,NOT
what's surprising is that you guys never made a video on this before.,1,NOT
to be fair there are misogynist people in some positions of power who tend to not promote women as readily not employ them or discriminate against them in other ways it really does happen and it's not a thing that should happen and this could explain parts of a wage gap however most people aren't like that and you don't tackle an issue effectively by exaggerating it to the point of absurdity and thus ruining your credibility in the public eye like most feminists these days do).,2,NOT
middle class white woman are one of the most privileged groups in human history be grateful that you're not expected to do work,2,NOT
i'm pretty sure that if a women picks a dollar up off the ground that it's actually only worth  cents while if it were a man it would be a whole dollar as such i found myself in a particular issue when my year set of twins  male female brought up the wage gap difference to fix this i found that the average  tooth fairy gift per tooth would be balanced by my daughter being provided more coins to equal the values they are both super happy that i had talked to the tooth fairy for them the tooth fairy tends to leave a little extra though providing the 2.7 for my daughter while this is a little more than the proper balance of money from the wage gap which my son isn't too okay with i see no problems with it when they get older and i have to pay them to clean their rooms i'll probably end up doing the same thing as the tooth fairy that way everything is fair.,2,NOT
"can this be required viewing for every dopey idiot that went on strike yesterday and attended the women's march""?",2,NOT
also i'm pregnant so i don't want to work a lot so i'm mad because i'm not making as much as my male coworkers because they are still working  hours instead of my sad  hours i need the same pay amount as they do even though i work less..... that's what you dumb ass women sound like _ use your brains not your gender to be logical,3,NOT
may i have the sources pls i need to do more research on this.,1,NOT
god i love this video,1,NOT
the . dislikes are all women xd no offense to anyone it's just a joke),2,NOT
there is solid evidence wage gaps between men and women exist i wrote a thesis for school on it.,1,NOT
is this for america or the world?,1,NOT
there is no war in ba sing se.,1,NOT
i¬¥d like to take this one step further and question why female dominated college majors don¬¥t pay off i mean we¬¥re talking early childhood education psychology community organization and social work these things are unarguably important and no less essential to a functioning society than petroleum engineering so why does so little money flow there making the jobs even more unattractive than they already are the way different working fields are rewarded directly reflects on what values a society holds and while economic interests may be a justification it¬¥s surely not an ethical one sorry for any grammar errors not a native speaker),1,NOT
women deserve nothing,5,ABU
isn't it interesting when you point out that a a social ill is not actually a problem the response is yes it is! instead of oh great i'm so glad that's not really happening. it's almost as if some people want things to be going poorly...,2,NOT
i am ashamed of cousins and certain aunts and uncles who think that there is gender discrimination in payment really ashamed they unfortunately follow the herd mentality.,2,NOT
wow prager did a video that has sound research am i in an alternative universe?,1,NOT
next thing you know feminists will start saying that women aren't being let into higher paying jobs as much,2,NOT
but but.. muh wage gap!,2,NOT
ooooooohhhh some marxist tushies getting chapped here!,2,NOT
while this is all true it doesn't question why jobs that are primarily male occupied are paid more than jobs that are female occupied why are teachers paid less than say advertisers because this is capitalism and your value is determined by your contribution to the flow of money out of consumers pockets into the hands of the top %) if you can make money for the biggest companies that are all controlled by just a few hundred people either by creating a product marketing that product through the media or by being an influential actor or athlete or by altering the publics view of your company in a positive way then you will be rewarded with a big paycheck many govt jobs are male dominated as well but why don't women gravitate to these higher paying jobs as often as men because of gender roles instilled in us since birth men are told at an early age to be tough not show emotion be confident and that their worth is determined by their personal drive to succeed and be the breadwinner woman are told either directly or indirectly through the media to be nurturing respectful not be too loud or else be called bossy or a bitch and that their appearance is what matters some of these things are less extreme than in past years and more women are entering stem fields but turn on a tv and its clear they are still common tropes society shapes who we become and the choices we make and it's clear that white men are in the highest positions of power in this country and decide what we see and hear in our daily lives why would they not push messages that keep them in power just look at trump and his rich white male cabinet another thing to consider is that when women do end up in male dominated fields such as the oil business they are often harrassed and considered inadequate for the job this video also ignores the study that found when two identical resumes are submitted to employers with the names john smith or jane smith john gets hired more often this video is too simple for such a complex problem.,1,NOT
i totally 00 agree however i would like to see some sources,1,NOT
this is definitely a group of trump supporters...,1,NOT

go ahead and shit on me but early childhood education shouldn't require a degree to me please prove me wrong did you not learn everything you needed to besides problem solving from the core  ,1,NOT
most people don't work fields they got a degree in though i would say a great many men work construction which doesn't necessarily require advanced education and gives by for the most hours worked on a job,1,NOT
these radical feminists don't understand how math works how economy works.,2,NOT
this is one of the best things that ever appeared in my recommend sub earned.,1,NOT
just because a wage gap isn't necessarily 00 the cause of employers intentionally saying to themselves i think i'll pay x group less doesn't mean that wage gap is automatically innocent or rather that only the portion which we can directly connect to an explicit intent to discriminate as the cause of the gap is problematic and/or unfair and/or discriminatory) as the narrator herself points out--there are many possible explanations including factors influencing these choices men and women make as if choices have ever occurred in a vacuum free of human or natural influences on one's considerations one's so-called free choice) it is still entirely possible that the difference in career choices and educational opportunities can be explained less by women's willingness to accept lower compensating fields of work but instead the tendency of the whole society many of those women included yes to segregate and/or self-segregate women in to particular kinds of work and roles that may or may not be paid or paid as much as roles society at least much of society historically has preferred to push men towards and women away from as much as possible--with varying degrees of explicitness).,1,NOT
the most common sense explanation i have come across we have the same problem in the uk media and politicians perpetuating the myth that women are paid less than men for doing the same job i don't get why they want to portray women as victims.,2,NOT
"examples that can't suit every case of inequality you gather different studies to make them saying something that is accorded to your thoughts and so many people do not see that.. apparently this is the lack of criticism in your minds just a guess ^""",1,NOT
love it your someone who spreads the truth,1,NOT
a womans work is never done and that explains the wage gap,3,NOT
"god bless you woman,you speak the truth",1,NOT
i agree with you but why don't you provide your sources it would help in spreading the truth you can find a plethora of falsehoods for any given perpetrated lie however it's only getting harder to find hard statistical data.,1,NOT
first you talk about full time jobs and then yous name one of the things that they don't take into account is hours per week i agree with your point i just find it disapointing that something like this is in here,2,NOT
it is true that women are less likely to choose stem fields but there is a reason for this women are less encouraged to choose these higher paying jobs since their early life they life society discourages them and burdens them with stereotypes therefore they don't choose higher paying jobs because they think men will do better,1,NOT
i don't know what to believe anymore,1,NOT
i work at a pizza ranch this is just how it happens to be but every shift lead and manager is a woman including the owner also most of the women get paid more than i do there.,1,NOT
she says choices create the difference not the wage gap but aren't choices created by the gap in education in the fact that women are often forced to work in less-paid sectors that women more often take care of children and thus spend less time at work this gap is not a myth!,1,NOT

"according to the broadcast why is women's soccer so white? one of the main reasons for it is that that these youth players are preferring to play for clubs rather than just to play high school soccer they see the need to play for clubs because since the women's soccer is not as major as for the men's soccer team despite of how well they perform as compared to the men it was mentioned that some clubs were as high as 7,00 per teenage girl when we compare national team clubs to high school soccer it is notable that not everyone will have that type of money to pay for their girls to go off to play it all has to do with socioeconomic and the parents who have this type of money due to their higher incomes are white thus this is one big reason why there is so little diversity in the women's soccer team shifting to the video there is no gender gap the overall message is that there is only a  wage gap and not more as others make it seem they mention how basically it is the women's fault because of their career options which impacts how much money they make however what they don't realize is that out of all the job options they have there is only 04 of jobs that pay women and men equal so how are they expected to choose wisely when there is hardly any options for them to choose from it is sad to see how even with the same education the gap still remains just because women are seen as less reliant because they are not able to work at all times due to motherhood and all the other household responsibilities women have on top of work they mention how it is not sexism but all of the previous states otherwise how men are more capable of doing certain jobs and they are less of a burden for employers moreover according to adams et al of section classism women's average pay is at 7 of men's compensation throughout their whole career women only make 4 of what men make it was mentioned in the reading how discrimination is part of it but also because women are not always able to work the full time and thus if you need to be absent for a period of time from work it is a stiff penalty in declining their career and slashing the pay the lack of daycare and flexible job options makes it really hard for a woman to work the same amount of hours as a man overall i think it is important to analyze this further and note how it is not that they are not telling us the truth or they are doing bad math they are sharing the actual facts and truth on what women have to deal with.",1,NOT

i'm a retired history teacher when we covered the modern feminist movement i would debunk the wage gap for my students later in the course i would have them pick a social issue facing women today describe the problem and propose a solution a significant percentage of them generally around 0% would write their paper on...... the wage gap!,1,NOT

must not confuse and upset lefties with facts/truth ...it's bigoted and hateful.,2,NOT

just because you don't like girly things doesnt mean youre trans just because you didn't like grown men staring at your boobs doest mean youre trans just because you don't like a role of women and want to be the man and the assertive one doesnt mean youre trans it's okay to not conform to gender roles and still identify as your birthsex it really seem like everyone be forgetting that.,3,NOT
usually i'm not the type to gatekeep but honestly knowing trisha this is the biggest insult to the trans community if this is a joke it's offensive she either wants attention or is confused is she really trying to convince us she has gender dysphoria ???,3,NOT

great i just happened to watch vegan 01 this morning i've been a vegan for precisely  days which is how long it's been since i watched what the health on netflix these movies can turn people because for so many of us we somehow remained in the dark on these truths so powerful they can be instantly life-changing once we realize eating animal products is actually bad for us and we don't need to do it then we no longer need to accept consuming animal products no matter what the rationalization in which case we can see it for what it is it's a complete paradigm shift because most of us have always believed we needed to consume animal products in which case that's just the way things are turns out we don't live in a dog-eat-dog universe but a panda-eat-bamboo universe.,1,NOT

i do love that household chores are listed but yard work isn't how about auto maintenance building projects diy chores i'm a stay at home dad and my wife still does way more household chores than i do but it's not because she's oppressed but because she is willing to clean the whole house if i do the bathroom cleaning the bathroom sucks and it gross but it takes me like an hour a week so i just do it it's the same deal with mowing the lawn i've never brought up doing it to her other than to make the point about what i do around the house because i like doing it i take a great deal of pride in my yard but when it comes to cleaning out the dog kennel bernese mountain dog bernese cross two boston terriers and i run a doggy daycare) that sucks but it still needs to be done again it buys me a lot of chore credit so i accept it and just do it the problem with assessing people's personal choices at home is the lack of context my wife would love to stay home clean the house and take care of children but she got a really good job that turned into a great career and it's not cost effective if women aren't on your equality bandwagon that's fine it's time you stop worrying about such stupid things.,3,NOT
ok guys in traditional households earn more because they work more than women if women wanted to be a sole provider and the man to be the child caretaker that could work but since this is traditional that's how we get the average,2,NOT
have you forgotten about how men work more hours and that they are more productive and officient in the work place plus men take up the most work place fatalities because us men take up the more dangerous jobs like building or the military you didn't state this in the video and i think that you are choosing sides here vox.,3,NOT
one piece of data that i would really like to see is some measure of the actual productivity vs wage gap thing that might be hard to get for some fields but for others like sales or something there ought to be a straightforward way to get actual productivity metrics to compare in order to defeat/confirm the theory that the wage gap is actually due to a performance gap.,3,NOT
if ppl could get away with paying women less then they would just hire women.,3,NOT
i love how there weren't any of the more dangerous fields being studied any chance you could look into things like construction or law enforcement plenty of openings we'll always need more masons and police so it's not like there's a limit on jobs there.,3,NOT

aaaaand yet again a clearly feminist outlet obscures some important facts one men are expected to earn as much as possible to be viable partners two working longer hours equates to job experience three child rearing and household duties require availability and men being expected to earn the bulk of the household income directly negates that four  percent of unsheltered homeless are men five more than  percent of workplace morbidities/fatalities are men six men on average work an extra to hours a week seven millenial women are outearning their male peers it's interesting that people that clutch the wage gap so close to their heart never address these issues.,3,NOT

"when i saw the title what people miss about the gender wage gap"" i thought it would talk about how blatantly the wage gap is calculated by just dividing the average earning of a male by the average earning of the counterpart female) but nooo this video along with certain feminists yes not all feminists are alike just like how all muslims aren't terrorists) politicians and celebrities completely ignore the fact that some women choose different careers and work hours hey by the way the number of employed men that are alive should also different from the number of existing employed women well that's just a hunch and i'm 4 so judge what you will) furthermore just for a second let's assume that the wage gap is in fact real and women get paid 7c for every dollar a male makes that said why for what reason don't all companies hire only women since it is 3c cheaper than hiring a male don't companies want the most bang for their buck and not spend more money than they have to this would save tens of thousands maybe millions of dollars every year if their workforce only was comprised of women well who knows anyways i am not trying to diss women here please that is not the message i am trying to get across if that is how you feel i apologize) moreover i do concede that women do work less than men in most cases due to their schedule and that is what this video talks about and that is what we should be worrying about and for that reason i did not dislike the video but nor did i give it a thumbs up so fighting to get rid of the stereotypical notion that women should be at home solely responsible for the kids is the real war we should be fighting and we are we are progressing but we are obviously not there yet and everyone should be contributing this also isn't just about women but everything that concerns another human's well being paraphrased from mlk) so there isn't anything wrong about a feminist or any advocate for that matter as long as you are well educated so what i'm trying to say is earning does not equal wage cookiopuss ps youtuber) neither is the earth flat and thanks for reading all of this if you did.",3,NOT
male logic translation women make choices that affect their income negatively while men do whatever it takes to clime the corporate ladder the wage gap is a myth here is proof if you are a c.e.o and you can hire women at  cents on the hour to the dollar an hour a man works for the same output in labor who will you hire if you want to get rich the answer will always be the woman since she is cheaper labor that is simple economics folks the reason that woman are not dominating the workforce because of this logical choice is because they make decisions that adversely affect their work performance taking time off to raise kids and inflexible schedules is bad for business so you make less for those reasons ladies no man is oppressing you you did it to yourselves so maybe quit blaming your bad choices on men ok also just so we are clear paying a woman less for the same work is discrimination and there are laws against it since you never hear of women winning lawsuits then these companies obviously are not in violation of said law so your wage gap argument is invalid.,3,NOT

so the message here is that guys are lazy yeah i'll believe that,3,NOT
from most studies i've read through the data seems to always point towards childbirth most women have to take quite a few weeks off because of this phenomena so when they return their income tends to lessen compared to if they didn't therefore one of the easier ways to end the wage gap is to give paid family leave to the mothers and fathers so the wages don't decrease upon the parents return to work this will also add a much healthier relationship between fathers and their children and take the edge off of the average working class wife who has to return to their job after giving birth to realize her salary has just dropped compared to their coworkers.,1,NOT
i once worked as a punch press operator for about months the guy before me got his hand shredded in one of the machines i saw the pictures and i was surprised that the doctors were able to put it together at all the job was  hours a day or days a week to have enough time to make food in the morning and get to work on time i woke up at am there was only one woman that i ever saw there and she came in about once a week to help with accounting.,1,NOT
paygap isnt real btw,2,NOT

wait one year out of business school were these people working at the same facility or were they employed by two different companies who pay differently and is it possible that the men strived for higher paying jobs to better support a family hmm i wonder why these studies are so inaccurate also if employers could get away with paying employees less why wouldn't every company hire woman?,1,NOT
lasted  seconds most annoying voice eve...eeeeeerrrrrrrr.,2,NOT
great video i just wonder why sarah kliff said that the finding of claudia goldin :40 is really cute.,1,NOT
it has to do with life choice its not les per hr its less per year ie less work put in per year,1,NOT
nice vid vox is usually kinda bad at this sort of stuff so what we learned the wage gap is a non issue and personal choice is the reason for it.,1,NOT
it shows how much they make a year not how much they work my wife make  more a hr then me but i made 5k more then she did.,1,NOT
earnings gap not wage gap earning key words here vox,1,NOT
men have testosterone which makes then more aggressive this means that in the business world especially they will fight more for a better position.,1,NOT
look if you wanna earn as much as or more than men work as many hours work jobs with the same payment and don't take more vacations.. simple,1,NOT
why the dislikes are people denying the wage gap again?,1,NOT
i'm sorry but this video is misleading it does however kind of show how even with years of data and statistics you can manipulate the truth.,1,NOT
why do you talk like thaaat?,1,NOT
you will close the wage gap between genders to  if you are as productive as men.,1,NOT
urban legend men work more hours end of debate ,1,NOT
women work part time a lot and the people that do these statistics count them as working in the same place but dishonestly do not include hours worked because that would destroy there pay gap narrative cooking the books one might say,1,NOT
i'm a business owner in it communications field i would love to pay less to my employees and hire them all women if i could pay them less but women employees are the worst ones to be on call they usually will not bother staying the th hour to finish a project i even have written complaints from the female employees themselves about - hours overtime i'm not sure what do i not see.. plus women really don't know how to negotiate for the salary just saying.,1,NOT
if a girl wants to make as much money as a guy she should put in the effort to get the same education and job.,2,NOT
i'm willing to bet that vox chose a study that focused on high-income earners because at low-income brackets there is almost no wage gap.,2,NOT
women don't work overtime equally with men...,2,NOT
nice femenist video on something that does not exist,2,NOT
if these feminists want equality.. then why don't these feminists get mad about how women almost always win custody cases,2,NOT
kids ruin everything but thanks for getting into the nuance of the issue.,2,NOT
so we're just going to ignore the fact that men work longer than women work harder jobs than women and are more likely to ask for raises and promotions?,1,NOT
not to mention the rate of dangerous work spaces and work fatalities for men compared to women is much higher,1,NOT
4k bigots disliked this video.,3,NOT
[insert wall of text trying to disprove the wage gap even though the video does it],2,NOT
basically this relies on reasons women don't ask for promotion women work fewer hours women prefer different jobs,1,NOT
men must be doing better work otherwise who would hire a man for higher pay if the outcome is the same logic is logical.,2,NOT
feminists can't complain on this video,1,NOT
i dont see anything wrong with this video edit the circumstances of which this video is complaining about or inciting should change. the reasons for the pay gap make sense and in a capitalist society especially in business economies which are driven by competition men seem more capable to meet the demand made by those companies that are competing with other companies hence there are more men in these economies than women and the men achieve higher and better paying positions because they have the damn time to it's not like a woman cant achieve fair pay i think we are doing better than ever by far when it comes to equality of opportunity but how does it make sense to alter the function of a business in a competition based economy just to fit a post modernist perspective of egalitarianism why should the outcome be equal if the factors aren't?,1,NOT
needless to say that more flexible hours are awesome for everyone not just ppl with children.,1,NOT
great content vox keep it up i like where this channel is going no bullshit facts and stats.,1,NOT
definition of wage income received by employees usually headed on actual work done men work alit more than women usually and are nine times more likely to die in work than women less work less money,1,NOT
do people not get it is illegal to actually pay someone less for the same job in the us people actually think women get paid less hourly in the same job opposed to men.,1,NOT
men work harder.,2,NOT
thomas sowell debunked this a long time ago lol,1,NOT
so much bullshit in this video who falls for this crap hey vox why not use facts and be truthful for once oh yeah doesn't fit the agenda.,2,NOT
so you have to somehow make companies and corporations to change their work ethic for women to shrink the pay gap the median shows that there are less woman making high wages compared to men and vox even admits that having kids greatly effects it having kids is a choice isn't it?needing flexible hours to accommodate taking care of your kid was a thing that happened to choice why must we actively try to change the wage gap if it doesn't even determine how successful a woman can be a solution could be to have more woman that don't have kids and dedicate lots of their time to work the wage gap is essentially not even oppressive but rather showing of how family systems tend to work it all comes down to whether or not you will settle down for a family or continuously put your knife to the grindstone.,1,NOT
wow great video this time vox glad you stopped being cancer ),2,NOT
prager u did a good video about this a little biased but good facts some of the same things said.,1,NOT
great video vox whenever i watch one of your vids i always learn something new!,1,NOT
"i'm also interested in how race plays into this i read from a few sources that latina and black women make much less than asian and white women but that was a long time ago,",2,NOT
i don't even need to read these comments to know they will be full of fuckboys,2,NOT
flexible non-standard hours are better across the board as a consumer/customer i don't want to have to do things during business hours i want to be able to go for a routine doctor's appointment at pm on a thursday night or call my realtor and go tour houses at am on a monday or go out clubbing on a sunday morning doing stuff at set times/days/hours is stupid.,2,NOT
i was expecting bullshit propaganda.. good on you vox.,2,NOT
wage gap isnt even real,1,NOT
wait no they earned 0 less 00k to 50k not 0% unless you mean 0 the amount that men make.,1,NOT
her vocal fry is extremely annoying.,2,NOT
feminist men get paid more then women me wow the world one make belief!,2,NOT
can we like this so we let vox know we like when they make factual videos,1,NOT
the wage gap is shrinking as women are having kids at an older age because honestly looking after kids can be very full on  it can be hard work but women should be allowed to choose to have kids without getting fire from angry people,1,NOT
i don't think people realise that it's tough on women because they want more help with looking after kids and its tough on men who want to spend more time with their kids thanks society )),1,NOT
my mother earns 0 less than every man in her bureau even tho she's  and has way more experience she works as an architect so she could even do the work at home and it is completely normal that she earns 0 less.,1,NOT
wow vox used full data sets for once good for them for real good for them.,1,NOT
it's an awesome video _ and we should really work on this to make people's lives better.. i just want to put something out there there is no wage gap inside the same company for the same position it's always about the average of different companies and different jobs but yeah still we should do our best to make things better _^,1,NOT
well at least this was far better than the proposals from general feminists.,2,NOT
another choice communism,2,NOT
wage gap doesn't exist,1,NOT
wait so vox is uploading this but continues to upload 016ish.. bit contradicting,2,NOT
"wages and earnings are not the same thing men and women have the same wages there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap because men do make more money only because they choose to do more difficult jobs and do more overtime and work more hours and take less breaks/days off and ask for raises more often women don't make as much money because they are not hard workers it has nothing to do with muh patriarchy""",1,NOT
this video sucked,2,NOT
got to say it is funny how these studies only look at less common and higher paying jobs i would love to see data from more common job sectors.,2,NOT
that it ain't real end of video,1,NOT
women are not as good as men at the highly technical and engineering related roles that generally pay the most for most people the reason why they are not as good is probably because they are not as intereseted in those roles for all sorts of biological reaons even though most women who enter those roles then enter management or quit as opposed to most men who stay motivated on the technical side less women as a whole enter management because of the starting numbers so the gender pay gap is not a gender gap but a talent gap people who take career breaks for family reasons who are not as nerdy/autistic and as a result achieve less and have less experience in short they are less valuable in the business world and thus are paid less people who are aggressive obsessed about their career position thick skinned enjoy being manipulative with borderline socipathic tendancies do well in powerful very high paying life dominating management positons can those traits be attributed to gender?,1,NOT
is this a valley girl accent?,1,NOT
their's no wage gap.,1,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap it doesn't exist.,2,NOT
how to get rich as a woman study why men are richer than women inb triggered jokes m8,2,NOT
why are you surpressing your voice at the end of almost every sentence its kind of annoying,2,NOT
yes what people aren't told is that the wage gap doesn't exist it's a income gap.,1,NOT
so basically the summary of this video is that wage gap exists because women work fewer hours with less paid time periods because they have children and because they tend to gravitate toward jobs with lower pay in other words men don't earn more because they are men but because they work more.,1,NOT
"""women take on a disproportionate share of child-rearing tasks"".. including pregnancy?",1,NOT
i think that we have finally gotten to a point where a person man or woman can become whatever they'd like to be.,1,NOT
it's simple women don't wanna work jobs like engineers and lawyers i go to an engineering school and the ratio is about  percent guys and  percent girls but when you look at the engineering classes the ratio is about  to  in favor of men.,1,NOT
women should get paid equally to men when they decide to work as hard as men annoyed ladies well blame yourselves and start working harder instead of spending your working time gossiping like wh***s.,2,NOT
i'm glad and kinda surprised you didn't immediately jump to sexism as the primary explanation refreshing.,1,NOT
curious to know if the study showing the shrinking gender wage gap in older women took into account women who left the work force to raise their children and never made it back in.,1,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap the gap i guess there isn't one how could there be every company would either be in court all the time or would only employ women since they are cheaper this wage gap bullshit is feminist translation sexist propaganda.,2,NOT
women get to spend more time with their family they have better lives men work themselves literally to death is our goal to work more or spend time with family forget wage or earning gap and let's look at quality of life gap.,1,NOT
did vox just admit that the wage gap exists due to the choices of women and not sexist discrimination do they realize that this means the wage gap is a non issue?,1,NOT
she keeps switching from median salary to average salary which i'm guessing is to the benefit of her argument.,1,NOT
we don't have a gender pay gap we have a gender wage gap when we say that there is no pay gap that means that in the united states men and women are paid the same for instance if they're getting offered a job as a starting position at mcdonald's or a teacher at a public school it's illegal to discriminate on the basis of race gender or any other condition men and women are being paid the same in all hourly paid jobs but how much many men and women choose to work and how they work is the difference aside from women not even participating in certain strenuous industries like construction or landscaping where a lot of physical labor is required and there is a lot of money to be made women are also not keen to do jobs that are high-paying and heavy in mathematics and sciences as proved by college degree acquisitions modern women have had access to college for decades now and women are now the majority in college participation in the united states and yet women still steer clear from math and science degrees the women are choosing that nobody is stopping women from getting that boring math calculus or rocket science class these disparities are more than enough to account for the difference in how much the average woman and man earns in america now specifically to this video the most important issue is female psychology the idea that women don't want to work in general many women may value their alone time and prefer to have down time they may not want to work as many hours as men do not just for children but for their own personal development i know that not all women fit this archetype in fact the hardest working person i knew that used to work everyday two jobs was a woman so there certainly are busy-bee women out there that's not most women though most women don't want to be workaholics and more men are prone to being workaholics what i think is interesting is that even in this video we see this aspect of women wanting to avoid work playing out in this video we see how the way to improve things would be to make things more flexible and that men should do more housework in other words this video is pandering to the people who want things to be made easier for them make things easier on me it's too hard to work hours a day make it hours and give us more vacation and more money this is exactly the attitude that i'm talking about when i say that many men and women simply don't want to work or are always looking to push their work away a true mother wouldn't bemoan all the hours she spends caring for her children a person that loves to work wouldn't be thinking about when the next time they get off is gonna come we're talking about different psychologies here this isn't even to do with women or men because i've seen hardworking individuals on both sides and people who prefer doing recreational activities who are both males and females it's just that our culture happens to promote female recreational attitudes a bit more the reality is under a free market the hardworking people are going to outcompete and outclass the people who want more recreation in general that's the trade off that people who want more free time must make more free time equals less money under equal circumstances this video makes it look as if wanting free time or wanting more recreation is even desirable do you realize there are workaholics who never take any vacations and who never even have a day off and still have time to take care of their multiple kids let alone or kids that the average female worker has let the workers work let the market give the job to the men and women who actually want to work without complaining.,1,NOT
does vox pay their employees equally?,1,NOT
what the hell man you can't state it's factually correct then give the reasons why it not women of the world mainly first world stop with your victim complex it's not a wage gap it's an earnings gap,1,NOT
way to go vox way to be unbiased.,2,NOT
yes there is a gender wage gap but its simply because men choose different types of careers women generally choose lesser paying jobs its that simple also men usually work longer or take fewer vacations,1,NOT
lies gender equality is already a thing propaganda,2,NOT
oh no you guys women are only earning two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year whatever will these businesswomen and scientists do?!?!? i swear between this and jennifer lawrence complaining about her pay this looks like an exclusive problem of the rich the rest of humanity all have job titles and somewhere in hr there is a big chart that says what each job title gets per hour.,2,NOT
"-never watch video go on to posting opinion about the wage gaps existence""-",2,NOT
wtf 00k usd per year whaat,1,NOT
ok so it seems that since woman choose to take on more extra responsibilities that they don't have to take on they can't work as much getting less pay fair,1,NOT
in short the wage gap is women making the decision to work less and shock getting paid less as a result.,1,NOT
"+vox is wage the rate which employees are paid per time given/project ex 20/hr 1000/project) or is it the accumulated money earned with a specific range of time ex yearly monthly) as for the pew research about share of house work did it account if the mother and father both working full time have equal or close earning potential if a father who earns 100,00 in a year while the mother earns 50,00 in a year wouldn't it be logical if the mother bear the brunt of house hold chores while the father takes the opportunity to push his career for bigger paycheck i would say it is the first time i saw a study that tackles gender gap in careers and actually use appropriate data.",1,NOT
this is intellectualized propaganda very cute.,2,NOT
this girl's vocal fry is really annoying,2,NOT
there is waaay more to it than even shown here basically the gender wage gap is not a myth.... it's a damn lie!!!,2,NOT
stop going into gender studies so you can get a job that actually matters,2,NOT
as a female i do notice a wage gap but for all i know it's a result of the male wanting to negotiate more on salary and the company's health could also have played a role because he was hired later after about a year or two of working for the company another female was hired who made a little less than me and hadn't even finished her degree.,1,NOT
if the wage gap was real then companies would fire all the men and hire women,1,NOT
wow vox you actually did research.. congrats,2,NOT
the wage gap is a lie,1,NOT
sounds like a personal problem to me.,2,NOT
wage gap stats so you aren't a subscriber to wage gap but that some discrimination may exist and that it can and will be dealt with in the courts right?,2,NOT
imagine if vox was forced by law to not lie to the stupid women are paid the same as men for the same job.,2,NOT
is vox saying the same thing that that kid from google said.. and wasn't he fired for saying it?,2,NOT
while everyone else is arguing about the wage gap i'm sitting here wondering how graduates only year out of business school are making between 15k 30k on average...,1,NOT
we need to show this to everyone and give this amazing woman an award for being so awesome!,1,NOT
who else came here to just see the feminist's comments?,1,NOT
you'll get paid the same if you do as good of a job,1,NOT
there is no wage gap it it proven that women take off more time and work less hours then men.,1,NOT
at least somebody has made an effort to get the facts out. stupid celebrities and their sheep!,1,NOT
holly shit prager u seems to have gotten something right?!! wow... just wow of course they didn't get here through a critical analysis of evidence but rather because in this one case the evidence does not contradict their political narrative seeeerrriously can we dispense with fake universities now or should we elect another con artist president or two first?,2,NOT
in a nutshell it's a canadian women vs american man because american dollar=0.7 canadian dollar,2,NOT
great video good explanation the left is not interested in facts at all!,2,NOT
"just wanted to know when 0 of 400,00 became 150,000 because i'm pretty sure that math just is not correct.",1,NOT
2:5 that's the stupidest chart i've ever seen....,2,NOT
i can definitely show my respect to a well conducted actual research on the topic even if it comes from people with differing political opinions that kind of research is what has to be spread about all topics ideology should stop to be the main point of a party they should rather focus on facts and how to improve the situation using proved methods.,1,NOT
do these statistics take into account the amount of work each gender does?,1,NOT
in addition to making more flexible hours we should try to create a society where women and men are expected to take equal roles in child caring.,1,NOT
my sister just got triggered when i showed this to her,2,NOT
surprised to hear that pay is based on ability to work and not sex.,1,NOT
please watch the video before you disliking,1,NOT
last summer i worked as a waiter at a college one month i got paid 15 more than one of my counterparts who just happened to be a woman modern feminism would look at this and say that the college i worked for was sexist as me being a male earned more than my female counterpart what they would overlook is the fact that i worked more over time and didn't take any of my earned holiday and so was compensated for it at the end of the month i did this not because men work harder but because i had student debt to pay off) in this case i was on the exact same salary about 1 an hour and was contracted for  hours a week this is a prime example of how the wages and earnings are two totally different things you can be on the same salary but have different incomes depending on holidays taken and overtime worked its a shame feminism has gotten caught up in this hysterical regressive liberal movement as feminism is one of the greatest triumphs of the 0th century,1,NOT
this seems a lot less opinionated then most of the facts i hear most other feminists rant about.,1,NOT
you can't close the wage gap if you want to earn more as a woman don't have kids or make the man do more for your kid you must be a dumb ass not figure that one out don't use the wage gap as a thing for argument sort your own wages and get a union fuckface,1,NOT
we as women deserve more money we clearly are earning less than men and treated unfairly,1,NOT
considering that paying a women less because they are a woman is illegal the lack of lawsuits is self-evident to the existence of a wage gap.,1,NOT
curious as to why this is such a huge issue you'd have to look very to find any two groups who earn the same amount asian men make more than white men white women earn more than black women what is being about these differences what about the gaps between us citizens and german citizens why is one earning less it seems like one group is wanting special treatment.,1,NOT
oh please world goverments internetional bodies like the un oecd world bank and imf and leading banks and financial institutions all confirm the wage gap is real economists who have spent their entire lives studying the way gap and know a hell alot more about it than a 'resident scholar' of a right-wing think tank and edgy teens who have never worked a day in their life another ignorant video even the first argument 'why don't firms only hire women?' is a fallacy that totally ignores logistics demographics and skill levels not to mention the oecd found even factoring in 'work choices hours leave etc' still leaves a nearly -10 wage gap and forget off-the-books gender discrimination opening your eyes to the obvious conservative agenda being forced here.,1,NOT
if the wage gap were real business owners would hire a lot more women so they could cut their costs by paying them less) this would increase the demand for cheap female workers and drive wages down for men who are trying to compete.,1,NOT
"1:0 250,00 is not 0 less than 400,000 it is 2.5 of 400,00 but only 7.5 less still a large amount less but not as much as 0 less.",1,NOT
i should be able to work hour a week in an noncompetitive industry and get as much as tim cook all jobs are equal,1,NOT
so in other words the wage gap is an illusion,1,NOT
the liberals are mad,2,NOT
man i wish liberals would watch this they wouldn't have a response because the gap doesn't exist,2,NOT
seems like vox isn't liberally biased anymore i'll subscribe again.,1,NOT
somewhere in the world there is a buddhist who have finally attained true inner peace and has founded harmony and all answers to life just before he dies he leaves us with vital piece of information and it is vox causes mentally retardation and with that he died with a smile on his face that is a 00 true and verified story by the new york post the washington post and the daily report and don't bother researching this either i did all the work for you just take the buddhist man's advice on vox 00 causing mental retardation.,1,NOT
nice now instead of spending countless hours arguing i just send this video easy to understand excellently made and covers many many things thanks.,1,NOT
i feel like everyone should watch this and then open their mouths to speak,1,NOT
this channel is the greatest thing i've ever seen,1,NOT
i guess i'm just lucky enough my parents taught me to value even the smallest amount of money even if there was/is a gender pay gap just be thankful you got paid at all p,1,NOT
why do women chose lower paying professions at a higher percentage than men?,1,NOT
then theres the question on why womeon get the not as high paying jobs,1,NOT
the only reason feminists talk about the wage gap is because they just want higher pay.,1,NOT
now we should ask ourselves why are women in less paid jobs and that is not only because of choise only a small fragment of ceos and other high managing positions are female while studies suggest that women in leading positions are often better suited for these than men for example it is very likely that the 00 bank chrash happened majorly only due to male hormones and that way to much risk taking while women prefer to play it safe so now why is there this difference in leading positions i can not imagine any other way but sexism.,1,NOT
vox disproving the wage gap i can't believe it,1,NOT
i feel like there's a good argument here but it seems like they're saying women make less than men for the same job unless i missed something i thought that was illegal.,1,NOT
what people miss about the gender pay gap . it does not exist,1,NOT
love these women not cheap hole fem,2,NOT
is there any scientific proof for a correlation between the wage gap and the flexibility of the job?,1,NOT
when vox makes a video about the wage gap but then gets hit with reality in the comments,2,NOT
:5 unexplained wage gap i have an explanation . to percent of us companies are stuck in the dark ages just a thought.,2,NOT

i'm surprised theology and religious vocations is only 6 male there's no money in that field for women why would any woman choose that field ,1,NOT
the  cents on the dollar is not correct and tooken from a study that has a basis,1,NOT
don't forget women that choose career over family are more likely to be depressed.,1,NOT
you are doing the work of god,1,NOT
can someone please correct me if im wrong so there is no such thing as a wage gap however there is an income gap and this is based on choice people make with women birthing babies and all mostly staying home or only working part time hence earning an income equal to 9c for ever male dollar and there is no job that a women actually gets paid less then a man for the same work just looking for some clarification is all,1,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap is that it doesn't exist,1,NOT
not perfect but good on you vox.,1,NOT
mrs sommers is a legend,1,NOT
extreamlh important to hear it for a woman thank you,1,NOT
you need more info.hours worked the same position not just a doctor but what type of doctor etc,1,NOT
i used this video in my global perspectives class for high school as a counter to the arguments made by my teacher it was good to see some free thinking and fair debate.,1,NOT
stop with the wage gap nonsense there will always be a gap between groups that's the real world.,1,NOT
please don't listen to this it's fake.,2,NOT
however many likes this gets are the number of days i will go without masturbating.,1,NOT
even if the wage gap did exist why would anyone want to be a feminist in today's age good and true feminism died in the 970s now feminism is about man hating egalitarianism is the way to go.,2,NOT
respect the wamen,1,NOT
i love it when women are talking about how the wage gap is false these women are smart as hell and it just throws egg on the faces of these feminists.,1,NOT
the wage gap is a myth!!!,1,NOT
businesses would hire men for more money because their work is valued more it's like hiring someone who is untrained just because they will take minimum wage instead of paying more for someone who is trained,1,NOT
somthing tells me vox doesn't factor in certain facts for certain reasons.,2,NOT
warning might be trollz below,2,NOT
wait so the fact that women can have kids makes them less deserving of an equal wage?,1,NOT
hmmm i like feminism makes entire video about false statistic,2,NOT
the wage gap doesn't exist.,1,NOT
i don't really believe gender wage gap is real never had a job with a girl that we both had the same job and we were paid different,1,NOT
"is there any valid argument in existence that can actually prove there is a wage gap because from where i'm sitting grade math where you learn mean,median and mode can easily solve this myth why is this dead horse still being beat??",2,NOT
well i was going to comment but the video was so badly researched it made me vomit,2,NOT
men are also more competitive and ask for more promotions and raises men work more hours than women overall.,1,NOT
it's not like women are statistically more educated,2,NOT
if i get hored at mcdonald's and a woman gets hired at mcdonald's for the same position we will both get payed minimum wage i don't see a wage gap there,1,NOT
dont listen brainwashed liberals,2,NOT
surprisingly unbiased video informative and factual good job vox!,1,NOT
so what you're saying is that it's not a wage gap but it's because jobs don't have flexible hours good to know.,1,NOT
what they miss about it is its nonexistence,2,NOT
i was shook i thought this was going to be a pandering video but it was actually factual.,1,NOT
i can't even imagine how many triggered feminists fill the comments,2,NOT
the wage gap ended like - years ago if you see women making less it has nothing with gender or maybe its just the job,1,NOT
maybe women choose different life choices because men and women are different on average not because of sexism which is what the wage gap myth/argument implies maybe women want to parent and care for the household more than men in general and men want to got out into the world and bring home sustainance more than women in general why should anyone care about closing the wage gap when their is merely a difference in choices not a difference in opportunities infact women are currently given far more opportunities than men and women overall still choose differently than how wage gap apologists want them to.,1,NOT
what this means is that the wage gap is voluntary based on sick american female culture women choose a man and they decide how to spend hours so sick male culture gets involved too misogyny and misandry coexist and as a white male i feel demonized far more than i see women exploited since my birth in1992.,1,NOT
this is one of the only vox videos i dont hate good job,1,NOT
the gender wage gap is bullshit,2,NOT
everyone that says oh if women are cheaper then why won't i hire a full women staff? yall are the dumbest kids online if you watched the video you would learn that due to hours needed by a women in her 0-30s it would be seen as unprofitable for you to hire all female staff that's how american business calculates it between the potential maternity paid leave and hours a female employee might try to take of american business don't want female employees typically did you not pay attention to the whole video and i say american business because apparently we are the only country in the world that doesn't have by law paid maternity leave.,1,NOT
feminist will now complain that they do more in the household now....great,2,NOT
are men usually expected to support the house more so than the woman is expected to? include all factors please,1,NOT
not a complete lie but women can't expect to get the same amount of money after being knocked up and in maternity vacation for several months or times in their career,2,NOT
not shown in the video the ethnicity of women playing into it as well,1,NOT
the main argument here is that the wage gap exists because women do more housework and childcare duties therefore they can't focus on their careers as much as a man who does less childcare and housework. the problem with this is that it assumes women are forced into this role by the patriarchy and they don't want to be the main childcare provider by their own choice.. which is largely not true of course there are individual situations where it may be the case that the man wants to do more or equal childcare to the woman and that couple is free to factor that into the way they situate their lives which i'm sure does happen already) but by and large most women prefer to do more of the childcare and let the man do more of the bread-winning so they can spend their time with their child while they're growing up and less slaving away at work while the child is with a someone else.. and both parents are doing this willingly as what they see as the best way to raise the child.. and of course no one wants to do housework generally speaking but whoever is home more will obviously be the one to do more housework.. in this case women are home more so they end up doing more i'm a woman in a thankfully childless relationship with a man and i make more and therefore he does more housework and takes care of the animals where as most of my coworkers who are nearly all female mothers prefer to work less and stay home with their kids like i described and i am an exception of sorts also the single mom issue is a totally separate situation that wasn't addressed in this video and i will say that they tend to be royally screwed because they can't focus all their time on children or on their careers which is why a free to hire government salary nanny would be a great thing to incorporate into the usa basing it off of how it's done in france that way the single moms pay wouldn't go right back into baby sitting while they're trying to make a profit on top of all their other bills and expenses that come with children._,1,NOT
too bad it didn't mention a lot more nuances of the gap and still had the slightly sexist edge to it but whatevs,2,NOT
most of the money men make is spent on or by women anyway,3,NOT
i'm very tired as of now and what i'm getting out of this is that most women who are earning less are doing so because many of them have children to take care of so they're missing hours the solution is that work hours could be made more flexible is that what she's saying here if so couldn't a better solution be to raise the wage of women with children who are single/unsupported please note that i am not very educated in this field so i'm just making a solution based on what i've observed from this video p,1,NOT
ima start a business of just women and pay women 1 less profits will be booming!,2,NOT
inafter angry mostly white guys who are triggered by the idea that anyone other than them might actually enjoy less privilege and consideration than they do.. look angry alt-righters and misogynists you dont need to give anything up by admitting that the tables are stacked in your favor it doesnt reflect poorly on you it simply means that like a rational person would you acknowledge that white dudes have an easier time of it than anyone else because historically thats been literally indisputably true im the child of two white lawyers who are very successful but guess what they recognize how advantaged they are and fight to end things like income inequality based on race and recognize that things like institutional racism are real things again you mustn't give up anything privelege race identity politics and basic human decency aren't zero sum games!!!,2,NOT
i'm a bit confused so the wage gap exists but is different in different job fields or does it not exist,1,NOT
look at all of the dislikes it is pathetic if you don't like facts you have no place here and no place in any discussion or debate.,1,NOT
earning is the word you are looking for,1,NOT
"1,70 triggered femininsts who don't like facts disliked.",2,NOT
a balanced video people still offended.,1,NOT
the gender wage gap does not take into consideration how many hours people work or what job they work,1,NOT
it's weird that women are often penalized for getting pregnant it's how the species continues folks,1,NOT
all these debates huge sums of invested money research companies fields of social sciences faculties on university and college campuses yet you can pretty much explain any gender debate in a free and civilized society with two words biological determinism boom done.,1,NOT
i think what most are missing from this video is that the wage gap is inherently caused by culture and the disproportionate effect children have on women vs men the wage gap problem is an apples to oranges issue because its caused by forces primarily outside of the workplace but we see its effects as the average wages between men and women what vox is trying to say is that to fix this inequality we should approach it by giving women more opportunities to balance this extra demand placed on them or some how alleviate it through policy whether its better childcare maternity and paternity leave to allow the father more time to help or more flexible work hours its not about trying to pay women more to compensate but by giving them the tools to be on an equal footing which i think we can all agree with.,1,NOT
why do you even care about the earnings gap what problem do you have with women making conscious choices to work part time raise kids take more sick/vacation days etc dividing people into groups instead of treating everyone like an individual is what keeps us separated.,1,NOT
so if you want to make more money don't have kids problem solved.,1,NOT
people saying it doesn't exist are wrong it is definitely exaggerated though not to mention that all the statistics around this are outdated we should be looking at what women going in to the workforce right now can expect to make compared to their male peers in the same profession the fact that they were using people from different professions is ridiculous there are more women in universities today than men so it stands to reason eventually women will have a higher median income especially considering the lack of women in lower paying labor jobs but no-one will say it's sexist then.,1,NOT
sorry but the wage gap doesn't exist.,1,NOT
the gender pay gap is a myth simple as that,1,NOT
you can't lower something that does not exist,1,NOT
i figured it out how to get through to you take out the dangerous jobs nobody wants to do that men do that women don't then add all the job positions men and women do adding them all up to get 00 and 00 showing they make the same amount for the same jobs positions next show the dangerous choices of work that men do that women choose not to after you figure out it is the same pay it will show from men's choices of dangerous jobs that it adds up to 4 for men to who choose dangerous jobs women choose not to do leaving it out of the 00%/100 equation let the 4 set off to the side by men choosing to do dangerous jobs women choose not to do by averages of pay do not add this to 00 because it is choices of work vs pay now wait for it..,1,NOT
no matter what the gap still exists at some extent its still an issue just not nearly as bad as some people make it look.,1,NOT
those who claim that the wage gap does depend on more factors then just gender btw i dont believe in the wage gap wil then say that there is still sexism because woman care for children and thus cant work first im sorry to be that guy but biology sort of decided that or god if u like fairytales because woman mentally and physically are better at child caring then men who are better at hard work and hunting for the family to survive and second i believe that just like here in europe families should get paid when a woman cant work so its still fair so when a child is born the man can work and woman gets some money but less and the company the woman works for doesnt have to pay the woman but gets a cut of the money that would go to the woman so the woman wont get fired and thus chaos within the household wont happen and a child can growup with the attention of a mother which it needs,1,NOT
2:1 :3 you don't say...,1,NOT
it's just biology having a kid is a choice a woman must make and yea there are consequences good and bad money isn't everything.,1,NOT

lol are you kidding if this is true why don't all business hire only women to save money?,1,NOT
vox finally catching on to reality?,1,NOT
wage gap does not exist,1,NOT
poor families are two income families while rich families are one income families where usually the man works  hours per week while the woman stays at home managing the household and that's mostly because those women want that if the relationship is new and the guy loses his job and can't find a good one and doesn't get a good income anymore there's a big chance she will find another boyfriend . that's how men are stimulated to put a lot of care into their career the same way that women are stimulated to put a lot of care into their looks what this means is that women from rich environments often choose not to work while poor women often don't have that choice and a result a larger percentage of working women come from poor environments that is the primary reason why men get payed more it has absolutely nothing to do with men having more chances the only places they might have more chances is in top business functions sports or acting or careers like that where salary is entirely arbitrary but this is only relevant to at most  of the population.,1,NOT
thank you vox for helping the cause focus on the real problem it's not that companies are flat out sexist and don't pay women the same pay it's because of our culture and society and difference on personal preference i hope that this video will help the cause get back on track following the facts.,1,NOT
so...why didn't you include other factors such as  men on average work - hours more a week them women  men on average work more overtime or stay late  men take less time off  men are much more likely to ask for a promotion/raise also i like how you kinda glossed over the fact that women get pregnant...but ya thats a thing a pretty major one at that.,1,NOT
atleast in sweden the real wage gap just taking gender discrimination in to account is about -  which is bad but not the 3 wich many sjv's say.,1,NOT
if a woman works just as much as her husband and is still doing most/all of the housework then it's on her to tell her husband that she needs more help from him that sounds like a relationship issue not a pay gap issue.,1,NOT
stupid feminist pigs,3,NOT

are we talking pay before deductions or after this is just as important as the rest of it.,1,NOT
when a woman has a child she becomes a mother so how could the father provide more then the mother a woman provides different love than a man that's just how it is sorry to say but men and women are simply not equal in velpoe never ever be equal women have babies men do not have babies.,1,NOT
feminist will only listen to females but when men tells them they're wrong it somehow turns into sexual abuse -.,2,NOT
not much to miss about something that doesn't exist.,1,NOT

damn it vox don't make me like one of your videos.,1,NOT
now being a mom is damaging for women that kind of ideas are breaking families what we need to do it is to appreciate the importance of women as moms it is an integral part of our society i am not saying that men doesn't need to help more but you can't deny that there are things that only moms can do give birth breast-feeding etc.,1,NOT
to the guys saying career women shouldn't have a family or get pregnant if they want the same wage then you guys would be fine if all the women decided not to have your babies until they turned 0y old right or if they decided never to have sex until they wanted to have a child w you which meant you'd have to be in a committed relationship cause it seems that's the only option women are being given.,1,NOT
this video wasn't terrible you actually acknowledge that women gone into more less paying jobs than men and that they are more likely to stay at home with their kids instead of staying overtime at work i honestly expected this video to be garbage but it was actually decent.,1,NOT
at :0 did anyone notice the funny jobs like blimp pilot crossword puzzle writer,1,NOT
i see a lot of people on this thread commenting about how the wage gap doesn't exist and that this is feminist propaganda but they fail to see that the extremist view of the feminist is that there is a wage gap out of malicious intent from males where in the real world the wage gap is a combination of unfortunate circumstances and averages between differing career choices while i believe we should challenge the extreme interpenetration of the wage gap i do believe it in fact exists and we should be doing more to understand it rather than shifting blame or denying it's existence.,1,NOT
there were two persons both 9 they had exactly the same job the same education the guy got an amount of money and when the girl asked about his job he mentioned how much he earned she got a little less so if you take how much he earns and make it dollar she earned like  cents so he got a little more money even though they had the same job same age and the same education.,1,NOT

well. that turned pretty quick as soon as a few astute folks did some  minute research into the 7 cents on the dollar argument and found it to be a fallacy in correlation it's now flipped to women make choices to work lower paying jobs in general than men. because society pressures them to do so. well from what i've seen the last ten years there are so many entities from advocacy organizations to notable individuals encouraging women to pursue higher paying jobs and work more like men do that even that argument is becoming ridiculous how about we allow folks to do what they want see them as individuals instead of lumping them into interest groups and see if our society starts acting rationally for once...,1,NOT

i think this video is well put for what it is i would like sources to back up the data in your video i also think that some of the reason the men care for their kids more is because it isn't possible for them most company's offer paid leave to women but none to men iirc thanks for reading thoughts?,1,NOT

it was much better when women could just get a job when they get out of school have a family retire to look after the kids they didn't have to worry about work because there was more money available to pay their husbands wage now we have these feminazis who want women to work their arse off to prove some psychological point that women can work as well whereas before they could relax have a nice quiet life now we have this wage gap myth that is splitting people apart whereas before it was you either had a good paying job or a minimum wage job.,3,NOT

wages=!earnings talking about a wage gap is incorrect if there truly were a wage gap then companies would hire more women to save the money from the wage gap what we have is an earnings gap yes men make more money but not because we get paid more for the same job and the same amount of work more men choose work over family time more women choose family time over work here in lies the difference there is nothing to fight for as there is nothing to fight against it is illegal for companies to discriminate based on gender.,1,NOT

everything cool until the explanation of why gap is bigger for business job seems a little made up in my opinion.,1,NOT
it's cause they weren't counting ethots,1,NOT
it does exist here as well i live in an oil producing arab country as an example a female english teacher would earn about 00 dollars per month a male arab teacher would earn about 90 per month both have the same college degree they say it is to encourage more men to become teachers men also get about  increase in their salaries for every child they have so if a guy has kids he would get a 5 increase in his salary the women however get nothing a man can apply for a government house if he is married but a woman cannot he gets about 800 dollars for getting married and they say it is to pay the dowry so if he marries wives which is still legal here than he would get 400 dollars and if he has kids from each wife he would be a millionaire i dont even want to calculate anymore.,1,NOT

bruh you ever heard of gender fluid?,2,NOT
the truth is that freelee is good at what she does and she's a good enough leader for the vegan movement there's always room for improvement in everything and everybody) being completely positive would be nice in a puppies sunshine world that we don't live in it would be good for her image but the truth is that controversy sparks people's interest and that's what freelee does she speaks up questions calls people out on their bullshit she does shit/ sitting back and making what i eat in a day videos is fine i love those videos too but veganism needs exposure most people aren't vegan not because they don't want to but because they're clueless as to what's really happening and freelee plays an important role in just that raising awareness and since the youtube community and the world in general if you ask me is fueled by drama and controversy that is exactly what she does and she's pretty good at it say what you will but she's authentic at the end of the day she does what has to be done and she's honest about it keep rocking.,1,NOT

it wasn't pre recorded because she made jokes and made a comment about how this video is not for vegans to watch she knew she was going to get backlash yet she didn't care and last why would she make that remark if it was pre-recorded.,1,NOT

okay so i am not trans however i am pan but from what i've seen so far the trans community doesn't claim her-,2,NOT
blaire mf white where r u at,2,NOT
trishhhhh noooo why didn't you educate yourself on what it actually means to be transgender before you recorded this i sense you're trying to vocalize feelings n maybe lean toward gender fluid which is great and you should explore this and be open and pride about it hell yes but you're totally misunderstanding and misconstruing being trans and def saying some things that are pretty wildly offensive even if you didn't intend it to be yeeeeeesh educate yourself first bc you gotta at the very least understand the terms before you claim to identify i support you exploring your gender identity and sexuality but please please please invest some time in educating yourself first! you're gonna ostracize yourself and others in the community with hastily labeling yourself without understanding xx,2,NOT
what...what are you going through?,2,NOT
honey you are confused.,3,NOT

i don't like how people are mean she is obviously a bit confused she or he is having a gender crisis she has my support.,1,NOT
i'm probably going to get lots of hate for this but i relate a lot to this video i am very feminine to most people but i relate a lot to males i feel very masculine in some ways and very feminine in others some days i want to be a male and i feel so lost other days i want to be hyper feminine it's very confusing to others and also myself and its so hard,1,NOT
i had seizure just listening to her,3,NOT
it sucks that people can't just let her do what she wants and not complain and fucking cry about everything.,3,NOT

wow this was just a hot mess she needs to seek help,3,NOT
im ashamed i gave a click to this shit,3,NOT
this doesn't add up.. wheres the dysphoria... does she not realise how its works in general like the transition part,2,NOT
"trish i think your view on who you think you might be is based on society's opinions the reasons you think you might be a male are based on straight masculine men's opinion on you as a girl that's the type you attract and as for you being attracted to gay men it could be an emotional thing you enjoy having sex with anyone not matter their orientation but you might feel like you identify with a gay man because that's who you are attracted too if you want a feminine boyfriend they do exist but the majority of men who are attracted to you seem to be masculine men so you feel thats what you're stuck with"" and as for being penis envy i am too girl i think most women can agree that if they had a penis they would be happier because being a cis male is easy and accepted they can be dominant and assertive and be considered manly and thats normal and bonus points if you're a white cis man because they get everything handed to them being drag looks fun and exciting and they play dress up and you're right they don't always wear a face full of make up but it's their thing that they like to get all glam that doesn't necessarily mean you identify with them you just have the same hobbies i am woman love to put on cute pastel dresses mostly cuz i hate pants lol and wear make up but half the times i don't feel like taking the extra time to do all that.",2,NOT
i haven't watched a video of hers in years and i am not trying to make fun of her looks but to me she looks seriously ill seriously like she is on some insane drugs very sad.,5,ABU
oh no...this just ain't it you shouldn't of even posted anything until you fully understood yourself and maybe talked to someone to clarify how and what you feel what you're saying does not match up to the i'm transgender there are many other genders i think you maybe classify more as gender fluid you said you don't want to be offensive but you basically making everyone who hates on trans n others believe they are all like this you could of went about this so much better hun.,2,NOT
loving trish's new blinged out nails üèæüíÖ i wonder if trish will get dragged for this there's ppl that are actually transgendered lol this just seems like a scream for attention trish is a female that sometimes doesn't like to glam each day no need for the extra stupid labels trish always looks for something random to bring up lol smh,3,NOT
i think i lost some brain cells watching this,3,NOT
werent u a baby two seconds ago,2,NOT
what did jason do to you?!,2,NOT
sorry girl.. you liking to be around guys more than girls you feeling like you can relate to a guy you feeling like you would like to see what its like to have a penis none of this means you are transgender it means you like attention you dont have women friends because youre jealous and catty and dont allow yourself to see past a womans threat to you to get to know them or have a real friendship with them and your just in need of internet content to pay the bills.,2,NOT
so i'm not hating i've been watching t since i could remember but i really do not understand this i have multiple friends that are trans they want to be fully the gender they feel as they are they will go to any length to be a guy or girl whoever they are t has went through so many surgeries to get bigger breasts or an ass or a flatter stomach it's all to give a girlish appearance i've never had a friend who had purposely made themselves look at opposite gender especially having money they had always tried to achieve to make themselves feel they when they do on the inside out.,3,NOT
only came here for the commentsüëÄ,2,NOT
"""i don't know if i would say i'm confused i would say that i'm all of it lol what?",2,NOT
you literally just made a video about being a women and having to wear a bra a week ago,2,NOT

i finally get to use this line.. trisha you dumb attention seeking slut just stop you sound like an airhead and look like 0 of you is plastic,6,ABU
says i'm a guy proudly shows off tits to get more views in different videos,2,NOT
don't take our community for your own fame we're worth more than that.,1,NOT
you're a fucking idiot this is incredibly offensive to transgender people delete this you literal dumpster fire.,7,ABU
trisha talks nonsense to the camera the way people talk to their best friend behind closed doors i respect that.,1,NOT
i shaved my head and i don't wear makeup so what now am i a boy,2,NOT
not a gay manüòÇ,2,NOT
as a trans person i find this disrespectful tbh,2,NOT
its so sad to read these comments because i can understand everything you said i as well am a girl who feels like i should of been a boy except i like girls as well and feminine boys i dont like really masculine men and i really hate being dominated by a guy ive had sex a few times with masculine men and i have to say i hate it everything you are saying is so relatable for me and im so glad you made this video dont listen to anyone in the comments opinions they will never understand.,1,NOT
as a nb teen this video makes me so uncomfortable you invalidate people in this state that being trans is a choice and overall are just digging yourself into a hole educate yourself on this shit before you try and claim to be transgender when you're not and have it all wrong.,2,NOT
"trisha...there's a such difference as identifying with and identifying as""",2,NOT
what you described is not being transgender it sounds like you're describing body dysmorphia.,2,NOT
the way she explains how she's feeling it sounds like she non binary trans gender means you change fully not just don't wear makeup,2,NOT
4:1 as a girl i've never related to masculinity sis,2,NOT
no trisha you aren't trans you just don't like gender stereotypes it's either that or you're doing this for attention which either way is fucked up also how can you be a bisexual woman and a gay man????,2,NOT
gay guy does something common in the gay community trisha oh my god me!,2,NOT
bro have u seen a psychologist im worried,3,NOT
it's more like transsexual....,5,ABU
so you're...a gay man...and a bisexual woman...and an ally...and a drag queen...sis you ever heard of genderqueer genderfluid?,2,NOT
can we get most disliked vid on yt pls,3,NOT
she's oops sorry he's literally full of shit,5,ABU
wow this is really what it's come to huh,3,NOT
aight i don't agree with trish on this at all and this is because of my question y'all are tryna cancel trisha saying she's ftm but acts feminine but y'all are fine w people that are ftm who wear makeup nail varnish and wear dresses being ftm and acting feminine will make you dysphoric that is a true sign a person is transgender but y'all get upset with people who think someone transgender is their biological sex when they act like their biological sex yes stereotypes are shitty but you have to follow by the stereotypical type of that gender to pass i have spoken to many transgender people and they agree you can't come for trish when you literally praise people for doing the same thing she's doing you praise people that act like the gender they were born and dress like that stereotype of the gender yet you get upset at someone who's doing literally that people may agree of disagree with me but keep this in mind.,2,NOT
as a trans guy this video is more than incredibly offensive this is worse for the lgbt community than actual hate videos as her target audience will be roped into believing this bullshit the fact that she said you can choose what gender you are really made me feel an anger i hadn't felt if i had the choice i wouldn't be trans.. i don't think she realises how hard this journey is.,3,NOT
trisha love and praise goes to you honey,1,NOT
theres a word and a term for not being male or female only its genderfluid oh my god t wtf.,3,NOT
trish so do i think i'm transgender 000% also trish but do i also identify with my natural born gender 000%‚Äù,2,NOT
i identify as a robot or at least a cyborg.,2,NOT
not only is this transphobic but this is just offensive in general as a trans man i think what you're describing is body dysmorphia not dysphoria.,2,NOT
no fuck this and fuck you if only you knew for a second what it was like,5,ABU
ok one thing straight you are not trans....if you are trans or feel trans you don't have glam nails you don't wear female clothes look her profile pics-... but she agrees that she is the 000 the gender she was assigned at birth.. it doesn't have logic,2,NOT

basically what i'm hearing is that she was happy because she didn't have to try to look nice because she acted like a dude once so now she's trans,2,NOT
in the next video she'll confess she is in love with cedric.. i love you trish but.. i think you are just confused.,2,NOT

sounds like you may be genderfluid....,2,NOT
jesus you really explained it very well and justified yourself where's all the hate coming from,1,NOT
i think this is the first video i've ever disliked....,2,NOT
here's a tip coming from a ftm trans man stop stereotyping men and women saying that even if you acted slightly more masculine that makes you trans or a man and the reason you like gay men is most probably a fetish cause i know a lot of cis women who find gay men attractive and it is normal to wonder what it would be like to be the other gender but because you question that doesn't mean you are trans so yeah stop before all the angry lgbt members come and attack you.,2,NOT
bruh this is bull im just confused,3,NOT
back on drugs 00%,5,ABU
still love u tho,1,NOT
in other words....she is just a whore since she has been with anything with legs!,5,ABU
i understand the backlash from this video i understand how misinformed most of this video is but as a member of the lgbt community i think this is an amazing opportunity to educate and correct her on what she thinks is being transgender i think that unfortunately many people share a lot of the same views that trish does in this video i don't know her motives for making this video or how her views became so inaccurate but the way that we as a community react to moments like these‚Äîwith backlash and hate or education and unity‚Äîwill shape the way the world views our community we need to find more ways to unite and educate rather than bash and cancel just my two cents.,1,NOT
so.. you're gender fluid.. just say that and move on,2,NOT
ok i don't even know what i'm supposed to think anymore i give off a very masculine and dude vibe hell i wear men's cologne because i like smelling like a man and i don't know who i'm attracted to i don't care abt what pronouns i use the only thing i set in stone identify as is asexual that's it thank you for listening to me ted talk,1,NOT

if we go by your standards i guess i'm trans.,2,NOT
i have always wanted to have been born a guy when i was younger i even dressed as i thought boys would dress in the hopes that i would be recognized as a guy before i knew what trans was) but i am not trans i know that i do not have gender disphoria which though it's highly debated it's what kinda cements what makes someone trans just because you envy males or have a fetish for gay men does not mean that you are trans.,1,NOT

dont know you i have never watched you before but yall need to calm down people go through a processes it took my transgender daughter  years to finally commit and know who she was for sure the difference is that trisha is doing it on social media in front of the world it's like when peopel who were bi had to be harassed by gays and lesbians for just being gay and not wanting to admit it sexuality and gender are spectrums and we all shift along that spectrum even when we finally know who we are trisha if your using the community step off if your finding your place and identity stand tall!,1,NOT

there are a few good points in here but with the amount of bs and lack of research they are overlooked i implore ya t to do some research on gender fluid also never relate someone who is lgbtq to someone with a disability that's all i got. for now.,2,NOT
i really thinks she's having a mental breakdown nothing new,3,NOT
just because trisha has a massive following doesn't make anything she says about herself is invalid or done as some form of stunt for clout‚Äù if she had only followers she would be treated like any other transgender because there's alot that goes into an identity and just because one person has a completely different trans experience than you doesn't make your trans-ness invalid a community is open to all. not for those who fit within this specific frame or category of what they think transgenders should be. if she identifies as a male then she identifies as male you can say your opinions to her but to now call her out of her name even after she told you her truth is so messed up and ignorant.,2,NOT

trisha i don't like being harassed my straight guys is this being transgender?,3,NOT
ahaha people are focusing on one certain thing from the video and acting like it's the only reason she gave and i bet they didn't even watch the whole thing,1,NOT
so she's jealous of male gender norms like not being expected to wear make up or being assertive lol,2,NOT
if your born a female but look like a boy you are a female unless you actually get trans,2,NOT
as a trans man who's on hrt i'd just like to say.. there is no one in the comments or anyone who is allowed to tell anyone how much they're allowed to conform whether they have to be on hrt or have to have surgery you don't need to have dysphoria to be trans you can literally use what pronouns make you most comfortable i think we should leave it at that.,1,NOT
this is fuckinf horrible and her posting this video is horrible she is ridiculous,5,ABU
one question do you experience gender dysphoria if not you literally cannot be trans without it as that's what tells your brain that you're not in the right body,2,NOT
transgender denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex tomboy is a girl who exhibits characteristics or behaviors considered typical of a boy including wearing masculine clothing and engaging in games and activities that are physical in nature and are considered in many cultures to be unfeminine or the domain of boys,1,NOT
so she's attracted to cedric and feels the need to make a video to justify that?,2,NOT
i've seen this bitch floating around youtube on her massive inflatable tits for years and i've never understood how someone so ugly both inside and out has a following speaking directly to her you are the epitome of the dumb blonde stereotype and i can't imagine anyone wanting to be your friend associate with you let alone attend your funeral when you finally grace us by leaving this planet.,6,ABU

so.. she's a tomboy.. ,2,NOT
this world will never be vegan but enjoy your life in a cult.,3,NOT
what a banger!!!,1,NOT
it's okay to be confused i confused body dysmorphia for gender dysphoria and i was under the transgender label for two years i was lost and didn't have answers to my questions i am now happy and going by she/her born gender it's okay to be confused and try to find yourself what's not okay is saying you are trans when you are 000 comfortable with being the born gender you are it's okay if you want to be t and you want to be more masculine however i dont think this is the right label now when you are finding yourself it's okay to go through things and see what fits and what doesn't but i would suggest making that a personal journey off camera and coming back when you find yourself the trans community and the lgbt community in general get a lot of hate because people throw labels they know nothing about on themselves as a trend trans people are no longer valid in societies eyes because of transtrenders not saying what you are going through is a trend but it's something that takes more time and shouldn't be determined by the fact that you like gay men and you feel like you would be more respected if you had a penis it's true you may not be just a cis women and i hope that you are able to find and love yourself because that's all anyone deserves i don't think you should be hated but i don't think you should jump into this label either because it will only cause backlash for you and the trans community with that said i hope you do well and find who you really are in the end you are the one who knows yourself best,2,NOT
the fact you made 800 dollars from the video is disgusting you should give that money to the community you are basically taking the piss out of you are a disgrace,3,NOT
people have liked her even before this?? lmao ight,3,NOT
i never comment on youtube videos but this is too much i have been out as a trans guy for whole years and i almost killed myself because of the people around me and how they were treating me they have gotten better because they understood and years later some people still don't i work for respect everyday and this could take some of that progress away you're not a guy please stop.,2,NOT
as someone actually part of the lgbt community a gay man) all i can say is shame this is not us we do not own this don't think that all of us are like this cuz that's not true at all she's just a tom boy and everyone knows it ,2,NOT
this video is confusing to say the least but what she says makes some sense if we look at this from a crossdreamer perspective a lot of trans people live and present as their assigned gender even if their real identity is trans or nonbinary there are good and bad reasons for why they do so but the fact that they are not transitioning does not make them less trans her frustration of being a gay man in a woman's body reflects the kind of pain many non-transitioning trans people feel i guess some will dismiss the whole idea as preposterous given her extreme femme appearance but many trans people make desperate attempts at living up to the stereotypes trying to fit in kirsten beck was a bearded navy seal fighting in afghanistan before she gave up fighting herself moreover characteristics like femme and butch are not restricted to one gender after all these were terms created in the lesbian community i don't know if trisha is trans but she deserves the chance to find out for herself.,1,NOT
is this a joke trish i haven't been watching you for a while i'm sorry but is this a prank or something somebody tell me edit  i just read the comments and.. um.. i am a lesbian and this is horrible trisha i watched you for a while now and you were my getaway and i just wow...,3,NOT

soon many farms will run out of the water and soil quality necessary to grow vegan food the pesticides may also kill off all the bugs necessary to pollinate crops ruminant animals don't need fertilizer pesticide or irrigation they are quite happy on land where crops cannot be grown vegans can't even digest the food they eat bacteria must digest it for them then most of the fats the bacteria create are excreted instead of absorbed because the bacteria are in the colon it's difficult to regard a diet that requires supplementation with respect.,3,NOT

i'd like to thank the vegan activists educators media producers scientists doctors farm abuse activists inventive cooks and vegan product producers i used to be one of those ignorant fools who thought you can't get enough protein/nutrients seeing fat or malnourished vegans and thought the point was proven they were just not doing it right) i ate abused/diseased meat without thinking of the savagery that farm animals face the internet and the free flow of information is the greatest gift to humanity it has enabled me to start making the switch and it's been pretty effortless i don't feel any different really as i've always had a pretty healthy diet but i do know that plant protein sources have much more nutrients than meat which only really provides proteins/b vitamins however it's comforting to know that my diet isn't destroying our home planet earth what makes me feel great is knowing i'm not a part of the torture of farm animals i am no longer a part of a reason of their 4/ agony screams torture living completely hopeless lives of extreme suffering humans are the masters of the earth we should not be such disgraceful creatures and treat our home as if we're monkeys flinging our feces everywhere we should respect ourselves by respecting our home and be honorable responsible stewards of planet earth.,3,NOT

i'm all for eating more plants but i don't think we should force people to stop eating meat if we are worried about methane check out taronis technologies they have the solutions to all of the climate arguments and they are talking to the governments around the world including our own we don't need extreme ideas just need to use our brains and create technology we need more co to make plants grow faster and bigger with our population increasing i don't think reducing the co is the answer but i would agree that we need to find cleaner ways to use the fuels we have taronis technology even adds oxygen to the atmosphere and i'm not sure that electric cars are going to make our world cleaner when the majority of our electricity comes from coal gas and petroleum we need clean technologies i do think that educating people on plant based diets is a good thing most will see the benefits if they are willing to try it.,2,NOT

if you do your research you'll find that the government passed a bill that states that no woman can be paid less than a man working the same job and the same position working the same hours so next time you make a video discriminating against men do some research,2,NOT
vox you need to know there is no pay gap,2,NOT
how do we fix the gender wage gap does a mind-shift happen at home where men share the household work equally with women or is there some policies or change at work that can reduce the gender wage gap?,1,NOT
why do the vast majority of people who claim that the wage gap doesn't exist never show any evidence to back up their claims?,2,NOT
what they're saying isn't necessarily wrong just for the wrong reasons the pharmacy example is incredibly incredibly flawed and the flexible hours reasoning is as well.,1,NOT
as far as i know don't women earn more than men in part time jobs as well as in the age gap between 6-25 although only very slightly statistics like the .7 or .7 cent per dollar wage are very misleading as it doesn't take into account stuff like stereotypes social norms segregation in the labour market and the other general differences between women and men.,2,NOT
get our lord and savior milo in here to teach everyone about the wage gap,3,NOT
2:2 cause biologically that's what women are geared towards doing there's a reason why guys don't make milk imma just point that out to you sjws out there..,3,NOT
oh my god wages and earnings are different you keep comparing earnings and calling it wage difference they are two different things women earn less due to their job choice/vacation time/raising kids/maternity leave by working less hours if they didn't they would earn the same amount maybe go back  years and look at the equal pay act of 96 where you already achieved your goal it's like beating in a dead horse jesus christ.,3,NOT
wait this liberal video just debunked itself there is a wage gap because women choose less hours? it literally said that lmaooo.,3,NOT
well then its up to personal responsibility inb culture makes them less consistant in the work force talk to your man.,3,NOT
also the more men helping in households and with parenting becomes normal the less of a gender issue this will be i think this is not about giving rights to women i think this is giving rights to women and men that's why it's so important for men to support feminism.,2,NOT
now try to get explain this to a feminazi,3,NOT
my mum is a boss she earn more than my dad who is also a boss lol,2,NOT
"so this video says that the wage gap doesn't come down to gender but what a woman can achieve versus what a man can achieve a woman has to take care of children and has more duties outside of her job so she cannot be as reliable on her job as a man thus she cannot be as good as her job as a man and that is for every job that requires flexible hours like business careers thus she gets paid as much as a man given her achievements this is very interesting that being said why is the conclusion we need jobs to be more flexible for women and not we need to balance housework between men and women"" how is it normal for a woman to have more duties outside of her work than a man don't both parents have as much responsibility towards their own children towards their own house?",2,NOT
the wage gap isn't real.,2,NOT
i like how women consistently report being more happy with their lives then men which is reflected in the suicide statistics yet there is this effort to get women to run their lives more like men.,2,NOT
wheres all female plumbers oh...they took a lower paying job like becoming a teacher instead wha wha,2,NOT
good job vox,1,NOT
so there is no wage gap....,2,NOT
"what's stupid about this video is that it only analyzes upper class jobs business sector jobs with 400,00 salaries are not at all representative of the wage gap the wage gap exists because working class and middle class jobs of particularly male predominate labor have traditionally been unionized steel workers plumbers electricians factory operators traditionally female jobs have not and they're almost all in the service sector i'm sure there are some social sexist reasons for that ironically as traditional masculine jobs are being outsourced abroad both men and women are today left with low paying jobs without a history of unionization that's a big reason why wages have been so stagnant for  years i don't write the news folks i just report it.",2,NOT
pharmacy is a more female oriented profession and the hospital i work at for example all managerial positions within the pharmacy department is filled with women not only that but even the higher positions in the pharmacy are still female dominated.,1,NOT
because the jobs mens do engineer doctors scientist,3,NOT
in my demographic urban age 0-30 women make more than men anyone want to talk about that wage gap?,2,NOT
even a broken clock is right twice a day,2,NOT
before you watch the video the wage gap doesn't exist,3,NOT
i don't care that women make less then men men have better jobs that's why they make more and now women make more this video sucks it's all false and men should be making more because they try harder while women just cheat on the man that's why they make so much i really don't care about your stupid little oh we need money ehh no you don't y'all make less cause you don't have as good jobs idiot this was a horrible video,5,ABU
or i would just stop hiring women.,2,NOT
race plays an important part as well.,1,NOT
"every job i have had men and women got paid the same wage and yet i can create a wage gap very simply within that job example my wife and i work in the same job doing the same hours and getting the same hourly wage we both start the job at  years old and work until we retire we don't have kids and both take the same days off but my wife earns less than me how retirement age men are forced to work for years more than women in the uk even though women live longer so even if i we get the exact same wage it results in a pay gap the gap being the years wages the man earns extra because he cant claim a pension at the same age on top of that paying a woman less than a man for the same job is against the law so if the pay gap was this big then most women would be taking the employer to court and winning which is very easy to do if this is the case focusing on the pay gap in this way is useless and it does not actually look at problems with wages for both men and women paying the top person in a museum 350,00 a year when the rest of the staff are volunteers is wrong political staff being given 35 for travel an food each day when they only live  miles away is wrong zero hours contracts so that people can be screwed over by the company they work for is wrong both men and women are getting screwed over with regards to wage issues and focusing on a wage gap which is already abolished by law is the least of the problems",2,NOT
woman work different jobs and don't work the same hours as men that's it.,3,NOT
women doing different jobs to men difference in pay okay women and men doing the same job difference in pay not okay,1,NOT
its also maybe the fact the pharmasutrics are a heavy female led perfession,1,NOT
vox is such a joke there is no wage gap‚Äù.,3,NOT
to sum it up video states that the wage gap isn't because of discrimination but because of what choices women have jobs worktime etc doesn't state that there is a pay gap i conclude that there isn't a discrimination of women but that the fault is in women as they can make more they just generally choose less paying jobs work less not everything is their fault as you can account that women have kids so that influences their earnings),1,NOT
keep bringing in the thumbs down ladies reality is tough.,3,NOT
what about the fact that it ain't true,3,NOT
"400,00 a year i'm going to business school",1,NOT
there is no wage gap it doesn't exist it's a earnings gap which people choose through their job.,3,NOT
i think women that are married and have children should be prepared to loose out on some money maybe stop being so selfish for a moment and think about the bigger picture you're a family the child needs a mother especially in the early years to take care and nurture said child if you don't want kids and want to pursue your career go ahead then you will earn as much as your male colleagues,5,ABU

cmon vox you're on the right track(ish but what a terrible summary basically wage gap isn't as black and white as people think it is it's more that society is still aimed at women being primary caregivers and men being breadwinners so the opportunities they have are different it's not a case of paying equal wage for same job/hours because that's not the issue the solution is to start having better procedures in place for maternity leave less discrimination against females around the age they have kids more men taking paternity leave etc you kinda touched on it a bit but i feel like you spent too much time going in-depth into the studies instead of talking about the theory of it which is a pretty big part of the research itself),2,NOT
"you do not want to close the wage gap the reason you have it is because you are using an average in the calculation which is not something you should ever do with a trinomial distribution the average is based on the whole male and female population and does not take into account that you have three distinct different groups low income earners"" medium income earners and high income earners"" and you have a difference between the male and female demographics in these three groups this is what causes the wage gap for example just to illustrate this) say that the low income is 40k aud the average wage in oz is 80k aud a year an high income is 160k a year we set that to be exactly the same for both men and women then we place 0 of women in low pay jobs 0 or women in medium paid jobs and 0 in high pay jobs for men we set 0 in low pay jobs 0 in medium paid jobs and 0 in high paid jobs now we calculate the average women . 0k . 0k . 60k 80,00 a year men . 0k . 0k . 60k 96,00 a year wage gap 80,00 6,00 .83333... difference . 0.8333 .16666.. so the wage gape is about 7 in this example note here that the wages are identical for all men and women the only thing that differs is the number of males and females in each group so if you want to close this wage gap you can do that in ways  all people get the same wage irrespective of job this is communism and state controlled wage-setting  we demand the same number of men and women in all jobs in society this is again state control over who get to work where and again communism we have over 0 years of data based on communism it doesn't work and leads to tyranny this is why we don't want to close the wage gap because the way to do it tyrannical.",3,NOT

i liked the explanation but think she should have included why the wage gap in the tech field is almost non existent as she said it has a lot to do with hours of availability and with many jobs in the tech field having the option to wfh at least part of the time it saves trips into the office i found wfh is great as long as you make sure to get out and do something during the day as well it doesn't really matter what just as long as one makes sure to leave home for a while otherwise motivation burnout begins to set in.,1,NOT
you think this is a godd explanation but there is alot of info you leave oute that idont know  when you say men get and wimmen get .79 but you need more info than that .edjucation like you state  is this per houer or at the end of the year then if men work 0 houers in a set time and wimmen work  houers i that same set time is this gap not fair  now i dont know the stats but the fair way of paying someone is not by the houer but by the work so if men does more work in less time but work the same time as wimmen it is only logical that men gets more if they get more work done same if wimmen does more wokr is the same time that men do then wimmen must get more i wil only cal it equalety when someone can say that wimmen and men get the same kind of money for moving this bag of stuf from point a to point b no matter the time it takes you get a set amount of money when the work is done this is fair and until someone can say that men get more for the same job that took the same amount of time if they then get more then the system is not fair then it is fair to pay the guy more if he does it faster depending on the job cus sometimes if you does something a litle slower take your workd and deliver it to someone that then have to do work on it the slower eatch point in the cahain is the slower the total work is done.,2,NOT

ok sure mabye the wage gap has more to do with personal choice but if we look at the highest paying majors in elite schools / of them have a leading male public and when u see the least paying majors / have a female public the statement this research makes is that biology makes women more into emotional stuff like social work and psicology while men are more interested in mechanical work so when we look at this in terms of career choices of course men pick the higher paying career paths not necessarily because of the money but its what they like and what they're good at and what is really being siad here is that the reason why mechanical work is higher paying than social work is because we value mens work a lot more than we do women's.,2,NOT

i want to know if the overall estimate is based on harder working jobs and higher up jobs,2,NOT
men make more money than women on average but that's only because the very top successful men have enough money to cover up the unsuccessful men the overwhelming majority of the homeless population are men the overwhelming majority of plumbers landscapers garbage truck drivers mailmen and construction workers low paying jobs are almost all male dominated women actually occupy most of the median jobs in society and yes a big reason for the wage gap is that men ask for raises more than women but if you look at the statistics men are significantly fired more than women because they take those risks additionaly there is biology to consider successful men will almost always have options to female partners while unsuccessful men will have much less females do not need to be successful or accomplished to be desired by men so there is less of a demand for it just because the numbers arent the same doesnt mean there is a great injustice being perpetuated by a grand evil superpower think with your brain not your heart.,2,NOT
actually it's all women and all men including those that don't work it also doesn't factor in anything from maternal leave to hours worked to length of career the study is just a statistic of what every woman in the us earns averaged out vs what ever man in the us earns averaged out including those that make billions and those that don't earn a nickle factoring those in tends to result in a lot of fields where women are payed vastly more than men per-hour.,2,NOT

 this message is really long and i hope the creators of this video will take out some minutes from their time to read it i genuinely think these are valid arguments and i promise this is not hate thank you and sorry(for the long comment well i guess it's time to trap you in your own statistics vox as you mentioned about the job of a pharmacist you should that women earned 2 of what men did where is the other % as you mentioned that now there are more flexible hours and she can work on hours suitable so the variable of a kid is gone whether a woman has a kid or not so in theory according to you the wage gap should not exist between pharmacists but it does so what could possibly be the reason of the missing % another thing in the statistics you showed about different types of jobs tech business and one other it is true that tech has a shrinked up wage gap but i most certainly saw some green dots on the middle range too if a woman is doing her job completing experiments and whatever else is done on labs then why are there some positions in the tech itself that have an existing wage gap now going on to the study of mba students the one between 99 and 006) now this time most variables are same the women have the exact same qualifications as the men and is most cases even the same age as men so now tell me even after that why are woman paid 500 less than men yes the wage gap is considerably less in this scenario and that is really great but why is there a difference at all this all is regardless whether a woman has a kid or not or even married after all you showed us the statistics of difference of wage gap between woman who have kids and woman who do not agreed that there was a considerable difference but then again the column of women who do not have kids was not zero why not this time there is clear indication that having kids is not the prime reason of women being paid less than men so my final question is if this is clearly not the prime reason then what is?,2,NOT

well also that women are more expensive to keep at a workplace than men,3,NOT
many women choose to have children some don't exactly choose ofc depending on the situation but its seems very clear that the wage gap is a natural occurance due to the differences between men and women equality of opportunity does not always equal a mean equality of outcome that's not a nessisarily a bad thing men and women are different and that's the end of it be proud of your gender and strive to do well.,2,NOT

why does it seem there aren't enough females in ceo positions etc let me explain simply in the work place if you want to get to the highest position possible you have to make sacrifices you cannot have everything your way it's impossible you have to begin to work extremely long hours to get to the top which means you sacrifice your free time family time etc males are more willing to do this than females in general males don't have it all so why do feminists think they can males have to sacrifice their family time and free time etc because they may be travelling around the world a lot as part of their job women are natural caregivers and most females in general want to start a family because they have a limited of time to have babies women typically want more balance in their life they don't want to be juggling a high profile job family life and other responsibilities think about it that's alot of work for one person especially considering how much work you need to put in if you have to raise a family it isn't easy for females because they're natural caregivers and they typically tend to be more involved with family anyway for example looking after the children taking them to school etc feeding them etc hence why women take on more part time roles and hence why the gender wage gap statistics are misleading if you work part time you earn less than a full time worker fact women were actually happier in the 950's because they didn't have the responsibilities of having to work high profile jobs look after the home look after the kids like more women may be experiencing today furthermore another reason that explains why there aren't more women in high profile positions is because of competitiveness and personality females are competing not only with females but males too males are naturally and evolutionary more competitive due to their natural dominant traits) so having to compete with other females and other males isn't exactly easy females typically have an agreeable personality unlike males in general) what this means is females are less likely to disagree with something and be vocal about it in general) if females want to succeed in these types of environments and get promoted/earn more money they must take on these male traits competitiveness and dominance women must sacrifice a portion of their femininity in order to gain equality of outcome just like men would have to sacrifice their masculinity otherwise known as toxic masculinity to feminist sjws in order to create equality of outcome desired by feminists) feminists don't understand that having both a mother and father in a high profile job that requires lots of working hours requires time away from their kids who's lives are gonna get affected the kids they are missing out on family time and it's going to affect how they are raised because their parents may be too busy working to give them attention and the care thus potentially resulting in the children to grow up unnaturally independent and not unattached to their parents distant) to conclude i'm generalising here so don't comment saying i can manage because you're a minority which i acknowledge hence why i said in general.,5,ABU

where i come from we don't have this problem cause our society is built on families rather than on individuals you live with your parents and contribute in the house money but still everyone has his own money and own property you leave your parents house when you are ready to start your own family and both partners contribute in the house money and it is the same for men and women,1,NOT

jesus these comments are a mess the video is implying that the primary solution lies in incentivizing businesses to give more flexible working hours which is something that can narrow the earnings gap and potentially be better for everyone you don't have to be a diehard feminist to see the logic here in the standard household where women work but also take on a bit more responsibility for childcare the option of say a - shift for mothers means that they can better align their working schedule with childcare it also gives more flexibility to work ot.,1,NOT
if companies can get away with paying women less then why don't they fire all men and hire only women up to 0% of a companys expense are salaries.,2,NOT
accurate until about the  second mark.. a new record...,2,NOT
notice how the gap in pay jumped up in the 0s...something big must of happened then whispers equal pay act of 963) also people need to note that jobs do not have equal amount of men or women..meaning there's mostly men in the tech field there's mostly women in nursing there's mostly men on oil rigs or there's mostly women social workers with each field paying differently there should of been a comparison of same jobs from the same companies as different companies do pay different salaries for different jobs when the initial survey or study was done.,2,NOT

vox loves to put out liberal propaganda the market is efficiently regulating wages as necessary further even if it wasn't that implies a great opportunity to fix it via the free-market as an employer would take advantage of lower waged women who as suggested produce equal output) government intervention is not necessary in addition to this i'm extremely skeptical of anything a liberal says after all at first it was just the 7 per dollar claim liberalism is a pack of lies starting with the misuse of the term liberal.',2,NOT

if you are a woman how is the wage gap affecting you if the issue is that women do more unpaid work like taking care of their children because they want to then how does that affect you as an individual if a wife and husband decide that the husband is going to do the unpaid housework and childcare from now on the woman will be earning more than him tl;dr the woman prefers to do the housework the gap wont affect her if she solves the housework problem with her partner.,3,NOT
this is my opinion if you want the wage gap to disappear then work harder for it work for longer take more shifts men on average work harder and longer for more times during the week that's why men gain more money thank you for not freaking out about it like it ruined your life and instead kept your cool.,3,NOT

"if a woman doesn't like the idea of taking the time and energy and making the sacrifices to raise her own kids why have them if it happens anyway there are so many couples would happily take and raise them that there is no problem there but if she has bought into the idea that she must have it all or else she must resent all men and if making as much or more money as her husband is more important then pay someone else to raise them or me and i mention the husband because the video does) daycare workers will never love or treat those children like their own and they come and go so the sense of abandonment starts young and telling them they shouldn't feel it is about the adults feelings not theirs ever heard the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world"" in case you need that spelled out it means that the person who spends the most time with and talking to/guiding children is the one who actually raises them not the one who simply houses them pays the bills eats dinner with them if even that and gives the biggest gifts) he or she develops the closest relationship and passes on their values and beliefs and thus naturally has the greatest influence on what the kids will do with their lives thus that person becomes the hand. i'm old enough to have seen many many outcomes of both ways and there's no going back or do-overs, and no amount of sorry's change things) so we made the choice to be the ones to love and raise ours and i'd be that hand who was there knowing the financial challenges and i am so glad we did it was worth every struggle and that's what i tell them you are worth more than any amount of money i could have made. yes kids raised by others usually still love their parents but when talking with them many wistfully and with repressed guilt say they wish they could have had something like what we did for ours but that they'd never tell their mom because it would just make her feel bad so they carry the painful burden quietly kids have enough pain in this world so why add to it if it's for a point of pride for the philosophy a choice to be financially richer and have more stuff at their expense my boss and co-workers would not remember me long after i am gone would not likely be there for me when i am old and feeble and need help or visit me regularly if i am in hospital send cards call or text or put flowers on my grave i'd never imagine being a stereotypical passive-aggressive guilt mom who overtly or subtly makes them feel bad for holding me back and being the reason i couldn't achieve my feminist dream. whoa nice thing to pass onto your kids eh oh and if this guilt-trips you at least you are an adult and can handle it better than a child.",3,NOT

this is actually a pretty fair treatment of the gender wage gap the disparity certainly does exist but its cause is rooted primarily in the different life decisions men and women make namely child care as this video suggests not misogyny which is what many mainstream feminists would have us believe.,2,NOT

that the wage gap doesn't exist,2,NOT
"i listened to this with an open mind hoping to learn something new about the so-called pay gap that i may have in fact been missing i had been under the impression that the gap is a myth but was looking to hear other explanations as to why it persists all i learned from watching this video is that its creators seem to take issue with the fact that women have choices and that they choose different paths in life that men do not and in some cases cannot) this is why i can't support modern feminism as it is most often expressed in the mainstream it's a bunch of women shaming men for being men and shaming women for daring not to devote themselves to the corporate rat race and instead choosing to focus on their homes and families feminists have created deep confusion and unhappiness in several generations of men and women but especially women who i am finding feel increasingly pressured to achieve while at the same time being keenly aware that their youth and fertility are slipping away those that do have children feel guilty and ashamed for being away from their children in order to work while simultaneously feeling resentment that they are spending the bulk of their time caring for another human being and staying at home with each passing day i grow more and more disillusioned with feminism because i see the misery and internal conflict it is causing constantly i've come to the conclusion that feminists only care about themselves they care about being seen to fight for a cause"" they care about proselytizing and spreading their feminist faith to the masses but they do not care about women.",3,NOT

god damn it i can't believe my history teacher in high school fooled me into believing this if it simply compares median incomes then it's a joke of a comparison women need to realize that men are still slightly better than them overall and worry about their individual selves women were never meant to outclass men their primary focus should be to develop the skills and habits that they can pass onto their children to offset their lower income.,5,ABU

the  cents to a dollar stat is only true if you compare apples to oranges overall if more librarians are women and more men are firefighters that means a man on average will earn more because firefighters tend to earn more but if you compare the wages of men who are firefighters to women who are also firefighters or any other profession) the wage gap turns out to be a lot less than  cents to a dollar so it is false to claim women earn  cents to a dollar doing the same work as a man*. politifact has rated such statements by politicians as false i really wish this video had made this point clearer.,2,NOT

oversimplified pharmacist is a bad example because they tend to all do the exact same thing so it's easy to justify earning what your peer's earn meanwhile a scientist or business person's position could take on a whole range of possible responsibilities and niches some with more earning potential than others so if the pharmacists wage gap is 2 then there's your argument proving there is a wage gap.,1,NOT

well the whole gender pay gap is fake it has been debunked so many times!,3,NOT

maybe woman will stop complaining and do work then they will get paid equally easy problem solved,3,NOT
there is not a gender wage gap it is a federal crime to discriminate against people based on their sex there is a gender earnings gap which closes to almost nil when one accounts for types and concentrations of education and time invested into careers but let's look at it this way if women are paid less than men for the same amount of work why in the world would anyone ever hire a man when they could get an equal amount of work out of a woman for 7 of the cost?!?,3,NOT

i'm offended it didn't include attack helicopter gender,2,NOT
the whole thing about the wage gap is that it's talking about averages to examine an actual salary gap you have to look at it in specific fields not across all mediums because it's very clear that if you just average out yearly earnings and divide one by the other you're going to get a very general image of reality the truth is while men have been encouraged to pursue wealth and success for themselves for decades if not centuries) the same incentive wasn't true for women at least for a long time if not still and because of that many more women turn out to be stay-at-home parents or settle for small jobs less women in stem fields less women in big businesses less women in big roles not only because of a structurally sexist academic and professional universe but also because of it i'm sure there would be some difference most likely very significant if you were to compare a man and a woman in similar roles within the same company or across an entire field of work but it probably wouldn't be as latent as the wage gap we've grown accustomed to.,2,NOT
"""both worked full time full time could mean anything from  to  hours per week",1,NOT

this is actually well done considering vox did it ultimately you've shown that more women need to pick better jobs and better education seriously why is is always in business business or nursing and it's because of flexibility however here's the thing vox you've also shown that there is nothing wrong with an earnings gap if women want to take care of the kids fine it's their choice some men are stay at home dads and that number has increased for a few years now if couples decide to have traditional households with women as the caretaker and home maker or if they want to swap roles that's totally their choice whatever the couple decides is their choice and there isn't any reason to persuade women to do anything other than pursue whatever they want to pursue.,2,NOT
how is 50k 0 less than 00k :08,1,NOT
about -7% that's the actual wage gap economists settled on when they took into consideration the different factors that lead to different incomes in the same jobs obviously it varies and it isn't absolutely equal however this article does a very good job of making it seem like the gap is still much bigger than that -7 when all of those factors are taken into consideration.,1,NOT

if you add all the factors such as the jobs men do then you will easily see that wage gap is not a thing.also it's more common for females to stay home with there new born and take more time of then a man so simply adding all the factors up you can clearly tell wage gap is not a thing.,3,NOT
women simply work less,2,NOT
wage gaps if they are real make sense the government expects married women to have a male with a job alongside them to add up to the total salary needed for the family and even if the male doesn't have a job it is a proven statistic men do better than women this means performance determines how much you earn for work not your gender.,5,ABU

wait it compares the median wage not the mean that's moronic the median is just the middle number value out of a large sample size it is not useful in comparing statistically the wages of men and women as it either underselling or overselling the differences because of it the median doesn't take any factors into account of the study sample and is just lazy to use.,3,NOT
she is right about one thing women do work less than men due to children and stuff buts thats only natural if you look at it men would face the same thing if they took more of a house husband role too so the wage gap is basically created because women just take care of children more.,2,NOT

i appreciate this study however most of the points it makes for reasons women do not work late is children the conservative side argues that women in general do not work longer hours before i accept this video at face value i would like to see the same study for women without children and see if the wage gap still exists there if it does your video might need some rethinking if it does not your video is legit and make sure the ages of the childless women are about the same as the ages of the women with children or the conservative side will argue that women tend to work harder at an earlier age and that the earlier aged men slack off more than their older counterparts have to have all bases covered,2,NOT
finally vox welcome to logic!,2,NOT
in the same job if they do the same thing they are paid the same of course it wouldn't count on different jobs and a wage gap is how much they get on the same job in the same place earning gap is when you have less because you want more and you spend a lot compared to those who don't.,2,NOT
when will this bs die off the differences are not existent when you take someone in the same profession working in the same part of the world to eliminate regional differences in pay and labors laws) the feministics twist this truth to suit them by combining the earnings of all men and women without regard for age profession or any other factors obviously an engineer is going to earn more than a teacher and a doctor is going to earn more than them that's just how it is considering the fields men and women work in due to their own interests and dreams we find that women tend to work as teachers nurses etc which are not very high paying jobs but come with a social component and are much lighter on the workload men tend to take more stressful and dangerous jobs ranging from mining sewage engineering off-shore work and more they are obviously much more strenuous and dangerous to one's life and limb but are crucial for civilization to function hence their pay is equally large by explicitly avoid this piece of common sense these feminists are peddling lies openly and people still buy it it's annoys me to no end that people are not using their brains even a little bit if you paid a doctor only as much as a regular office worker why would anyone go through the years long hell and massive risk to be a doctor same with engineers miners and so on.,3,NOT

tl:dr anyone with an issue over this gap is either understand it or is to the extreme far left desiring not equality of opportunity but equality of outcome.,2,NOT
so it's caused by a legitimate disadvantage of having to take on the majority of child rearing that seems reasonable why is there so much vitriol and disbelief does anyone deny that having to care for a child takes effort that could otherwise be used towards a career and that that effort comes mostly from women i believe these statements to be true based on what i've observed and if they are true than it is obvious women have a disadvantage when it comes to having a business career leading to a wage gap it may not be true in your specific field but it is true in a general sense and we should work towards fixing it where we can.,1,NOT
"men and women earn the same money in all regulated industry if women get less money it's because they do less work it's as simple as that a real way of looking at the statistic at the beginning of the video is women on average only do 9 of the overall work that men do on average).""",2,NOT
what is this based vox i'm shook.,2,NOT
and now for my final thought if this mythical wage gap exists its due to your personal irresponsibility kids divorce etc thats your problem dont make it societys problem its called birth control youre woman i hear you roar now let me see you work;),5,ABU
what this fails to show is the fact the the other male half of the home is probably working  hours a day days a week to provide for the family the woman is doing a disproportionate amount of home work... well the man is doing a disproportionate amount of dangerous labor and working an aggressive overtime schedule stop blaming society for a problem that doesn't exist.,3,NOT
responding purely to the title then leaving the page cause i don't need to listen to propagandistic bullshit so what is it that people miss about the wage gap the fact that it doesn't exist.,3,NOT

honestly this is common sense they taught this at my school when we were 4-1 years old.,1,NOT
there's also the part about the same job the same amount of work the same workplace people will often focus on this especially sjw's yet they dint understand that if this is actually the case then what they're doing has been illegal since 96 when president john f kennedy passed a law that stated that with the exception of raises it is illegal to pay anyone less or more than any other for the same amount of work in the same profession at the same workplace people often miss things like this however in 01 9 women went on trial for this law and approx in were deemed legitimate which still works after adding in false negatives and removing false positives.,2,NOT

it's a career and schedule gap most men i know have there hour shifts let's say - but usually leave closer to about  plus as a business owner would you really want to invest more in a man who can do good work well into his 0s and 0s or invest in a women who is required to have at least months maternity leave whenever she has a kid which means you gotta pay to fill her position either overtime or a temp who's hourly wage is higher than everyone elses what if she decided to have a kid every year you'll get sued for trying to fire her plus at their 0s and 0s women go through menopause which studies done by women asking other women have shown that menopause reduces their productivity in the work place if you hire a  year old man for  years you get  good years of work if you hire a  year old woman for  years assuming she has kids you get  / years of work plus you get  months to years of sub par menopause work hiring women is bad business.,5,ABU

expect its illegal to under pay women but whatever,2,NOT
high end high demanding lawyer firms struggle to keep women as their employees because women usually marry someone of equal social status and higher they often have a husband who makes about the same as they do plenty of money these are jobs where the firm calls a top lawyer at am in the morning to solve an issue for a company that would otherwise cost them millions and the lawyer gets paid 0 dollars hour for that and what happens only the men are crazy enough to keep doing that and the women resort to a less demanding lawyer job.,3,NOT

damn a video that isn't completely biased good job.,1,NOT
this just makes me want to attend business school,1,NOT
there are only two questions relevant here  do women get paid less for doing the same job title with the same job requirements as men no the don't because that is illegal  do women have the same opportunity to move into higher paying jobs and demand the same pay as men via negotiations yes they do once these are considered any difference is purely down to the choices made by men and women and if women want to have kids they must accept that they are going to suffer in terms of pay but if they want kids clearly kids are more important than a career so who are you to judge?,3,NOT
this seems to only pay attention to white women white women get 7 cents for a man's dollar black women get 6 cents and latina women get 5 cents if your feminism isn't intersectional you ain't doing it right.,1,NOT
so what you mean is the gender pay gap doesn't exist,2,NOT
tl;dr the wage gap is produced by women's choices not discrimination were it otherwise companies would only hire women to pay them less and save 21 on their labor costs...duh?,2,NOT
lol female economists doing their research on wage gap aka being useless and wasting time there isn't any respected economist that ever considered this wage gap thing of any significance the fact that it's still talked about from mid 0th century till now is proof that no professional actually cares about it because it simply doesn't exist and if it does there doesn't appear to be any effects on the economy it's merely something for media and women rights activists to play with.,5,ABU

it's because of different passions more woman choose to go to lower playing jobs than men like teaching because of their personal preference and more men wok in construction and computer science which you are payed higher.,3,NOT

women tend to take more time off work and take more breaks off work and ask for raises less and they tend to work in fields with less paying jobs,3,NOT
why do feminists think a career is more important than a happy family?,3,NOT
who came here to see the comments,1,NOT
men work themselves until they're mentally and physically sick men will work at the expense of their relationships and family and friends men will earn money by dishonest or immoral practices but if we change the culture women can do this to i bet you can't wait to teach your daughter these things yay for equalityüòâ,3,NOT
wait....but if women are paid less wouldn't that mean that they'd be the majority cause they're less money? i may be wrong???,2,NOT
as an anti-feminist myself i think this is a great video.,2,NOT
so essentially this video pushes the idea that women need to be given advantages over men in the workplace in order for them to earn the same amount of money to fix a non-issue how egalitarian!,2,NOT
it's a very poor goal to eliminate the wage gap it's far more important for people to choose what they want to do rather than have collectivists decide for you what you should do so that on a graph it looks like things are equal things are never equal not between genders not between races heck i have poor eyesight and couldn't become a pilot if i wanted to the point is that people get somewhat equal opportunities and get to make the choices of what they want to do not have some regressive outlet prescribe that we need to businesses shaped in a specific way so that aggregate earnings of men and women are equal what a stupendously poor goal.,3,NOT
very informative video thanks for that but please please stop this vocal fry madness it's hard to concentrate on the content when your ears tell you to stop watching.,3,NOT

that's depend do they work the same hours and do the same kind of work,2,NOT
in the gap graph around :00 we see women born in 94 having a wage gap that decreases from the ages of 0-70 how is this happening why isn't the initial child-bearing gap ages 5-40 persisting throughout their careers shouldn't that gap be very hard to close for example if i save less when i'm younger it's hard to catch up  to close a savings gap  with someone who saves more when she's younger. are older women getting better raises and wages relative to older men indeed much better raises and wages to close that early gap or is it simply that the initial gap in actual dollars matters less and less as a percentage as the numbers/salaries get bigger?,2,NOT

lol you're showing these graphs of how much chores men and women do and how much time they spend with the kids that stuff is so biased those aren't things you can measure those statistics were probably aquired by asking women their opinions on how much their husbands help around of course it'd be low.,3,NOT

so the wage gap exists because of life choices makes sense if i work more on call more and am willing to relocate further,2,NOT
see this is buzzfeed but better because here they're actually unbiased and don't have 364 channels to keep track of,1,NOT
to be honest there really isn't a wage gap and if there is it's near nothing it's an earnings gap.,2,NOT
it's not a fact you lying bimbo it's illegal to pay a woman less for the same job it's a reflection of personal choice how many women want to go into engineering or masters of business management mba or computer programming it's going to get worse the more chicks take gender or ethnic studies in college they have no economic worth so good luck ladies!...and don't blame anyone but yourselves for ..your poor life choices....we're not in the mood go make me a sandwich! kout,5,ABU

the only thing women are better at then men is giving birth changing nappies and ironing men are better at everything else that's why men are paid more,5,ABU
if i was an employer and i could get away paying women less why woudnt i just employ all women lol save me money logic.,3,NOT
feminists are always whining about something they claim they are fighting for equalities when in fact they're fighting for superiority over man how can the so called wage gap be zero and .7 is so small it's negligible considering men work as spies or other dangerous jobs!,3,NOT
thank you vox for finally telling the truth that the wage gap and in fact all wage gaps are due to individual choice any wage gap between men and women is no different then between a doctor and dog sitter all individuals choices,2,NOT
if there is a gender pay gap and people are just discriminating against women why do female fashion models make more than male models?,3,NOT
i'm pleasantly surprised at this video from vox also the gender wage gap to the dollar is actually around cents less than men this is as the video states partially due to child bearing and raising a family but there is more to this part of it can also be women being told you'll only make this much compared to men because of the wage gap so they don't strive to succeed more or perhaps move into a lesser job or even worse go into gender studies and only spend their life cursing the frightening patriarchy men generally being more aggressive when it comes to jobs as in more actively asking for a raise or promotion.,2,NOT
gender wage gap blah blah blah,3,NOT
a wage gap video that takes variables into account.,1,NOT
"""wage gap aka 00 bullshit.",3,NOT
hm never thought of it this way that's interesting,1,NOT
women are smaller weaker and dumber and therefor should on average be paid less.,6,ABU
so there's no wage gap just an earnings gap employers aren't sexist maybe people will finally listen.,2,NOT
harambe wage gap,2,NOT

men should of course also take a greater responsibility for families but maybe that is longer down the line ..,2,NOT
the wage job does not exist,2,NOT
i must of missed that fact that it even existed... maybe because it doesn't,2,NOT
same pay for same position promotions and raises based on merit its how it is and its how it should be.,2,NOT
if women earned less than men in the same exact job why would anyone hire any men if women really earned .7 for every  a man earns that would mean companies would spend less on wages if there was an all woman workforce if that was true every job would be taken by women,3,NOT
wait are you really defending the existence.of a wage gap now that everybody sane is trying to debunk it i worried that soon we'll see a video of why women should receive a salary for having kids.,3,NOT
finally a video on the age gap which understands some economics it's pretty freaking refreshing.,1,NOT
it doesn't exist that's what people are missing,2,NOT
earnings gap not a wage gap if you could pay a woman less to do the same job then every company would hire women.,2,NOT
there is no wage gap just an earnings gap also pay discrimination is illegal.,2,NOT
i like how this video makes out like women suddenly out of nowhere get this horrible burden that is a child and have no choice but to take on a lot of the responsibility that's just what mothers do mom takes care of the kids if they're sick dad picks up an extra shift mom goes to the recital dad picks up an extra shift ez.,3,NOT
why dont women just have less kids i dont think any would really mind if a family has one or two children instead of or three children also women with a lot of kids almost never work if you have three kids then u really shouldnt expect to go back to work until right around when the gap shrinks again.,3,NOT
it almost sounds like the wage gap is the product of men and women making their own decisions and there is a statistical difference in the decisions women make vs men i see nothing wrong with this.,2,NOT
there are many wayst o solve this wage gap problem i personally don't see it as a problem so long as earnings per hour is the same) these mannerisms are all purely social and it boils down to undemonizing men and fathers as incompitent holliwood loves to show the mother as the does everything and the men as unparenting' and if they are a good parent they are a divorced b mother died or c learning the mother is always more compitent in shows and movies in parenting this provides a social stigma that if there is a child in the family the man isn't the main influence it's the woman this makes bosses in the business district highly uneasy with giving women promotions to jobs that require heavier hours or more rigorous work when they are pregnant as they will also have the burden of their children now another example is that in a core family ideal it is the man who does the work and the woman who stays home now when this ideal shifts it's interesting to see how people react if both parents are working they're both valued and putting money on the table if the father is working and the mother is not it's considered a normal basic family if the mother is working and the father is taking care of the house he is often considered a leech and a deadbeat thus the men in order to avoid social hatred from peers and so on always gets a job or at least most men will try to get a job a woman on the other hand doesn't always need a job to be considered acceptable or normal a very huge example of this is in the military there is a large amount of males in there in a stable secure and well paying job while a large amount of women associated with the army happen to just be house wives without much of a job stastically this forces the wage gap to be in men's favor since they are socially required to be employeed or they're considered practically on the same boat as criminals and meth heads finally this wage gap will probably never be fixed because of that earlier detail i mentioned the military is a dangerous job as well as lots of other jobs it's clear that men favor or do not mind dangerous jobs that could result in injury or death while women on the other hand do not favor those jobs dangerous jobs pay more.,3,NOT
so allow woman to work whatever shifts they want ya that won't negatively effect the business landscape look the wage gap is a myth i won't beat a dead horse im just so sick of hearing about it.,3,NOT
wait icecream testing is a job im in,1,NOT

crazy how vox has ignored this video completely also there is no wage gap it is an earnings gap don't bring up the race gap‚Äù it is illegal the equal pay act of 96 made that illegal,2,NOT
can we please start calling it the earnings gap instead of the wage gap wage gap implies that something unfair is going on and it's extremely intellectually dishonest.,2,NOT
wage gab does not exist,2,NOT
they left out the part about men being forced to do all the dirty/dangerous jobs in society and how those jobs pay a premium for the danger that also plays a role in the wage gap when are we going to try to close the death on the job gap over 3 of the people who die on the job are men is that less important than women making less money than men even though in reality women control 0 of the total purchasing power in america.,3,NOT
they make it seem like that is all there is to the wage gap though what they said s true some women do suffer from pure discrimination when it comes to how they are paid.,2,NOT
money is worth nothing on its own its what you buy with it that has value right women control where 70 of all money is spent even if women as a whole made 0 of the money men make they would still have more effective spending power than men.,3,NOT
you really think if these greedy corporations could get the same job done by paying less they wouldn't do it it's like saying why sports person makes more money than a teacher simply because they bring in the revenue.,2,NOT
finally someone says the right thing and this coming from vox of all people,1,NOT
"if two people have the same demand from other workplaces same experience same education same grades same connections and in every single way are identical to the workplace then they should get the same salary per hour that's simple the wage gap in many cases if not most) comes because women value family time and social time higher than men do they also on average have more sick days than men do then you have the whole baby making period in the 0-4 year period for women.. if a man and a woman started out fresh out of university at the same job and same salary the statistics tell us that a man will sacrifice family time and social life to work more all these extra hours give more experience more connections and you'll be more in demand by workplaces because of that in return that gives you a higher salary likewise a career woman that did all the same sacrifices that the man did will be similarly payed for their experience however another difference in men and women also determines their salaries and that's how much they demand a man will typically not be afraid of conflicts or stress in salary negotiations where as a woman will typically fold earlier and get a lower salary why because men are psychologically plugged or trained/influenced while growing up that men don't quit and women you have to sit pretty"" is it right or wrong neither each and everyone has their life to control if you want a career and rise to the top you have to sacrifice something if you want a family and time for kids and a lot of friends then you have to sacrifice something else biologically and psychologically we're predisposed to certain things as a man i would love to be a stay at home dad and take care of the kids house and things like that however i work in education which also satisfy my desire to be around kids and teach with that comes many different advantages and disadvantages just like other types of work or lifestyles do point is that everyone needs to stop looking to blame others for their own shortcomings or sacrifices money isn't the only thing wealth can be measured in some  year old man or woman that sacrificed family and friends in order to build their career might have money but they don't have the same social life or family bonds again you pick what you want ..don't blame anyone else for that.",5,ABU

please stick to scientific videos instead of trying to push this leftist lie on your viewers.,2,NOT
the real question is why do you want to close the gender wage gap by closing that gap other gaps will exist like an age wage gap nationality wage gap political affiliation wage gap earring choice wage gap etc.. are you going to close all of them what for why so?,3,NOT
this isn't an issue woman in general just make different career choices than men.. working less or not at all in order to stay at home and raise the kids isn't a bad thing,2,NOT
if a woman you know is earning less than a man for the exact same job you should call a lawyer women have equal opportunity in modernised countries which means that they are free to pursue the same careers that men do the fact that less women choose to do this is where the wage gap comes from it's a result of a personal decision from a woman and if it's problem then more women should be transferring to the higher risk jobs that men dominate through fair process not discrimination and closing that gap we don't need to look into the wage gap because there is no difference in women's earning for the same job there is no discrimination in this gap between incomes and therefore it isn't an issue this isn't a feminist argument this is a study of the choices women make and they make those choices not because of some form of oppression or patriarchy but because they have the freedom to choose their job and less women choose high risk high paying jobs it doesn't prove anything other than that i'm not saying people can't research it it's quite interesting to observe human choices but i'm saying that this can never be used to advocate a feminist issue because the way it is misrepresented over and over again makes it sound like one and anyone who uses it as such is either intellectually dishonest or retarded.,3,NOT
oh wow cant believe theres a video on the wage gap thats fact based kudos.,1,NOT
1:5 please give data from the last two decades and not half a century ago,2,NOT
props for making this video it¬¥s informing and i like how you guys not going with the black and white approach,1,NOT
so basically the wage gap which is really an earnings gap exists because of the careers men and women pursue and the number of hours worked i don't see where this is a problem if women decide to work as many hours and pursue the exact same careers as men do they'd be earning the same if this was a true wage gap which insinuates that for equal work men and women get paid unequally all businesses would hire women over men cutting their employment costs.,2,NOT
no one cares sorry,2,NOT
cough cough feminist,2,NOT
i almost congratulated vox for making a good video.. then they moved past why the pay differences in men and women is what it is.. such as seniority and hours worked,1,NOT
"being a primary caregiver is not a disease nor is anyone forced into it ask any of them those choose to be the primary caregiver because that's what they want raising children is a team exercise and there is nothing wrong with divvying up the responsibilities nor is it at-all honest to they're both working full time so they should be the same"" because they're not men on average work a hell of a lot more hours even among full time workers.",2,NOT
sucessful worthwhile men want women who can take care of children women who don't want to take care of kids should not expect to get married by sucessful men.,3,NOT
cry babies disliking the video aproaching,3,NOT
so essentially men get paid more because they are more able to compete successfully for the difficult requirements of labor in different fields if we are to look to basic economics as a guide it would be more economical for men to specialize in these areas where they possess an advantage and for women to specialize in the areas where they possess an advantage considering the fact that what determines the specialization of the sexes are biological realities it is fairly irrational and uneconomical for women to desire to enter into the workforce in any economy that values efficiency of production.,5,ABU
in the us 2012) there were  employed men for every 0 women employed.,2,NOT
you legit debunked your own video woman pay more attention to kids and males are more likely to do overtime because they are seen as the provider,3,NOT
hmmmm that's odd i disliked the video automatically,2,NOT
if you can't work the extra hours of course you won't make as much i'm glad harvard is devoting researchers to something we already know,2,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earning of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination.,3,NOT
their isn't one,2,NOT
"""men should take care of the children no it has always been women even back to the stone age they are biologically fit for taking care of kids",5,ABU
princess treatment of girls is the curse that make them vulnerable on reality check lessons taught to boys must be taught to girls ) learn skills to fix your others problems as no god or man will come to fix those ) generate resources add value b being consumer ) go to point b before even thinking about babies i myself was a born artist i gave it up to become engineer as art only adds problems engineering provides solutions.,3,NOT
so what should be done is try to shrink the gender gap here :25 the society expects for the mothers to do more and mothere actually do more.,2,NOT
there is a theory that states that after accounting for variables even though women still earn less it is likely because they are far less agressive when negotiating wages and asking for raises whereas men tend to be more heavy handed in requesting raises.,3,NOT
work more earn more.,2,NOT
well the obvious solution is to have men get pregnant as well.. i mean we have to assume that more mothers are going to want to take time off to raise the child they made vs the fathers we have to make people women make people it takes a lot of dedicated time women are going to have less time to work/experience than men in the same age group the only way to make up for that disparity is to artificially inflate wages for women lets be honest that's what we're talking about right?,2,NOT
proofe that feminism is bullshit,3,NOT
"i love how far they reach to hold onto their victim hood no really if you look at if from this angle its plan to see im a victim.""",3,NOT
there really isn't a wage gap.. the thing people call a wage gap is actually an earnings gap when you compare women and men who do the same job work the same hours make the same sacrifices to their social life and family the gap shrinks to so close to equal you could never tell the difference.,2,NOT
i would have loved if the video also included some information about mitigating factors like the fact that women while earning less money on average are the majority money spenders and also gender pension gaps men paying more into it while women are the primary beneficiaries and other such mitigating factors which render the gender wage gap meaningless and might actually flip things considerably towards men being the disadvantaged ones in the whole picture society is much more complicated than single data points.,5,ABU
"1:1 unless i need to retake basic mathematics i believe that 50,00 is not 0 less than 00,00 but okay",2,NOT
so it's not a wage gap it's an earnings gap.,2,NOT
the gender wage gap can never be used as an point of argument anymore because it is just saying that there are only genders male/female when really that is just assuming everyone's gender which really triggers me,3,NOT
has vox considered that perhaps women would prefer working longer hours at home and men would prefer working longer hours at work everyone makes tradeoffs and those tradeoffs often result in different wages there is nothing wrong with this and it's a mistake to assume any difference between aggregate male wages and aggregate female wages is an injustice that must be remedied.,3,NOT
how can u compare when people got different occupation and stuff....,2,NOT
the fact that women are more carrying with children is obvious . women have to stay with kids home while the man goes to work since that happens men gain up to 0 more income bcs they can adapt to the working schedule women better parent men better worker ...a quick summary of the video,5,ABU
"you need to invest in a sociology book or even dabble in a little bit of phycology vox invest in some real research woman don't tend to spend over years in college but males do there is no wage gap"" just an intelligent gap by the way your wage gap on the business end is way off how many females own a business compared to males?blame it on having babies close your dam legs!",5,ABU
doesnt exist vox,2,NOT
thank you liked!,1,NOT
can some one tell me why the starting pay is different i'm interested to know why the starting salaries are not the same.,1,NOT
nice propoganda here vox,3,NOT
earnings gap not wage gap big difference men are willing to work longer hours and are more flexible with working strict schedules.. is it any surprise they earn more on average but for each hour their wage is still the same as their female counterparts wagegapmyth,3,NOT
all of a sudden there's genders when it comes to money.. please don't assume my gender btw i openly identify as a lawnmower not a male),3,NOT
when you do anything to get views,2,NOT
so basically wage gap is a myth created by incompetent researchers and propagated by feminazis ?,3,NOT
can any wage gap believer please point to the job workplace or employer that pays women less per hour than men for the same job please /,2,NOT
i really enjoyed the video but it ended off by saying that we can fix the wage cap by changing hours that's good and all but we must not deter from the true goal of viewing each other as equals remember everyone respect women!,1,NOT
they say a woman's job is never done which is probably why they get paid less just kidding there is no wage gap.,3,NOT
a logical and rational presentation that covers more comprehensive than the simple flawed 0. theory instant dislikes from feminists,3,NOT
yea the wage gap is a perfect example of statistics being interpreted to suit someones needs its this fallback point that everyone uses cause it seems so unfair and they always use stats from degree educated people that work in still sexist fields of work the vast majority of people work for minimum wage and you don't see mcdonalds paying a woman 9c on the dollar just because of her gender she makes the same crap wage as the men there also men have a way higher rate of depression/injury/suicides at work cause they work themselves to death so their wife and kids won't leave them and shack up with a guy with a better paying job.,3,NOT
i believe the saying you get out what you put in if a girl works in a normal job and only meeting the standard she is only getting the basic paycheck but if a guy works in a great job and putting more effort with more efficiency he is going to get the better paycheck.,2,NOT
"""what people miss about the gender wage gap that it's fake.",3,NOT
so the key to closing the wage gap is to make more flexible hours that would be great for everyone so you can plan your own schedule to fit your specific needs gotta get to the root of the problem rather than just seeing the surface.,2,NOT
a lot of people use this explanation as an opportunity to be complacent in preventing workplace inequality it's fine that women are paid less because they take care of their kids sucks for them such is life. in reality workplaces should be child friendly in that they offer support to working moms working moms are citizens too and should have equal opportunity in the workplace they shouldn't be punished for yielding a new generation.,2,NOT
how dare you bring actual facts into this debate,1,NOT
well according to the bureau of labor women earn less than men in jobs female dominated male dominated and gender equal just saying,1,NOT
this is false.. the biggest thing that shows that is the fact that no-one ever says the same numbers,3,NOT
people want women to not only work to earn money to support the family but also take over majority of the household work and childcare/child rearing in other words men wants women to be superwomen but don't want them to complain at all sure some men share the household work but according to the stats that is like only a low single digit percent it's kinda sad.,1,NOT
child-rearing who'd have thunk it seriously you need a study for this more seriously this seems to be just another instantiation of how men an women are and behave differently meaning if we collect all factors contributing to the so called wage gap' we likely find out the playing field was level all along the players just moved differently on it.,2,NOT
i think a big part of closing the wage gap is going to be empowering men to be the primary caregivers of children.,1,NOT
it's not like women were made to take care of children,5,ABU
the waaaaaaaaage gap isn't real,3,NOT
i thought that this would debunk the wage gap as what it really is being an earnings gap the earnings gap states that overall women make less than men with roughly  cents to a dollar being the figure that they come up with this is statistically true since on average most studies on the subject have shown that men more often ask for raises apply for the highest paying jobs ie. stem) tend to go into overtime more often and that men aren't biologically capable of having children as such men tend to work longer hours and with the same pay earn more women on the other hand have all of these obstacles to overcome if they are to work for the same time and earn as much the icing on the cake is that the pay gap has been made illegal therefore all companies who do this are to go to federal prison as such there wouldn't be a pay gap anywhere in the united states might i suggest you research what you hear before making a video.,3,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination name the youtuber,2,NOT
1:2 notice how the gap increases steadily in prime pregnancy years...hmmmmmm i wonder if there could be a correlation?,3,NOT
what people miss on the wage gap is that it don't really exist unless you're a feminist and just want to get paid more for doing less,3,NOT
her accent is so annoying.,3,NOT
still being stupid by calling it a wage gap stay dumb and in denial vox.,3,NOT
478 feminists were triggered by this.,3,NOT
most people miss the fact that it isn't real.,2,NOT
yeah men make more but men work more stupid woman,5,ABU

jordan b peterson,3,NOT
there's a wage gap and income gap...,2,NOT
if employers could get away with paying women less for doing the exact same job no one would ever hire men people make exactly what they earn.,3,NOT
plus it should not be called wage gap but earnings gap or something.,2,NOT
uh...its kinda against the law to pay someone less because of their gender what wage gap?!!,2,NOT
wage gap is a lie,2,NOT
woah i was pleasantly surprised this wasn't a feminazi!üòµüëåüèº,3,NOT
it does not e x i s t period,2,NOT
there simply is no wage gap,2,NOT
it's funny how vox admits that the argument is total bull at the very beginning of the video they admit that the wage gap is based on nothing but median wages of both men and women do you understand what that means that is the average of all female wages compare to all male wages it has nothing to do with females making less money for their time at the same job as a man it only means men spend more time working on average men tend to get pregnant at a far lower rate than women men tend to work more over time than women statistically men are more likely to do high risk jobs that have high pay men are less likely to work minimum wage low skill jobs than women men are more likely to work night shift jobs than women men are more likely to do physical jobs than women men are more likely to pursue lucrative college degrees than women men are more likely to own a business than women men are more likely to do dirty jobs than women men are more likely to stay with the same company for long periods of time than women not for doing the same jobs these are just a few of the examples of why if you compare the totals men make more than women after all if a company could get away with paying women 5 less than men they would only hire women.,3,NOT
are we just going to say that women get paid less than men even though in 4 out of 5 of the wealthiest cities in america women make an average of percent more than men this statistic kinda destroys the whole argument that there is sexism not to mention women on average work fewer hours additionally women are less frontal so in a job like a business they would probably not be very good at it for the reasons you said and others business would be a terrible job option for women and to say that is due to sexism is ridiculous because of a male babysitter makes horribly less money than a female one yet no one chalks that up to sexism men will do a worse job when it comes to caring for children just like how women will struggle in jobs that require force its all biological yes women can display force but biologically they aren't forceful vox fortunatley took a factual approach to this and not just outright saying that sexism is the reason as i have seen people do in the past but saying that women jsut need to blanket get paid the same as men are stupid we need to look on a more individual level try to find a women who does the same exact hours as a man has the same experience has the same job and does literally everything the same as the man and she does the same level of quality as the man and i guantee you she will get paid the same amount unless you look at another statisctic which states that women are 0 less liekly to push for more money this is alos led to a gap not because of sexism but due to bioligical inscurities.,5,ABU
if you are reading this you have come too far and shouldn't go any further.,1,NOT
men are more likely to ask for raises,2,NOT
people also miss that the wage gap doesnt exist,2,NOT
never made mention that men typically work more and longer hours thus increasing pay also that men are more likely to go for higher pay in riskier jobs like mining and oil drilling.,3,NOT
it's pretty hard to believe in this wage gap when you aren't affected by it i mean why would someone pay females less than males it makes no sense but my mother has experienced this wage gap and institutional sexism in the workplace when she found out by accident that her male counterparts who had been working the same job same hours same past experience were getting higher wages than her for no apperant reason call it a lone case or a sexist boss but this could be happening anywhere in front of your eyes oh and this happened in a country with probably the most gender equality in the world.,1,NOT

4:4 wtf theres still a gap though,2,NOT
well women are better at multitasking and taking care of children resulting in lower paying jobs like taking care of their own children or being a teacher or a waitress and men are generally stronger and can focus on one thing better resulting in better jobs like engineering these are just natural born instincts and so if a women has a job that men can kind of do better the quality of work might be less than a man's quality of work resulting in being paid less i don't know this for a fact but i think that is a possibility right?,5,ABU
everybody who works good get paid good,2,NOT

my last job i worked  years towards becoming supervisor only to have a horrible women who was bff with a head board member became my supervisor in months so i am not buying into the wage gap it is fake.,2,NOT
i was expecting a video blaming the patriarchy god i hate that word for oppressing women by decreasing their salaries but this video presented a really good very well-proven argument yet another great vox video but i have a question someone in the comments mentioned that in some countries like india schedule flexibility isn't the or the biggest cause of the gender gap they didn't present any proof but i was hoping that someone who knows about the topic could clear it up.,1,NOT
with the pharmacy example . they're saying we shouldn't own our own business to reduce the wage gap better to work for a multi billion dollar company than be your own boss.,2,NOT
wait wait wait at the end you were saying with jobs with more flexiable hours the pay gap is less but why?,1,NOT
what they miss is something that ceases to exist.,2,NOT

at first freelee i actually hated you i thought you were rude i really thought that you should have minded your own buisness but still i kept being subscribed to you still watched your videos day after day i saw videos of you telling celebs to carb the fuck up and telling them how fucking wrong it is to eat animal products today is my first day on a plant-based diet i couldnt thank you enough for spreading the messege and showing the brutal and honest truth without your honest words and the footage you show in your videos i wouldnt be on a vegan-diet today and i love it! i couldnt thank you enough.,2,NOT

hi freelee i've been thinking on going vegan for such a long time now i'd say probably months?? but i've never gotten around to this because my parents don't support this opinion and all they cook is animal based products i'm  so obviously i can't move out lol) i was wondering if you had any tips for going vegan even when everyone around you eats meat i naturally have never been obsessed over meat tbh like i never found the tastiness about it so that is not really what my problem is my problem is that my parents will not buy the large amounts of fruit that i need for the raw till diet that i really want to get to is there a better way to still be a high carb vegan without doing the raw till diet? thank you for influencing me and making me realize that animal based products are disgusting :,1,NOT

i just watched the from farm to fridge video and i'm so disturbed and upset by it i made the decision to cut pork out of my diet when i was only years old because of my love for pigs and my realisation at the mistreatment of them at most slaughterhouses in the uk i have still continued to eat other meats and dairy products but after seeing that i am seriously considering cutting all of that out of my diet freelee i think you spreading awareness like this is awesome and inspiring and i'm so glad that you come on here and present people with the harsh truth of the unethical treatment of these animals i've always been wary of your videos thinking you were too harsh or mean and uncalled for but now i realise you really just do it to impact people and make them realise that this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed keep doing what you're doing xxx,1,NOT

success this is wonderful:),1,NOT
let's all stop bashing trisha for everything i understand that she needs to be held accountable for her actions but in saying that i think this is a huge step and we should all support her in this time of change as opposed to tearing her down.,1,NOT
so she hates on trish until trish makes a video about what a god freelee is interesting,3,NOT

this is pure waffleüòÇ,2,NOT
how could you say that you're transgender just because you're attracted to gay men shame on you shameüëèonüëèyouuuuuuuu üò°,3,NOT
trish i love being a thicc boi. also trish i wore sports bras because i was self conscious about my boobs.‚Äù,3,NOT
trish could have saved everyone this mess if she just understood what gender fluid is...,3,NOT
gender fluid pansexual im l o s t,2,NOT
this bitch is still around?? must be losing views and subs....,5,ABU
someone come get their friend üëéüèº,3,NOT
i think she's just misunderstanding these terms therefore incorrectly explaining how she identifies as transgender male‚Äù,2,NOT
so is she called tristan now?,2,NOT
you faked being lgbt once why would you think we would believe you a second time?,3,NOT
no disrespect but it sounds more like gender fluidity than transgender but you know you better than me just saying what i thought about how you described everything much love trish keep doing you boo üíïüíïüíïüí´,1,NOT
it's confusing.. but i get it in a way.,2,NOT
way to stereotype gay males... and everyone else,3,NOT
yall know trish is a troll right,3,NOT
do you know what gender dysphoria is??,3,NOT
what did i just watch,3,NOT
as a transgender man i agree and experience some of the things trisha said but also greatly disagreed with other things i'm not going to say trisha is lying or trying to just get attention right now but i'm not fully convinced since trans people should transition to identity as their trans identity i'm on the fence and wether or not i take this seriously all relys on trisha's actions from this moment on,2,NOT
trisha having a zit doesn't all the sudden make you a guy lmao,3,NOT
trisha are you okay,3,NOT
i think she's simply mixing up her terms definitely seems genuine though,2,NOT
"""do i think i'm transgender yes a thousand percent do i identify with my birth gender yes it doesn't work that way.",3,NOT
"""do i identify as trans 000% do i identify as my birth gender 000% bitch what that literally defeats the whole purpose! like i appreciate her being open-minded and accepting of the trans community but you really can't make a whole ass video coming out as trans when you're literally contradicting yourself the whole time and very clearly are not trans",3,NOT
trish i thought you knew better,2,NOT
annnnnnnd there goes my last braincell,3,NOT
"""i'm all about boobs that was hella uncomfortable for me to say btw) hello i'm lyam i'm transgender ftm) if you are able to say boobs and say you're girly or say that you were female at birth is absolute bullsh**t if you were able to say thoes words without feeling dysphoric hate to say it but you're not transgender you're just an sjw that is in it for the fame and money because you get paid to make these videos that means you're basically using the lgbtq trans community for money and your own comfort we fought long and hard for our spot today we get harassed and bullied for being who we are some of us even commit sucide because we don't feel comfortable in our body this is really fucked up of you if you were trans and had the freedom to transition you would have done it by now quit the bullshit and stop making the trans community look stupid.",6,ABU
its really spooky season,3,NOT
trish i know this may sound crazy but when i was in middle school i would hate it when old men would creep on me so i guess im trans!,3,NOT
baby i support your gender identity but this does not sound to me like being a trans man however this does very much sound like gender-fluid identifying female sometimes male sometimes sometimes neither sometimes both.,2,NOT
i dont think theres anything wrong with what she said,1,NOT
i've followed trish through everything her relationships her mental breakdowns her glow ups her going through her mental disorders all of it but this this is something else.,3,NOT
coming from a trans man this isn't how it fucking works trish you need gender dysphoria to be trans gender dysphoria is feeling a disconnect and discomfort in your biological gender's body and you clearly don't have that issue trans men can be gay yes trans men can like makeup and fashion yes but trans men absolutely do not want to be seen as a female? that's against everything we stand for and have to go through this shit isn't a joke trish being trans isn't something you randomly use as an excuse for not liking straight men or for feeling insecure about being called a bitch because you are assertive you are one of the reasons people outside of the community see us as a joke i hope this is either a shitty joke that you somehow thought would be funny or that people realize this isn't how being ftm works.,5,ABU
look what she's talking about is an actual feeling that some of us have due to trisha's past i wouldn't validate that either but she said everything i've felt my whole life...,3,NOT
i think you are just gender fluid..........,2,NOT
trish i'm attracted to gay guys also trish that must mean im a trans man‚Äù,3,NOT
i have to laugh because otherwise i'm gonna lose it...,3,NOT
oh god is she ok i feel a britney moment might be happening soon,3,NOT
trisha coming from someone who fully supported you for years trolling or not girl stop....,2,NOT
idk about this i think you're having an identity crisis.,2,NOT
this is why we should go back to being the gender we are born with,3,NOT
is this because your ex disappeared on you and ended up gay,3,NOT
trisha you are mentally ill this is nothing to be ashamed of rather the opposite often times but for your sake i think you should talk to someone.,5,ABU

okay listen she or he it's whatever the lgbtq is about love and loving all no matter how you feel just because she or he doesn't know the correct terms for what she or he is trying to say doesn't change the fact on how she or he feels this is how she or he feels and that's fine and we should all love that no matter what also with what she or he are saying about the difference between male and female is wrong just bc a guy wears makeup dont make him gay and viceversa so what she's saying is wrong but maybe she doesn't know how to put it yet and that's okay so stop saying all this shit when you have no clue how hard it is to do what she is doing i mean posting it and saying how she or he feels.,1,NOT
basically what i got from this video is that trust wants to be a man and there is nothing wrong with that but she could've just said i wanna be a man instead of this whole video lol,2,NOT
trisha doesnt like labels also trisha do i think i'm trans yes a thousand percent do i identify with my natural born gender yes a thousand percent says right after saying shes both,3,NOT

trisha no just nooo you're give the lgbt community a bad name,2,NOT
i don't think it's all that nice/dignified of you to in the same video even ask for acceptance and love and then put others in that same community down what with your whole not wanting to label yourself as they/them because people will think they're right about you being schizophrenic not only is that incredibly discouraging and insulting to nonbinary/genderfluid trans people its a giant f u to people living with schizophrenia i can only imagine its hard enough coping with hearing and seeing things but imagine using a huge platform to validate unfair negativity toward them smh,3,NOT
i can't tell if she's lost weight or she has gotten botox,3,NOT
isn't this just a drag king no hate just wondering,2,NOT
you are fucking insane you are the reason that transgender people get a bad reputation because people like you convince everyone transphobe that we are all like you trans people are discriminated against every day particularly trans women of color and you are making this video with literally no evidence and no diagnosis of gender dysphoria that medical condition linked with being trans you are a fucking disgrace to the community you claim to be a part of also if you identify 1000% with your assigned gender at birth that completely discredits you being trans',6,ABU
what drugs you doing?,5,ABU
also trish i love you jessssssus,2,NOT
honestly i don't respect you or even support you anymore as a trans man you made me feel disgusted and violated so you can just fuck off,5,ABU
i don't think trisha is on drugs i do think she is having some mental health issues going on and possibly on the verge of a break down she seems very manic/bipolar i hope she gets the mental help she needs.,5,ABU
my reaction when i read the title  bahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahha breathes hahahahahahahahahahhahahahagahahahahhahahahahhahahahah,3,NOT
this video is just every confusing i think your just having alot of stuff going on and not trans not all girl like center of attention not all gay guys like glam and you saying you just relate to guys coz zits and you like gay guys some females are attracted to gay guys and girls obviously have zits to and saying you have penis envy i myself do some girls think its gonna be easier coz no piriods and more i mean you can do you but you make me and some others confused i identify as a they/them and you dont have to transition no defence in anyway but i find this video very un unbelievable ,3,NOT

i think people are literally to blame for this like this crazy chick lives on the internet shouldve never even had the thought of being a male if it wasnt for people being so crazy about it and trying to question everything they do,5,ABU
sad to see so many people hating on someone that has such an incredibly hard time identifying with themselves their body and just who they even are wtf is wrong with y'all get a life,1,NOT
i kinda get it.. wtf.. why is she kinda making some sense i don't have an issue with anything she's saying.. like go one girl live your best life whatever makes you happy fuck it be whoever do whatever as long as you know who you are no one elses opinions matter whatevs.,1,NOT
i think she's trolling or she's on drugs,5,ABU
i think trisha embodies a 950s housewife unfortunately for her and that's the only problem i see here i believe she's confusing gender identity with normal things every person experiences because of this what she says doesn't show me gender confusion it shows me a woman who grew up insecure overcompensated and became overexposed and never learned the concept of acceptance i have pity for her and i think a lot of other people should too.,2,NOT
does me finding this hilarious make me a sociopath cause i do,2,NOT
i don't even see what's wrong yes maybe trisha worded some things wrong but at the end of the day shes questioning let her.,1,NOT
trisha do a bit more research before making a video like this just so you dont get as much hate maybe even like a small script just to outline what to say idk,1,NOT
im gay but this is so fucking funnyhdjzyxnsudb,2,NOT
trisha being a troll never heard of that.,3,NOT
she will get so much shit now d ..,3,NOT
it's so obvious she's doing this for controversy and popularity she's done this time and time again on her channel voted for trump came out as lesbian became emo. yall really dont need to spend the energy to get triggered by such obvious trolling,3,NOT
oh no trish,2,NOT
sis no please stop as a trans ftm guy this is not signs of you being transgender being trans isn't a joke the hormones we take literally will change you please seek a therapist and talk about this with them before posting a video and saying you're trans,2,NOT
so sis just admitted to being a pansexual genderfluid person but is trying to claim ftm homosexual,2,NOT

"""i'm attracted to gay men sis so is gaga and she ain't trans",2,NOT
she made k on this video.,2,NOT
trish you've completely lost it,3,NOT
this is so problematic,2,NOT
the introduction to this video alone hit me really really fucking hard i was a tomboy as a kid got teased for it and felt a lot of pressure to be hyperfeminine as i got older it took me years to realize that as much as i loved being good at being feminine* i didn't like how i looked literally everything you're saying about penis envy about how i felt a struggle between wanting to be a good feminist or a better stronger woman and this nagging idea that i was actually a guy it felt like a betrayal for me to give up my identity as a woman but now that i'm three and a half years on testosterone i know that my body is meant to have t in it kicking gender norms to the curb and escaping the conforms of what society tells you that you have to be being a gender nonconforming man choosing to forgo hormones or getting hormones and surgery all of those are perfectly reasonable you don't have to go hypermasculine to be a gay trans man hell you could date other gay trans men but at any rate you're absolutely welcome here you're not faking being trans. there's no correct way to be trans!!!,1,NOT
so are you a boy or a girl,2,NOT
do your research on what these words mean please i know you didn't mean to be offensive but i feel very attacked and that shit hurt i'm glad you're happy though.,2,NOT
can we stop telling them what they are they chose to identify as this they should be accepted we should respect them as what they want to be if a friend was this video and said these would you act this way just respect them* this can hurt people think with what little wits you have before you post something for i use they/them pronouns because i don't know what gender they are.,1,NOT
‚Äúi like gay guys so therefore i'm a gay man t,3,NOT
the nerve in monetizing this mess.... i can't,3,NOT
i know trish often does any and everything for clickbait....but.......what if she reeeeaaaallly feels this way why does she get shot down when ive seen trans people who have more of the right look or woke rhetoric to go with their commentary pretty much say the same things...she feels like both why is this causing issues if she were skinny and androgynous looking people would totally call her brave for this.,1,NOT
she's just not well-versed about the queer community and a lot of people aren't i think maybe trisha could be non-binary/gender queer but it's a big step to say one is trans i mean everyone has different journeys but being trans or any sexuality or gender shouldn't be announced on a whim or for clout.,2,NOT
how much surgery have u had?,3,NOT
i think i understood geometry more than this ,2,NOT
so she's basically saying she's gender fluid.... but the truth is she just wants everyone to be sexually attracted to her ,3,NOT
liking gay men doesn't mean you're a gay man it just means your trisha,2,NOT
the best thing about this video are the comments.,2,NOT
gay men can be masculine? u don't need to fit a stereotype to be gay this video makes no sense,2,NOT
‚Äúi choose not to identify as multiple personalities i just finished watching her did/personality disorder/alters video üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,3,NOT
does she realize how offensive this is to gigi one of her best friends on the platform who is actually transgender like please sit down and do your research before blabbing on the internet for attention that's all this is it's just for attention so just report the video and move on,3,NOT
maybe look into gender fluid,2,NOT
if you don't want to watch the whole thing it's just her confusing gender identity and sexual orientation.. she is a gay man physically/mentally now because she likes men ..who are also gay and that leads her to believe that she must be a man on the inside. if i may add as a cisfemale i also find the gay men she features on her channel to be extremely attractive but i know that is one sided on my behalf as their sexual orientation doesn't match mine but trisha seems to believe becoming a gay man will solve this dilemma of one sided attractions ,2,NOT
fam you sound gender fluid,2,NOT
wait no ones asking the important question here though will you be participating in no nut november now?,2,NOT
i support everything and everyone don't come at me for supporting this...,1,NOT
yall dont be such a dick to t! the shit she's saying makes sense if you would bother to listen past the terminology that gets mixed up in here what's being said here is that t from the get go has not really felt like a girl but the reason she was so girly so feminine was to compensate for everyone calling her a boy when she was young when she puts on makeup nails clothes etc etc she's in drag it's a costume it's an outfit the way she describes women makes it clear that she doesn't feel like she's one of them i do agree w some people here that what shes describing here sounds more like being genderfluid than binary trans and i do agree that she's mixing up a lot of words but you cannot blame her for ignorance you cannot thrust someone out from the community for not getting everything 00 right we are not born knowing everything that needs to be and should be said or how to say it you need to learn these things at some point and some people do them later than others i for one completely support t and agree with what she's saying even if she's not doing it perfectly you fucking go it's hard to do shit like this.,1,NOT
how can this offensive bs still be online you tube should strike her whole channel please click the three little dots on in the top right and report report this under the violent or repulsive tab,5,ABU
omg is she serious now she is a gay guy or trans i'm so confused she had a boy haircut and now she thinks she is a guy..........,3,NOT
i bet shane is regretting having your name in his palette.,2,NOT
everyone has a different way of identifying bcos trish doesn't identify how you do doesn't mean it's wrong it's trish's view point.,1,NOT
not wanting ur period not liking the societal pressures sexualization abuse u get from being female and wanting to fuck people does not mean ur trans a trans male,2,NOT
drops views and subscribers i feel like a man!,3,NOT
i was watching this and got sooooooo confused,3,NOT
so once in awhile you like to dress up you're attracted to men you can't have and like sensitive men and you wish u had a dick because you associate power with having a penis your thinking isn't that complicated you're not transgender you just haven't had a nice conversation with yourself to think threw your thoughts and feelings talk with your therapist about what you just talked about i have a feeling he might be able to help u out now if he doesn't then u might need a new one.,2,NOT
did you peg jason,3,NOT
this video is most likely a joke,3,NOT
more like transspecies human to land whale.,5,ABU

penis envy stop üòÇ,2,NOT
wtf am i watching,3,NOT
as someone with actual gender dysphoria and who identifies as trans this really pisses me off it's people like trisha who have a large platform and spread wrong information about the transgender community everything she said in this video is wrong i'm not saying that she's wrong or anything but i think she's confused and she doesn't actually know what she's saying she needs to go see a therapist or something and get this figured out before spreading it on social media she needs someone to tell her the difference between feeling more masculine tomboy versus being transgender and having actual gender dysphoria after all she did say that she identified with her sex 000% which you don't find in non binary people trans people or whatever.,2,NOT
who else only came for the comments,2,NOT
what am i getting myself into now,2,NOT
trisha just be who u want to be don't listen to what anyone says their opinion doesn't matter just love yourself and be happy being who u r u can be whatever u want as long as it makes u happy people are gonna hate but that's life and if they can't accept that than the hell with them just make urself happy being u i wish u all the best in ur journey and life.,1,NOT

oh she's lost it completely lost it,3,NOT
god whatever happened to just being a tomboy you relate to boys don't wear makeup etc you have penis envy great so does every girl ever because having a penis and being a man is just so much easier biologically and in the society that we live in its unfortunate but that doesn't mean that you are trans this is just frustrating to watch because so many of the things she is saying are things that everyone experiences and its really disrespectful and discrediting to actual transgender people.,3,NOT
her hair looks so good,1,NOT
i identify as offended who else?,3,NOT
lets be real here everyone who just drags her in the comments is the reason she keeps crying on her kitchen floor her mental health state is going down the goddamn stairs give her a break.,1,NOT

this bitch got me fucked up!!!!!!,5,ABU
i know the vlog squad is having a fucking field day with this video i cant wait for jeff to bring it up in a podcast.,3,NOT
trisha or t or any name you decide to use i don't know where to start with this video i myself am a gay transgender male the huge thing with being transgender is the want for more masculinity than feminism i like to present myself as a male dress as a male be called a male seen as a male nothing else not my birth gender i have dysphoria causing me to dislike my chest my genital and anything that makes me look or seem more like a female all true transgender males have dysphoria and discomfort with being a transgender male you do not identify with being a girl the birth gender you want masculinity you want to be seen as a girl i honestly believe you are a little confused and questioning look into being gender fluid gender fluid is when some days you love to present yourself as a male then some as a female people who are gender fluid us he/him and she/her pronouns most often meaning you don't have to use they/them pronouns please just look into it also a lot of the stuff in your video is very offensive you say you don't like labels yet you're using them gay males are perceived as galled up and feminine in a way but most aren't that way also saying you believe you're transgender due to loving short hair not having to tend to it girls and others can feel the same also when you say straight men turn you off that is so darn weird you automatically aren't attracted to a male because they're not gay that's almost like being transexual only liking and wanting to date trans men and women it's just really strange and i don't agree with judging someone on their sexuality it's almost heterophobia ,3,NOT
this probably won't get seen but trisha i can relate i've always felt more comfortable around men have always had more male friends than female have always been told i have a strong masculine energy and i've always thought my personality would've been better in a mans body i don't believe these factors make someone transgender they are absolutely real and valid feelings but i think you are still trisha you're just moulding that person into who you think others want her to be you need to be you regardless of what is between your legs‚ù§Ô∏è,2,NOT
so basically tomboy and girly 0/50?,2,NOT
i think you meant to say you're gender fluid cuz ur not trans ?,2,NOT

okay bitch stop how can you be trans if you identify as the gender u were bron with??,5,ABU
she said hair lip ,2,NOT
she either is  just doing it for attention  literally delusion as hell and needs help i think she has sexuality and gender mixed up she has shown zero signs of being trans her reasonings to being trans are a joke i am not one to say who u can and cannot be but come on.. she's making trans people look like a joke trisha has been needing serious psychological help the back lash she will/has received from that video is going to change her life forever personally i think she is ignorant on the subject and has sexuality mixed up with gender adding on she has a lot of mental issues that she doesn't know how to control so pushing it on the i'm transgender is the easiest way for her adding on the whole attracted to gay men they are still men shit i like girls and i can see a girl who is lesbian and think she's attractive but that doesn't mean i'm lesbian it still would be heterosexual of me she needs help lastly masculinity doesn't make you male it is a spectrum.,5,ABU

if she feels the way she does she has a right too how is it okay for a man to want to be a women and not get judged but if a women wants to explain the reasoning for her sexuality she's dragged. if to ppl she doesn't sound educated that's fine but she'll learn. it's 01 and ppl need to let her express her self because she didn't have to make this video but she did it to set her self free and to let her supporters know.,1,NOT
i'm mad watching this i'm a trans guy),3,NOT
gender fluidity exists non-binary exists tacking yourself to a constructed stereotype of a gay man just because you want to avert the male gaze is not being transgender i support someone feeling less than cis but this is a fucking train wreck that the trans community now has to field trans people have to fight tooth and nail to be taken seriously and now they're stuck dealing with this.,3,NOT

transgender people have dysphoria if you do not have disphoria then you are not trans and dismorphia and dysphoria are two very different things you can be a masculine female without being trans you can be a feminine man without being trans trish please talk to people who are trans legit people who are trans because i know you are hurting so many people because you are calling yourself trans when you arent.,3,NOT

‚Äúi identify as a gay man and a dragqueen  your sexual attraction has nothing to do with your gender  you can not identify as a dragqueen being a dragqueen is a hobby/profession and a great one i don't mean anything negative by that  being less typically feminine does not make you male being masculine and being male are two different things also being assertive is not being a man that's literally just being assertive.,3,NOT
is this dumb bitch aware that masculine gay men exist too we aren't just all feminine extra flamboyant drag queens not only this is highly transphobic but it's homophobic as shit too why aren't you cancelled yet?,5,ABU

identifying as both male and female is called being genderqueer or genderfluid hun you're confused please learn your terminology before posting a  minute video on something you clearly don't have a vast understanding of.,2,NOT
i understand you're an edgy troll but this video is really hurtful i've been subscribed for years but after this i cant continue to support you you're misinterpreting what it means to be transgender and using it as a way to get attention.,3,NOT

a few years from now a word for the thing that she is describing us will come out.,3,NOT
the thumbnail of the vid looks like a joke for clickbait,3,NOT
not to be like the one to say no trisha youre wrong but for people that identify with being transgender identifying with the sex you was born as isnt a thing that happens like you kinda need to feel dysphoria.. and feeling like both isnt really what trans people typically say maybe youre describing a different feeling i would look into other queer gender identities.,2,NOT
trish i'm not confused youtube watch next im questioning:trish me wtf,2,NOT
sis you do not know the feeling of dysphoria if you did you would not be saying this shit,3,NOT
i might be crazy but anyone else understand trish here and doesn't think she is trolling everything she said can be proved she has always been attached to gay guys she always had lgbtq friends she does either dress up like a drag queen or just roll out of bed i think she just shouldn't label what she is and just go for what she likes.,1,NOT

why is this so controversial its not she is opening up to her followers and how she he feels period it seems like shes still struggling with her identity but that no excuse to judge her to judge how she's feeling or he t.,1,NOT
none of this makes you trans.. penis envy so you can just be assertive and not a bitch.. welcome to the entire female gender!,5,ABU

"you also can't just... invalidate people's pronouns? if someone identifies with they/them pronouns that's not for you to say no that's weird i don't like that.""",2,NOT

as a real transgender man this is ridiculous.,3,NOT
do you use a strap-on with your boyfriend then?,3,NOT
and the most ecofreindly diet of 01 is canibalism xd.,2,NOT
this identity crap by these young american teens is hilarious child i don't care even if you identify yourself as a flower pot you're either a boy or a girl period.,3,NOT
i think she just means she feels non-binary and felt liberated from social expectations of a woman when she dressed like a man i don't think that necessarily constitutes trans man though.,2,NOT
okay i'm fucking done-,3,NOT
so what i'm hearing is. because you have more guy friends then girl friends because you think gay guys are attractive because you didn't like the attention from grown ass men when you were in middle school you're trans gender nice,2,NOT
you moving to canada to follow aaron just curious.,1,NOT

also.. anyone remember when jason david would make gay jokes/skits trisha would talk soooo much shit about it say how unattractive it was when he would act gay i'm finding this hilarious because she contradicts herself so hard like literally always,3,NOT
bruh literally everything you said as to why you identify as a man i can relate with but you're just being sexist like i don't identify as a man just because i don't like attention and don't wear make up every day it's just who i am but i'm still a female like im not against transgender but like you really don't have any plausible explanation to be and it's disrespectful toward people who actually have gender dysphoria and are trans.,5,ABU
nobody me on my period:,2,NOT
please be a joke please be a joke please be a joke,2,NOT
i love how she specified that she was trans female to male in case anyone tought she was mtf,3,NOT
trish wears short hair. trish i'm transgender now.,3,NOT
okay i sort of understand what she's trying to say but. honey if you had genuine gender dysphoria you would have been out a long time ago. that's all there is to it maybe you are gender queer or non binary if anything but you're def not a ftm who adheres to the binary because transsexual trans people whether mtf or ftm) all have gender dysphoria.,3,NOT
i'm actually ok with this...don't me.,1,NOT
back at it again on the kitchen floor can she afford chairs we shall never know.,3,NOT
 a gay man what???,3,NOT
i think the term you're looking for to describe what you are is a human being',2,NOT
this feels like a midlife crisis girl sort your shit out.,3,NOT
i'm sorry there's so much hate she doesn't seem to know a lot about gender and sexuality which is okay i think she is gender fluid and that thats why she's identifying as male she doesnt get that she is both and that that's okay.,2,NOT
ya trisha something is wrong with you because you don't have many girlfriends.. ya that's it,3,NOT

memeber y'all this is the same person who asked if dogs have brains,3,NOT
she's describing more of a gender fluid or a non binary person i don't know if what she was saying in her video describes a transgender male or female i think she has her identity's mixed up she should've done more research before she posted a video trying to express and describe what label she thinks she falls under she still has learning and figuring out to do she needs to take time away from youtube to find herself,1,NOT
trisha i'm attractive to gay men me jason isn't..trisha stfu,5,ABU
ok i know trisha is getting a lot of backlash about this and some of her reasoning might not make a lot of sense but honestly if this how she feels then we should support her,1,NOT
i liked girl-trish better.. somehow she was less naive,2,NOT
wow she really filmed and edited,2,NOT
this video is a big ol oof,2,NOT
so non binary,2,NOT
sounds like she's pansexual and gender fluid,2,NOT
i think shes just genderfluid is what shes trying to say shes obviously confused so instead of hating on her maybe comment tips for her she needs it lol,1,NOT
transitioning to avoid brushing your hair holy shit.,3,NOT
‚Äúi think you can be a guy some days and then i think you can be a girl. whatever she said boi aint that gender fliud??,2,NOT
wow i officially hate you lol,3,NOT
just because you dress up as a male from a musical does not make you transgender also i wouldn't refer to anything or anyone as girly because that's not really the correct term i'd say feminine and yes trisha is very feminine and presents feminine identifying with males is a totally different thing identifying as a male is a whole nother thing my question is if you are an adult now and can do what you want then why are you not attempting to somewhat pass another thing is because you are a straight female you are going to be attracted to gay dudes because you are straight that does not make you trans because they're gay you have to have this thing called gender dysphoria something that all trans people have and you wouldn't definitely not even want to mention your chest if you actually had it because it's a very overwhelming topic for transgender people i should now because i am trans and also your gender identity and sexuality is not a choice just like the natural color of your eyes and skin you didn't choose that.,3,NOT
please say i'm not the only one that is confused afüòÇüòÇ,2,NOT
i legit lost all my braincells-,3,NOT

i love you trisha but wtf you sound crazy af jason dodged a bullet with this one.,5,ABU
what is this!,2,NOT
i predict this video to go viral offend everyone because it's 019 every views seeking commentator will make a video on it then she'll delete it i know internet too damn well,3,NOT
this video just exposes how dumb trisha is... like emotionally and intellectually.. oh my god.,5,ABU
hey trisha i support you and will be by your side people shouldn't get mad at you just because your confused i understand how it feels to be lost look i honestly feel like the only gay guy who's on your side what i realized about these gays that get offended they act like they're going through way more just because they get offended easily well i'm sorry they can't understand you for you i'm sorry they make thousands of sexuality's just to make gay go viral sorry our world fucked you up in so many ways you can't even find yourself i know how that feels trisha i'm on your side and im gay so what are they gonna do about it ,1,NOT
shes trying to be deep but shes as deep as a puddle,3,NOT
ummmm no you're basically saying that not wanting to put on makeup and not wanting to do your hair in the morning means you're a boy and you're transgender... you don't like the association with being a female because with being a female comes with all the standards and expectations that media has put upon us you don't like how you feel when you don't meet those hypothetical standards and people make comments and because men don't have that same problem as women you're trying to say you're a man i'm so sorry but that's not how it works at all,3,NOT
girl what the fuck,3,NOT
maybe try a pixie cut with your real hair if you felt confident with that short wig.,1,NOT
you are very brave for sharing this it may not make sense to a lot but you make tons of sense girlüíñüíñ you are very aware of the fine details in your emotions love you so much girl.,1,NOT
so non-bianry or gender fluid?,2,NOT
from what trisha is describing i would say that she is actually gender fluid,2,NOT
to be honest videos like this is are why no one takes the lgbtq community seriously how can we expect people to not make fun of us when theirs people like trisha who use serious topics such as being transgender as a way to get more views and publicity this honestly disgusts me im sorry,3,NOT

i love animals i have kept many animals as pets during my life dogs cats canaries parrots fish everything you can think of but going vegan is also killing animals indirectly what do you think will happen to the domestic animal breeds such as sheep cows chicken and to a lesser extent pigs and goats i am not judging you or saying that you are wrong for not eating meat it's your choice i am just stating facts the current way of keeping domestic animals is cruel and it should be changed but eliminating meat from the diet of people is not the answer people don't eat dogs yet dogs suffer much more than farm animals to see what i am talking about i will give you an example i am mostly a catch and release fisherman but also i keep some fish you might say it's cruel but i am contributing for the fish population much more than you who aren't fishing or eating fish i pay a daily fee which is not cheap to fish.the law is that most of that money goes to fish stocking which means that thousands of fish are bred and released every year because of me and people like me so who is the real contributor to the wild waters here? me or you fish that is the daily limit on trout fishing are humanely killed to feed me and hundreds are released due to me.,2,NOT
thank you for this documentary,1,NOT
i never eat meat in my life i was vegetarian now i am vegan,1,NOT
ik this is a vegan topic based video but you have to think of overpopulation and how to control it so instead of abused mass produced farm raised animals people who choose to eat meat could hunt for what they and their families consume it's way better than all the wasteful ways of the meat production and it's low in cruelly because the animals would develop in nature this would be hunting for survival purposes not trophy hunting,1,NOT

the main focus should be around peoples health everyone wants to be healthy on the other hand the majority of people don't care about the environment when they eat bottom line most people are selfish and don't give a @% about anyone or anything that is not related to them process vegan food is not health promoting and being vegan is not the answer to optimal health whole foods free of chemicals and minimally process are the key most restaurants and chefs are all about how to deliver chemicals throughout food if you want to eat rice boiled it in water and eat it stop falling into the artificial stimulation produced by the saturation and processing of food throughout added chemicals we are not carnivores neither omnivores otherwise meat would be perfect and wouldn't cause any problem whatsoever the main objection of people to make a change in diet is the fear of missing the food they think they love but the reality is than they can't taste good food because they are saturated and their senses aren't sensible enough after a terrible diet our taste improves dramatically over time after adopting a health promoting diet free of salty animal products sugar and oil find a way to demonstrate to people that they will not only be healthier but they will enjoy food like never before and realize that is nothing like sitting on the couch watching tv with the mind empty healthy people are more energetic and enthusiastic about food and that shows that is not the end of your happiness it's the beginning!!!!,2,NOT

i have to say that as a video i think the this one isn't as good as the 01 and 01 videos not sure why could have just been my own state of mind or something but i feel like it was lacking something and was maybe a bit lacklustre somehow despite that this is still such a moving and inspirational review of the progress that has happened and i am still very happy about it 3,2,NOT
i have been vegan for only month and i am confused where the hell i was before? best decision ever !!!,1,NOT
very good film eating crispy fried chicken while watching this.,2,NOT
i have been vegan since 01 and definitely not going back to meat veganism is not just a trend is a lifestyle that benefits you and the planet in so many ways just by standing for our animals and our planet.,1,NOT

this sort of video is exactly what people need vegans rallying together and being happy that they're making positive changes for themselves animals and the environment even if it isn't perfect sometimes people make mistakes) instead of having that horrible elitist mentality and bullying other vegans for not being vegan enough lets face it we see way too much of the later and it harms the movement rather than helping it.,1,NOT
and may god save our planet and those with morals who live a plant based lifestyle... because nothing will save those who take part in animal cruelty and consumption.,2,NOT

1:0 wait so we need to feel sorry for women making 00k and we all know that there is an effort gap between the genders men tend to work more hours sacrifice more personal time to climb that ladder there is nothing stopping women from doing this and some women do and they are very rich but most women don't want to put in the effort.,3,NOT
i want to know why both genders are making 100k one year out of school that is absurd.,2,NOT

there were results from some other physical locations that showed women earned more than men i don't know,2,NOT
good job vox the video is both factually correct and proposes the solutions to solve the gender gap that exists in the same profession on the same position this an intellectually honest and interesting video the problem is that it will not solve the infamous  cents to a dollar since women will still be more likely to take part time job or be home stay mother and against what feminists say it is valid and respected choice) so this 9/10 should be dropped all together.,1,NOT
it makes sense if women want to get paid as much as men they should do a good of job if they do and are discriminatated because of having children then it's the companies fault.,2,NOT
most people miss the fact that its all fake,3,NOT
"your intonation sucks,you are very annoying!",3,NOT
ooooooooooooor your boss might pay you by your skills and efficiency and not what you have under your pants i mean just maybe?,3,NOT

what people miss about the gender wage gap is that there isn't any this gender gap myth doesn't take into effect hours worked type of job full time part time also the fact that women don't particular do the same jobs as men and if they do they don't work as long as men do women like nurturing and office roles that are best suited for them you know jobs that are not particularly dangerous no women out there are gonna break their back doing a real man job like construction just ask any sensible women and if they say they do they're lying simple as that,3,NOT
equal pay act of 963 look it up,2,NOT
did vox read the study they posted in their description the study states that 4 of the wage gap of mba's is a result of differences in mba courses taken and gpa differences in career interpretations and weekly hours worked that reduces the wage game to 5% a direct quote from the study fifteen years after obtaining their ba women who earned an mba had the lowest labor force participate rate the lowest share working full time and full year and took the greatest amount of non-educational time off from employment compared with others having professional degrees and phd's vox if you want to discuss the wage gap and present your view on it then at least reference a source that supports your view and not one that opposes it.,2,NOT
im confused why people comment refuting the gap when the video confronts most of the arguments people use to disprove its existence that study of those graduates from business schools makes it seem pretty concrete that for one reason wemon typically working less hours due to social pressures that make them more likely to handle the bulk of child rearing or another out right discrimination it exists.,1,NOT
glad she didn't say patriarchy once,1,NOT
age gap doesn't exist it's hours and choice of jobs just because overall and collectively gatherd woman are getting less money than men because...well it's simple more men are in higher paying job also it's illegal to have a pay gap it's simple,3,NOT
why focus on the jobs and not the lack of male parenting?,2,NOT
you know you can dislike it without watching the video yet if its vox,3,NOT
i would be very interested to see a study of the correlation between assertiveness and aggressiveness with income the more driven and assertive and confident you are the higher your income seems likely to be assertiveness and aggressiveness are linked to testosterone men have demonstrably higher testosterone levels i think the wage gap is as simple as biology.,2,NOT
the wage gap is a lie stop lying  it's been illegal to pay women less since the 0s in america see equal pay act of 963  comparing someone that works housekeeping or in a call center to a banker or ceo is intellectually dishonest  any earnings gap is due to hours worked someone who works only  hours a week will always take home less than someone who works 0 hours a week amount of years with employers who give annual raises also effect earnings in companies that don't automatically give yearly raises and where a person has to ask for a raise if you don't ask you only have yourself to blame for not getting a raise  businesses are in it to make money if the wage gap was real the bottom line would argue that only hiring women would be in the businesses best interest.,3,NOT
do we need to shrink it?,2,NOT
the reason women often bear the responsibility of raising children is because they are better at it also why is it that nowadays stay at home mom's are looked down upon it's a hard job no doubt but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the traditional family structure where the man works and the woman takes care the kids for goodness sakes people it works better that way in most cases!,2,NOT
thats funny she didnt go over any of the occupations where women earn more than men like modeling waitressing stripping hooking.....,2,NOT
the wage gap is a myth,3,NOT
after watching this feministic preach imma go watch some f** me like you hate me on ph wish me good luck.,3,NOT
this on the right path by looking in to specific data that goes into the grossly misleading wage gap but even this draws ways too easy and broad conclusions there needs to be flexibility to account for the variety of working decisions woman make throughout their career the main focus should be on educating girls that they should be excited for any job that catches their eye like how nurses are still a taboo job for men) we have to get girls visualising themselves succeeding in male dominated roles elsewhere we should all be sharing info on our income to help all us in negotiating better salaries this should help disclose any lingering gender pay inequities as for the family that's up to the family to figure out if they want to have kids and this vid is promoting sexism by saying just mums have to work around their kids if that's how it is in your family that's your choice at the very least thats a social cultural issue not a pay work issue.,2,NOT
if you take all of the money earned by women and compare it to all of the money earned by men you will arrive at the conclusion that women earn 77 of the money that men earn once you factor in for educational choices women tend to choose socially oriented fields while men still overwhelmingly make up those who choose stem fields career investment women tend to time more time away from their career to raise families and time spent working men tend to work more overtime than women do that gap narrows to nil want to make a ton of money choose a stem degree work  hours a week for 0-4 years and never get pregnant.,2,NOT
when women can force men into or out of fatherhood without any ability on the part of the man who will be saddled with alimony even if he never wanted a kid it makes sense they'd have to take care of it more more rights more responsibility,3,NOT
‚Äúwhat people miss about the gender wage gap‚Äù nothing.,2,NOT
o so now its the jobs women work at and the way they choose to work i thought it was misogyny and patriarchy ,3,NOT
perhaps the answer isn't so much more flexible hours but rather that men be more involved in their children's lives.,1,NOT
they also miss that in the military men perform more work for equal pay work equals amount of push-ups and setups performed and run times on pt test in this example specifically,3,NOT

"talking about the gender wage gap is besides the point because even the concept equal pay for equal work"" built into law violates legal rights that are owed to a person and constitutes a due process violation namely if i due to my personal preferences want to give more of my own money to a man than to a woman that is my personal choice it's my money and i have the right to do what i want with it if i prefer working with men more then with women and thus pay a man more than a woman for equal work no one has the right to intervene and tell me how to manage my own money it is my money but the government does it forces me to pay them equally it forces me to give my own money to someone although i entered no legally-binding relationship with that person but is all based on the ideological concept of equality' given the fact that lawmaker's ideological concept be it equality or whatever cannot trump legal rights that are owed to a person basing the laws on the concept equal pay for equal work is a due process violation.",3,NOT

wage-gap statistics is what you get when you are a horrible scientist and don't know how to control for factors.,3,NOT
here's the answer to your bullshit wage gap women have jobs that are not as hard to complete as what men will do they do the easy jobs then expect to get paid like a man working construction when have you ever seen a woman working on the job site laying bricks or shoveling dirt at a construction job never that's just an example it goes for more then just construction like my example was,3,NOT
number one thing people miss about the gender wage gap simple it's not real.,3,NOT
all these intelligent economists and they never come out and discuss these things don't they realize their opinion is highly valued why do i only see milo a troll albeit has facts but not an economist argue with dumb feminists i want to see a debate with a phd economist saying there is sexism vs no i probably won't understand most of it but it would be interesting there might not be any economists to even debate one side but that's the thing i don't know their opinions on it so i wouldn't know!,3,NOT
yea the people miss that it doesnt exist,3,NOT
we know the wage gap is mostly due to women's choices.,2,NOT
men need to step up and do more housework and child care so the work is split equally between men and women if that happened the wage gap would be much improved.,1,NOT
you know if its a wage gap then why are the hours people work the defining factor is that not rather an earnings gap?,1,NOT

the gender wage gap is a myth,3,NOT
or!!!...or!...or we could start training young men and boys to start picking up their share of the child care and chores why does it have to be the woman's job if men are equal to women then they need to man up and start acting like half their dna is in this child if men were able to say rearrange their tues and thurs schedules to make sure they were the ones to pick up the kids from school and take them to soccer practice and make dinner then the woman would only have to rearrange mon wed fri not to mention that if men were also held responsible for 0 of the care then businesses would have to start having more family friendly programs and hours because both fathers and mothers around 0 of the work force would be working around their babies just a thought.,1,NOT
another thing is men are more likely to ask for raises or promotions than women so even if the man and the woman are doing the exact same work with the exact same hours and are both deserving of a raise a smart employer isn't going to just hand it out unless they ask for a wage or risk losing a valued employee,1,NOT
"i think we can all agree that this is not as simple as companies don't pay women as much as men"" and i think we can all agree that if a company is intentionally discriminating against women something should be done about it but i think that is much more on an individual case-by-case basis who cares about making the average full time salaries closer to each other that statistic means nothing as this video shows...",1,NOT
so why should we want to shrink it if it is caused by a choice in priorities why not just leave women free to make that choice so long as there aware the consequence will be lower average pay?,2,NOT
so the video is stating that we should go against nature and force farhers to share equal work of care of the child?,2,NOT
none of this is relevant outside the usa,2,NOT
wait the graph at :1 is badly interpreted could be interpreted as more it contributes for the pay gap but it doesn't mean that an individual woman make less just about how many women to men work in that job it is important as these fields are the best paid fields so the less women in this field in average women make less.,2,NOT

this issue will never resolve it self family life would have to reshape and women would have to see their time with children or their selves reduce to even out the numbers with men working full or part time women would have to value their time at work as much or more so than their social or family existence and firefighter is never going to be a flexible job for someone who isn't invested fully in it lots of things will never likely bend that much to an employee's needs.,2,NOT

i think we should all keep in mind that it's also more difficult for women to get into higher paid jobs than it is for men not necessarily for lack of willingness though fewer women seek out certain jobs than men but from labour work to high-paid management positions males are more likely to be chosen by employers out of an equal pool of prospective employees and even sometimes when a woman has greater qualifications it's a similar problem to how fewer african-americans gain employment even when race ratio and education is equal across candidates i don't know if it's just something society will grow out of or if something needs to be done to break the cycle of unequal opportunity/unequal selection here in australia it's not too bad given that state education is easily accessible and puts most kids on equal footing as far as modern education goes but still countless indigenous families can't get their kids the same opportunities because its so much harder for them to get a job due to discrimination there's still a widespread perception of aboriginals as welfare leeches and drug addicts that prevents them from finding work) and in turn their children end up in a similar situation being unable to provide equal opportunity to their own families my point is it's not always choice that creates earnings gaps between different demographics as much as we like to think our freedom-loving first-world countries provide equally abundant opportunities for everyone i just think we need to be mindful of that.,2,NOT

what people don't see is that its complete bullshit,3,NOT
good analysis but i don't like how making work hours more flexible is presented as the only solution the problem clearly lies within the social realm of men not feeling themselves as responsible for raising children and doing housekeeping stuff sure you can fight an issue on places different then the core but the main source of the problem is what really needs to be addressed in our society i believe.,1,NOT

if women don't have kids they will be free from the wage gap especially since they can sue companies for the difference the problem begins when feminism opens the barriers to motherhood and the workforce many women consider it normal to work and have kids yet end up with the burden they may get help from their spouse parents or a caretaker but feel the need to bond with their child even if they are entirely free from their chores etc many women end up being stay at home mothers feminism says there's nothing wrong with it and that it should be a paid job the many ways feminism turn women into womb when they can simply be child free.,3,NOT

there is a wage gap in between everyone.. the reason there is a gap is because everyone has different performances different shifts and different attendances.... you can't be making the exact same amount of money as your coworker.. if equal pay was actually a thing people that have bad performances are going to be paid as much as a person that has good performance would get... and i'm not necessarily saying that women have worse performance than men one more thing... i know a couple that worked in the same workplace different shifts but were the same hours and in the same department the lady makes about 00 more than her spouse and i guess it's because he doesn't get things done sooooo... yeah...,3,NOT

mostly a good video it's a shame the wage gap is often presented as evidence of misogyny if this weren't the case i suspect many more people would be on board in finding solutions like more flexible hours or encouraging men to take a more active role in child care and other household duties we also need to make custody more equitable that would make men likely to take a more active role in their children's lives.,1,NOT
the main thing people miss about the pay gap is that it doesn't really exist there are laws preventing discriminatory pay what the  cents to the dollar myth comes from is a broad brush evaluation of what all men earn vs what all women earn apples to oranges when you actually factor in things like hours worked education and experience and the same career the wage gap disappears.,2,NOT

 things cause a gap in wages choice analytics and apathy the first of the main issues with choice of field of work was highlighted and dramatically reduced the gap‚Äù secondly males by nature are neither the most emotional or caring of our race for this reason males make a great choice for doing rolls that are terrible eg garbage man trauma cleaner plummers etc and even in the same field compare a contracts or criminal lawyer against a family or immigration lawyer and there will be a higher number of males in the worse areas further because of the lack of emotional it makes the able to make decisions based on an analytical process rather than personal feelings at the same time these traits are terrible for someone that works in other roles such as child care nursing etc but that's not to say either side of our race is any better than the other it just means that different people are suited or enjoy different roles further not all males or females follow the inherent typical male or female ways of thinking which is solely why we do see male in roles that females enjoy and vice versa in actuality it's not actually a problem not only because most people are married at some point and share their income or though logically we might actually want to enforce a pay gap for married men to be payed more to give mothers the option of being able to spend more bonding time with their children because children aren't a burden they are something special to love and care for.,5,ABU

this comment section is appalling i'm assuming everyone here is high school educated wage gap men work have higher paying jobs work longer hours etc remember what the equal sign means everyone the wage gap is the fact that men work higher paying jobs work longer hours etc yes there's still straight up discrimination that goes down but that's not the point we have a society and economy that accommodates men more so than women simply because women have kids take on more unpaid responsibilities associated with kids etc women are accommodated less in our economy solely due to the fact they are women and biologically have burdens that men do not birthing children) this is a systemic issue not an individual issue ___ like the video clearly stated a good first step is to make hours more flexible in positions and make paid maternity leave federally legal and required for all women this way women can work longer hours higher payer jobs etc and close the wage gap the amount of misinterpretation in these comments is appalling this is why trump is president americans are dumb ___-,2,NOT

"men and women make different choices women in the us do not all work and even if they worked women chose less paying jobs while men majoritaly make choices to work in businesses and ceos and take a whole different route than women bref women are more likely to work worst paying jobs while men work best paying this is factually correct vox doesn't know what is called facts"" the statistics of 7 cents to every dollar a man make doesn't account for each sex choses to work the sexes are different brain difference and social attitudes and now choices in life if you account for that the gap narrows to the point of vanishing edit this is a brief summary of tge response now about the topic or most of it of the video they don't account for most of these things  men work more hours than women because of that men are more paid than women this is not sexist this is common sense when someone work more that person get more paid men work more so they get more paid men often do the dirty work such cleaning  women often leave their jobs for maternity the statistics shows that they get paid less well did they account for the losing of jobs for mother purposes it is very factual that women leave their jobs raising kids more than men do for their children and even if they stayed as i said women work less hours after entering motherhood  in this video they talked about businesses and tech amd one more thing well these fields are dominated by men men are the majority of these fields women are not in fact out of the worst paying jobs in the us out of them are dominated by women while the other are men while out of the best paying jobs in the us out of them are majoritaly men and the other is women that statistics reflect the choices women and men do but wait does that proves sexism in the work place no that is because women dominate biology and medicine and single women are paid more than their male courter part however married women are paid less because they work less hours and even leave their jobs while men work more hours therefore are paid more they do the dirty jobs such cleaning the sewage and suffer from suicide overwhelmingly and in work men die more than women die in work.",2,NOT

my hourly wage is less than my supervisor i however have probably earned more money total than my supervisor since i stated this job  months ago is that somehow descriminate against my supervisor no that's my supervisor and myself being given the option to earn alot of over-time if we were willing to work the hours my supervisor chose to skip the extra hours except for when he absolutely had to work i however went months straight of going to work every single day and then getting off days only sparringly and that's when they force me to take off my supervisor gets every weekend off but if you looked at only the end result of total money earned you'd ask why is the supervisor earning less than someone positioned under them? people who believe the wage gap idiocy will claim the supervisor is somehow being descriminated against when in reality as with the wage gap idiocy it's because of our different choices.,2,NOT

while this definitely seems ever so slightly pro wage gap i do have to commend vox for approaching this issue very factually i think i may have to re-subscribe.,1,NOT
so the wage gap has nothing to do with inequality interesting thx vox.,2,NOT
i wish they made it clear in the video that this pertains to white women,1,NOT
doesn't seem like a wage gap at all the way it was explained it's appropriate pay for time in different sectors.,1,NOT
you also forgot that they don't work as hard they work less hours and take longer vacations wether or not they had kids.,5,ABU
there is no gender wage gap,2,NOT
lol based off of many comments people did not watch the video.,1,NOT
vox doesn't understand the difference between wages and earnings,2,NOT
great video that shows that the causes are part of the system and social structure and not just an arbitrary pay gap,1,NOT

always funny your propaganda,3,NOT
glad to see a left channel acknowledging that the wage gap is a choice by women through the careers they work and their choice to have children rather then systemic sexism where employers intentionally pay women less‚Äù which believe it or not a lot of leftists and sjws believe.,1,NOT
the only thing that i learned from this video is that scientists work self directed and i want to become one know!,1,NOT

"""we just need to make men take on lower paying jobs and women take on higher paying jobs so then we can all be the same and collectively earn the same amount because otherwise it's sexism"" vox.",3,NOT
the wage gap is not real,2,NOT
the beeping is going to give me an aneurism,2,NOT
you are operating on a faulty premise that men and women are the same if you accept we're not it all starts to make sense women make different choices than men on average choices have opportunity costs a choice to prioritize family is a commendable one and naturally implies the de-prioritization of career think about it.,2,NOT
the wage gap is not a thing its simply comparing the average earnings of all women to the average earnings of all men it doesnt take into account hours worked over time holiday pay time taken off different jobs job positions it is not about gender it is not sexist,2,NOT
 business depends on the company and the economy if i work for a small business i will be paid less than a corporation there is the equal pay act of 96 or 4 i always get the years mixed up so you can sue women usually work with jobs that are more for emotional reasons and a good chunk of them pay less than jobs like engineering don't forget that part time jobs do pay less i'm just saying look at these things before saying there is a pay gap.,2,NOT
so basically the wage gap is real but only because our society still hasn't figured out that women's purpose isn't to care for the kids,2,NOT
milo was right all along...,1,NOT
a very nice and well put together video with a lot of great data there is just one problem all of it is about earnings not necesserily wage as a matter of fact it is illegal to discriminate on gender for the exact same job equal pay act 963 wether a difference in earnings is something that has to be corrected is therefore debatable i bet you could make a very similar chart for iq and get a difference in earnings not saying women are dumber then men that wouldn't be based on an outward characteristic the problem i encounter here is the idea that the desired goal is to have an equal pay across the bord regardless of extra hours worked negotiations in wage or sick days etc there are a lot of variables that strifing for equality of outcome as equalizing earnings would be becomes a case of holding back people that want and can do more in a sense it is opressing them by not allowing them to choose to excell wether man or woman doesn't really matter to me quotas and wage redistribution are not solutions.,2,NOT
this entire argument is based on an equation that makes no sense i mean all full time workers in the us and you already stated that men go for the higher paying jobs and women favor lower ones that's like me setting up this bullshit with the guys and girls at my office then shockingly the girls make more because the owner is a women try getting data from people in the same field with the same level of experience and then we'll talk.,3,NOT
there aren't as many female billionaires right so that also counts to the statistic,1,NOT
does vox know the difference between earning and making i smell liberal arts degrees and spoiled middle class income brats,3,NOT
omg a woman is presenting the argument...therefore she's a traitor to women cuz apparently all women must share the same opinion.... sarcasm,2,NOT
well it's vox ladies and gentlemen why would i expected trash journalism at it finest!!,3,NOT
women choose to make less money than men then women choose to complain about their choices then they choose to argue that it is not their fault that they voluntarily made choices that they understood women that argue that this exists actually just think that men are superior and that women need special treatment.,5,ABU
congrats you just lost a subscriber,2,NOT
i like how there was an assumption that the flexible hours issue was all because of a child don't mind the fact that more childless women still prefer to work a more standard time schedule than childless men or men with children..... yeah also there is an absolute crap ton of other reasons for the earnings gap.,3,NOT
there are so many factors that are not included for example how many woman were followed and how many man more woman means more chance a woman will land a high paying job that raises the average.,2,NOT
"i did like this but i would also add that most mothers naturally have a strong bound with their children witch will lead most women to take more time off of work instead of the man that normally doesn't have a strong of a bound as the mother dose this normally stems from well...i women gives birth and carry's the child for months some women breast feed witch create a vary strong bound a bound that a father can't grow with his child and it can even take a new father a few weeks to even a few months to really feel like a father it just takes men more time its just nature there's a reason why people say women should stay home with the kids and men should go out this tradition has been around sense forever the mother's stayed home kept the kids happy and safe while the father went out and got food"" times have changed so women should have choice to work or not to üòä",2,NOT

"wow a video that states more,of the facts",1,NOT
everyone in the comments who is blindly saying that the wage gap is a lie is a moron it exists it is just far smaller than the .79- ratio that is usually shown and is closer to .92-0.98 this amount albeit much smaller has been entirely credited to workplace sexism by experts.,3,NOT
my parents each worked and each got a great and equal pension my father died years ago my mother is still collecting his and her pension wage gap?,2,NOT
why we should fight for just women rights?! and not for men and women? where are my rights as a man i lost my rights this is so inequality!! we as humans should fight for human rights not a certain gender!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2,NOT
there is nothing wrong with traditional gender roles where the husband is responsible for providing and the wife is responsible for caring millennia of history and simple biology tells us that is a strong and efficient default family structure that has kept our species alive this long if that's what a couple wants that shouldn't be a topic for a feminist's protest sign just because raising children doesn't get you a paycheck money is not the most important thing in the world even though many people think so on the flip side i do also believe that if both husband and wife want to break from tradition/biology and are both providing then both husband and wife should be caring as well it's all about a balance and the on each side is not what it's all about it's about a happy and functioning home with what the people inside that home consider an egalitarian division of responsibilities regardless of a wage gap. people would do well to establish this before deciding to marry and/or have kids so they don't just let life happen to them and become unhappy in their home and channel their discontent into an internal hatred of whatever system or movement they think is keeping them down smart choices planning your life and personal responsibility will do wonders.,1,NOT
you guys are bad and you should feel bad.,3,NOT
it's the opposite now.,2,NOT
so basically one of the main reasons for the pay gap is because women take care of the kids what a twist there are also other factors that greatly inflate the most commonly sighted statistic i also noticed that the graph showing wage gap distribution between different types of occupations ranges from . and 0.5 while this video is pretty biased it's at least well researched and has some useful information so long as you take it with a grain of salt just be aware that they only covered a small part of the problem and said problem tends to be greatly exaggerated and now i realize that this video came out years ago and i'm probably gonna be blasted from both sides of the argument if this comment section is still active.,2,NOT
this video is intentionally being intellectually dishonest......,3,NOT
(sorry my english i have never ever in my life got paid more than my female co workers who has the same seniority level and same kind of work the only time i have got more salary than some others is because i have worked more overtime but the same goes to as women as well i am so sick and tired of man hating feminists or feminists in general who always have to claim obscure things.,3,NOT
i own a business and have men and women working for me women have beautiful work ethic much better work ethic than men but when it comes to physical tasks in our place i find men usually can work harder for longer periods of time but not always true but i believe that's why men are paid more though there's a higher demand for male employees i have better success in my business hiring males over female but we do a lot of physical labor i hire women for jobs in my business that i need people to be more trustworthy and meticulous however.,2,NOT
ok the wage gap does exist but not because of inequality it exists because women tend to not work as much as men do either due to children or by choice.,2,NOT
gender war in the comments warning scroll down if you dare,2,NOT
yeah maternity leave and overtime affect a lot maybe if you used better data...but nah google found the wage gap affected men negativley and they had to give raises.,2,NOT
it is not a wage gap it is an earnings gap.,1,NOT
there's a difference between wage and earnings you know,1,NOT
why don't men take care of the children?,1,NOT
how are there so many dislikes when the comment section seems to be in agreement,1,NOT

i'm just glad the word patriarchy wasn't used so i listen and she's got some pretty valid points i think.,1,NOT
"the wage gap itself completely wrong.because it doesn't exist the study was conducted by looking at the the wage of women and the average amount they earn a month compared to a man but they didn't take in many factors like bonuses,hours off,positions of jobs,ect also on average women take more time off it's a commonly studied statistic used to prove the wage gap wrong men work more hours and take more overtime than women on average women take more time off and the wage gap itself is illegal.",2,NOT

asian wage gap is so bad white people make less than them wtf man white supremecy back in action we need to take our country back from the asians,5,ABU
how about we end all affirmative acton so employers know that they are getting the real deal and not a dunce who got a leg up then let's begin a huge public shaming campaign for women who fail to earn enough maybe we can tattoo deadbeat or loser across their forehead let's have a media campaign talking about how a woman who can't support kids and a husband without him having to work isn't a real woman. let's saddle women with all the responsibility for supporting the family or face being branded losers not worthy of life let's make it so a woman has to earn a certain amount to qualify for any consideration at all for romance yep let's reduce the entire worth of women to their paycheck then let's see if that old pay gap doesn't vanish faster than a candy bar at a fat camp.,6,ABU
you dumb feminists need to learn this if women are paid less than men why are companies not hiring women then and saving money on salaries it would only make sense right why would an employer purposefully want to pay more to a guy when they can a woman to do the same job for less this is capitalism folks and your fukin tricks on how the wage gaps are a sexism thing is actually nuts,5,ABU

she also forgot different educations what school they went to grades from that school along with which degree and that there are more men in specific higher paying fields s.t.e.m fields to be more specific so the 7-7 cents yo the dollar become  cents to the dollar and there are more variables that can be taken into account that just aren't one being kids income and how many women who don't work and how many men don't work which can put it in the range of being cents to the exact same payment in all honesty if there is a sexism variable in here it's minute and insignificant because there is a law against it.,2,NOT
shame you missed the factors that were not taken into account in this study namingly location of the job think the dif between new york and alabama) choice of job they followed mba graduates for the study cited but an exec at a bank will make more than an exec at a company with stores) hours worked per week in thomas sowells study which took these into account the pay gap between men and women was at most cents on the dollar with the female working less hours per pay cycle additionally in most jobs where a woman was unmarried and had no kids she tended to outearn an unmarried no kids male by a large margin by years post graduation.,2,NOT

it's not a wage gap it's an earnings gap,2,NOT
i like how women born in the mid 940's had close to earning parity with men maybe that had something to do with all the men being killed in some sort of war or something.,2,NOT
in soviet union we didn't have this problem called rising intonation...,2,NOT
the wage gap doesn't exist unfortunately for all of you feminists who just want to get paid more than they do without actually earning it,3,NOT
well if women worked harder and worked to their full potential then they would earn more,3,NOT
so the video says what everyone knows men are more willing to take on higher risk longer hours graveyard overtime and spend more time with their job for higher pay women are more likely to take on part time easier hours and a more limited job scope we get it there's no such thing as a wage gap that's just misinformation about individual preferences.,3,NOT
vox the reasonable arguement didn't get their facts from biased sites buzzfeed the crazy feminist that did no research got facts from biased websites not so reasonable.,2,NOT
woman most often choose to take care of their children woman also work less hours in total then men plus you know it's illigel to pay employees less due to gender look it up site some sources grow up there are real problems like the famine in africa e.t.c,3,NOT
‚Äúthe wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full-time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination.‚Äù,1,NOT

the biggest thing that no one has mentioned is the fair pay act of 3 it is illegal to pay some one less for the same job my question is why there are not lawsuits for breaking the law oh because only like 0 have been filed so far and more than half of those were found not true.,2,NOT
shouldn't the conclusion of this be maybe women shouldn't be expected to earn the same as a man while also having to shoulder the majority of the burden at home maybe men take on more domestic responsibility or accept that they may have to provide more financially if they expect their wife to run the home and raise the kids.,2,NOT
so what's the solution to this problem my liberal comrades use government power to force men to stay at home and take care of the kids more or force employers to change schedules so we can fit them around women's needs or better yet both!,2,NOT
take note women men aren't worth a fart,3,NOT
i cant believe fox posted the truth for once!,2,NOT
despite saying all this in the video i'm still viewed as sexist when i shoot down 0 of the pointd feminists try to use and fully supported the other 0 and to tell them things aren't as bad as you are trying to say it is even though there is things that need to change still stuff like this is why i stopped supporting feminism.,3,NOT

there is no freaking wage gap u are so dumb oml,3,NOT
there are two sides to it the gap on different fields is what people look at but women tend to go into lower paying jobs to begin with but then there is the argument that if a man and a women are doing the exact same job and let's say they started on the exact same day and can work the exact same amount of hours the man still seems to make more over all,1,NOT
what people miss is there's the fact that it doesn't exist.,2,NOT
so your pretty much saying the wage gap exists becuse females tend to be less flexible becuse they have to take care of the family more often,2,NOT
so in a nutshell it's not sexism,1,NOT
"come on you want to get rid of schedules just so that wives can be worked to death easier why can't we just work to create an environment where women don't feel like they have to be a slave to their husbands there's no reason they should take the majority of the work raising children unless they want to that is but still i don't like the idea of saying oh you want to work two jobs give up on all your dreams slave away in the kitchen while your husband and children watch tv okay then let's help you make that possible"".",1,NOT
there is no gap.. if you consider habits hours education experience... take a men and a women that have everything above the same they earn the same money for the same job.. why did you hide that in this video?,2,NOT

female tennis players earn the same in major tournaments for less work.,2,NOT
imagine earning 60.00 dollars and still complain that u earn less than men,2,NOT
the problem is that in the current american culture we keep wage/salary a secret somehow thinking that it's shameful or private or something and putting a huge taboo on revealing what we are paid to our coworkers when i worked a job that gave me access to payroll data i was shocked how much salaries varied between people doing exactly the same job who had identical experience and tenure when there are many jobs like that then the statistics become hard to extract the gender wage gap from the overall inexplicable wage disparities if every company published how much it paid each employee then we could figure out the breadth and depth of the gap.,1,NOT
my dad makes more than my mom doing the same engineering job they always meet the minimum production rate they don't grade production unless d or f which neither has gotten my mom hasn't taken maternal leave my dad i think yes he had to my sister to and from school even sporting events while my mom never went unless in the car with him hours don't matter as long as you are close to  or met  hours she's not going to complain when she loves her jobs and has multiple friends.,2,NOT
its a myth if girls were truly paid less buisnesses would hire only women bc they would have to pay less,2,NOT
literally just listen to the first  seconds of this video,2,NOT
i find it interesting how this video could also tie in with the lack of paid maternal and paternal leave women who take time off for a baby do not have to be paid leading to the wage gap yet someone has to bring in money so men are expected to work even if they want to stay with their child it's a bad situation all around.,1,NOT

and the comments are a war zone why am i not surprised what's interesting is that she's basically saying similar things that christina hoff sommers has said in a video i saw a while ago it's similar points but their conclusions are different this video has more stats and research if you all are getting upset about findings that academics have made cause of their research then i'm not really sure what to say to you.,1,NOT
tl:dr there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap meaning all men put together earn more than all women put together which is because men work higher paying jobs more dangerous jobs and more hours for the same exact work and same exact hours men and women are paid the same.,1,NOT
the thing is it doesn't exist woooaaahhh,2,NOT
what's also missed is that as men are progressing up the career ladder many of their female counterparts are taking time off work to have children no woman is going to be offered a raise then.,3,NOT
if the wage gap existed where men make say 0 an hour and women make 7 an hour then why not only hire women why pay men the extra  when you can save that by paying only women?,2,NOT

i took from that last seen.. a female lion tamer female ice cream taster and female writer should make the same as a male doctor.. seriously?,3,NOT

question.....if women get paid less then men wouldn't it be advantageous for a business to hire just women in order to save on operating costs ...,2,NOT
so what you're saying is that because of the disproportionate amount of women in lower paying fields and/or raising children working less or innumerable other circumstances that prevent them from working in higher wage employment or recieving bonuses or raises statiscally speaking the wage gap doesn't really exist.,2,NOT
it doesn't exist,2,NOT
huh i went to the most liberal biased news source i knew of and i'm impressed vox covered this very well and i don't feel as if it's biased.,2,NOT
she just explained why the wage gap doesn't exist,1,NOT
it has a lot to do with aspirations upbringing and education environment/location/'privelege' and even career choice... obviously an underwater welder who works a week welding under the ocean for full 12-1 hr day and living on site for a full week and going home for another two or what have you will make more than a chick who just goes and does nursing.. women tend to take far less risks especially when it comes to their lives knowingly/consciously anyhow) there are jobs that pay danger pay i can guarantee you will find a largely male workforce for said types of employment/career thank you vox for being reasonable and having some common sense....,1,NOT
the comments are filled ignorance smh,2,NOT
so basically it does not exist?,2,NOT
it's almost as if men and women have different preferences and are more inclined to make different life choices haha,2,NOT
you'll get paid as much if you do as good a job,2,NOT
"sorry 50,00 is not 6 percent less than 00,000 it is 0 of 00,000 or 0 less... obviously semantics but it changes the of the statistic pretty heavily.",1,NOT
you're so close vox i can see it in you you're so close to realizing that wage inequality is not a bad thing.,5,ABU
what i got from the video is that men need to actually start taking care of kids i mean 7 to % yeah the 7 left are equal but still that's pretty stingy considering you have a : chance of having things fair or having to do more work.,1,NOT
we also miss why there is sbout 0 reasons,1,NOT
women working aren't attractive at all sorry dried up cat ladies.,5,ABU
"the only word that needs to come after wage gap is myth"" vox is fake news.",3,NOT
moral of the story you can't have everything.,2,NOT
finally an intelligent video it get many things wrong and miss some things to consider but holy moly finally a feminist video that uses logic instead of feelings thank god vox keep it going,2,NOT
there are some rare fields that women earn more then men like construction but they also make up less than  of the workforce so like small victory mmmhhhh |,1,NOT
but does it matter,2,NOT
so according to the comments we either live in a perfect society where every single person is hardwired to treat everyone in the exact same respectful way or we live in a society where we have a male dominant entity that hates women and makes employers pay women less nevermind facts and details nope facts don't matter one side must be the unquestionable truth and research doesn't matter unless it contains a catchphrase that vaguely backs the agenda i support.,2,NOT
i think most people already knew this save radical feminists who think it's all about sexism and extreme sexist men who think there is no sexism,3,NOT

"is her accent normal i'm a foreigner so i can't tell but she sounds like a jimmy fallon impersonation of a teenage girl eew"" i probably misinterpret her intonation the content is very interesting and i find her viewpoint very interesting.. but i couldn't shake her accent)",3,NOT
look it is a dis-honest to demand for income equality between men and women women get maternity leaves when they're pregnant men don't so demanding to get paid for the time you don't work is not nice men are not hesitated to work long hours or even being asked to work long hours women can't work for long hours and they literally need not we live in a capitalist economic country where one earns as much as he works we don't live in a socialistic economy where what you earn is regardless of how much you work equal pay between sexes is not really practical.,3,NOT
an other solution ti close the gender pay gab could be by making more and better kindergardens and places you can bring your child when it is sick.,1,NOT
the wage gap does exist but it's not about women getting paid less it's about women choosing jobs that pay less than men do why do women choose lesser paying jobs it's not because they need more time to take care of their kids not every woman has a child it's because of the way women are raised if you walk into the girls toy section of a store it's filled with baby dolls and lots of other toys that are associated with taking care of children and things that are considered feminine other videos about the wage gap will point it out women go into pediactrics over brain surgery all the time i'm sure there's more but i'm not aware enough of the job market right now to know if this wasn't a sexist problem then women wouldn't be choosing lesser jobs than men in the first place.,1,NOT
the stat that said that women still did the majority of child care despite both parents being in full time jobs my initial thoughts were  how many hours overtime is the man doing  what are the couples professions is one say a receptionist and one is an industrial engineer it was not stated but elsewhere in the vid it shows that woman as a group earn less per year than a man so you can infer that the full time woman is still probably working less hours in a lower paid job than her husband that said both parents should take a more equal role in child rearing than still seems the case today.,1,NOT
what wasn't mentioned is that women are generally secondary earners for a family taking part-time jobs only to supplement the couple's gross earnings but that would have really pissed off the feminists...,2,NOT
the comment section is just as idiotic as you would assume.,3,NOT
so since men get more you should treat men bad oh i see now look who became bad pls i just wanna have equal the same,3,NOT
i wonder why people care what gender makes more or less at the end of the day male and females husband and wife bring the money back to the household and spend it together i mean seriously why do you woman think that we men work so hard we work hard to provide for our family and give them a better future if we only thought of ourselves trust me we would work days a week and party days,2,NOT
it aint real,2,NOT
ah a video about gender i expect the comment section to be very peaceful full of respect and unbiased.,2,NOT
its about averages can't you fools math?,3,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination.,2,NOT
i suspect a slight bias.,2,NOT
or men could do cooperate equally with their kids and their house,2,NOT
in order to conclude that the wage gap is a problem you have to start with the presupposition that  the only thing people care about is money and  women have no will of their own and are simply puppets subjected to the world men choose for them.,2,NOT
so it's not sexism.. really running out of issues there feminists.,2,NOT
this has been completely debunked it is a lie they dont want to go by hourly pay hourly pay the wage gap is insignificant!!! they have banned this question look it up!!!! a man works more hours!!!! the females want to get paid the same amount for less work!!! this is proven!!!!!,3,NOT
so womens get to spend time with there kids and make different decisions what's the problem?,2,NOT
"i have to say i'm happy to see a middle-left leaning formerly very left leaning outlet like vox talking about what the actual controlled numbers say about the earnings gap instead of just parroting the woefully inadequate statistic women only make 7 on the dollar to men"" way to be more objective and take a deeper dive for the truth then many others i've seen.",1,NOT
exactly if women can be paid with such a low salary then why not most companies hire women instead of men for certain jobs there are reasons for these wage gaps and it's not merely women are seen as being incompetent women are expected by society to dedicate their time for their family while men are expected to feed his family so men can spend more time on their jobs.,2,NOT
it's illegal to pay someone less because of their gender since 963,1,NOT
if they could pay women less just hire all women but they all get paid the same.,2,NOT
there will always be inequality there is no utopia.,2,NOT
if there was a wage gap we would simply only employ women.,2,NOT

except it really doesn't exist because if a man and a woman both work the exact same job have the same quality of work and the same hours they will get paid the same wage gap would only be a real problem if women were getting paid less for the exact same work that's just discrimination the wage gap only exists because of how they measure wage difference.,2,NOT
your conclusions do for logically follow from your argument that there is a wage gap.,2,NOT
i can't with the vocal fry i need it to stop i can't take people seriously if they sound like silly bimbos.,5,ABU
doesn't exist,2,NOT
if women get paid less then why aren't all companies hiring women nowadays?,2,NOT
there is no wage gap it is literally illegal to pay women less women make 7 cents for every dollar a man makes because there are less women working and less women working high-paying jobs statistically women are shown to be less likely to ask for raises than men women have equal rights there is no patriarchy holding you back 9 of people in america at least believe in equality for everyone go watch a video on the wage gap besides this one) it's been thoroughly debunked several times feminism is cancer.,3,NOT
as long as everyone has the opportunity i don't see any problem.,1,NOT

ahahahahaaaa this is so much fun ahahahaaaa,2,NOT
why do they always point to women doing the majority of child raising like men need to do halve that work to on top of the fact that they never say yes women do most of the child raising and that's because men still pay either though taxes/child support ect the majority of the cost of child raising.,2,NOT
the gender pay gap is a myth as proven by the video women desire a more balanved lifestyle more than men men are more likely to work more and harder therefore they get more pay also if your employer is paying you less than a man that's illegal so why don't we see millions of lawsuits every year for discrimination?,3,NOT
this also forgets to mention that there are far less women then men to get tech and engineering degrees and that is by choice of the individual women themselves you dont see a ton of men going into nursing because its not what a vast portion of men want to be doing women dominate nursing because a lot more of women value that field of work and lets face it some fields of work are more profitable then others.,2,NOT
why do women always try to compare themselves to what men achieve can you go somewhere else and invent your own standards?seriously....have your own business methodology no wonder why alot of women feel inferior in a sense don't try to be better than men or earn more than them or have any sort of measurement against them do your own thing be unique.,3,NOT
crush the patriarchy like you're crushing that puss,2,NOT
there is no such thing as a gender wage gap that would be highly illegal so stop trying to push the feminist narrative that has be debunked many times over.,2,NOT
the fact people who say that the wage gap actually exist disgust me if you are a company all you care about is profit then no men would ever work ever again because all companies would hire women because it's less of an expense it is also income not wage income is less because it is proven that women don't work as much as women and does not work as much overtime as men americans all live in a very very privileged life and the fact that you say women are less then men is just an excuse for their failures the fact that men have to pay more for car insurance is that definition of institutional sexism so don't say pink tax is a thing the fact that i have to go to the korean military to regain citizenship and a women doesn't is inequality.,3,NOT
"people claim that it's a myth and demand the statistics to back it up you give them the data and statistics to back it up and suddenly it's asinine arguments like oh it's really an earnings gap not a wage gap"" etc semantics i'm pretty sure we all understand the sentiment here the arguments presented in the video are still sound regardless of what you want to call the issue at hand and then there's the argument see it's a lifestyle choice because of work hours it has nothing to do with gender!"" cut the bullshit we all know women have historically been discouraged or forbidden from working in order to rear children and that this is still prevalent in our culture today it is a gender issue one that's so deeply permeated into our culture that people don't even recognize it because they choose to ignore the sociological/anthropological reasons as to why this is.",2,NOT

a gender wage gap isn't gender wage gap really,2,NOT
in order to close the gender pay gap make the total earnings of women the same as mens you'd have to stop women from having babies so being that the only set of countries where this lunacy is being pushed is western countries what's being advocated will result in the end of the white race not to mention laying the precedent for communist equality of outcome society so in short end of the white race and communism and the mainstream media is pushing this out in the west you should be asking who owns and controls the media and why would they want to bring about the end of the white race and introduce jewish invented communism?,5,ABU

scientists have flexible hours... are you insane.. most scientists work their asses off over hours they barely have time to do anything else.,2,NOT
so women get paid less because they take care of their children and do more housework and work for less hours for the same job than men ok so feminist myth debunked that for the same amount of time worked women get paid less its quality and quantity that matters to make money so money quality of work x quantity of time given hence even if quality of both genders remains same the quantity of time poured by women is less because of her maternal instincts which should not be booed by feminists i respect good mothers who pour in a lot of efforts in their job as well as to their kids men and women are simply just different if we try to make them look equal or make either gender be superior then its wrong proud egalitarian here ),3,NOT

the wage gap exists for more than just reasons jordan peterson speaks about how there are about 6-2 factors that contribute to the wage gap potentially some contribute more than others or perhaps not one of the factors is discrimination against women that women activists hate so much despite the factor being a mere  of the issue.,2,NOT
the only possible way to kill all wage inequality is by helping to make sharing wages a normal thing,1,NOT
i figured being a vox video that it would have a leftist agenda but was very well balanced nice work great video informative and accurate companies aren't actively discriminating its due to biology and biased cultural tendencies to leave women with larger burden of housework leading to them being unable to put as much focus on their careers also i'd mention men have biological advantage in physically demanding roles which often pay well,1,NOT

there's also the fact that women on average go to the doctor more often takes more sick days and works less overtime this is not to say anything bad about women they are usually and i dare to say of course on this more likely to be the ones that take care of children and do chores around the house besides if you earn more than 00k dollars a year before tax then there's nothing to complain about.,3,NOT
while this is interesting and re-contextualizes things neatly you've gotta wonder why literally all statistics show that women earn less even if it's not as big a gap as is usually mentioned we went from 0 to 0% is uplifting but it's also still 0% plus all the data you mention talks about women in positions of relative privilege so‚Ä¶of course they have it less bad than the average woman does.,1,NOT
isn't that an income gap and not a wage gap then?,1,NOT
people get paid by their performance look at the nba and the wnba nba makes more because the men are far more entertaining then women because they are more athletic(so they can dunk and do flashly moves) dont think so you think wnba players are the same as nba players well is there a dunk contest with wnba players nope lets face it in reality men are far more superior then women we are better then women in everyway dissagree with me again well look who won woman of the year in 015.,6,ABU
this is a better way to look at it.,1,NOT
thanks you for being objective but is any of this accounting for how women on average work less hours overall or are less likely to push for longer hours and promotions and what about manual labor any kind of gap would be generated by the fact that there are significantly less women in those fields but i'm sure findings will reveal that on an hour to hour basis the place to begin that women make exactly as much by the hour.. seeing as anything other then equal pay is illegal and institutions and organizations exist to enforce that the gap is misrepresenting the stats by the fewer collective hours otherwise the bbb or someone would be stepping in which goes to show you can't fix something that isn't broken if i could fix anything it would be that feminism would be defined as superiority instead of equality since it's not about equality it's about revenge things were so unequal for so long that now they have to be unequal the otherway instead of balanced like they should.,2,NOT
this confirms what i've suspected for ages having children is a massive waste of time money lol,2,NOT
didn't watch but instant dislike one more feminist video from vox and i'm unsubbing,3,NOT
so the solution is for women to stop having children?,2,NOT
vox didn't say that the wage gap was not down to patriarky which would of been nice to shut up some feminazis,5,ABU
this video didn't acknowledge the large amount of women who do not have kids are are still paid lesser than their male counterparts my seniors who have graduated my law school were paid lesser than the men when offered the associate post maybe it's it just about kids.,1,NOT
this video was really well explained and informative it shows that the wage gap is real but not for the stereotypical reasons that are being put out,1,NOT
18k of dislikes are the crazy femnists who can't handle facts.,3,NOT
i really wish that they would have covered the blue collared skilled labour jobs that's a whole different story the gap is huge when it comes to pay and advancement between the sexes.,1,NOT
cue the comments against the wage gap despite the video pretty much debunking the generic argument from the left.,2,NOT
maybe the wage gap is larger in business fields because the hours tell to be more flexible so women are more likely to take more time off to care for their children and therefore may not be as productive or meet as many quotas as their male or childless counterparts?,2,NOT
so there's no discrimination...correct ,1,NOT
94 of people who die at work are men  are women why do feminists never talk about this?,2,NOT
it should be equal wages,1,NOT
gotta love it how vox uses ww showreels to exemplify the amount of women used in hard labor jobs when men were less available because they were drafted to fight wars.,2,NOT
or women could just be more flexible with their hours like men are,2,NOT
gotta love feminism bashing women who want to stay home and raise their kids it's almost like raising people is more important than money or something,3,NOT
a lack of action does not imply a negative action i think the biggest reason people think of the wage gap has some patriarchal influence is their firm belief that everything is a zero sum game they are unable to see that free trade and laws protecting the individual can help both parties without hurting a third party a third party is only hurt in the fact that a transaction may have not been completed individuals should have every right to pay for whatever they want when both parties benefit and nobody loses especially when purchasing or selling labor.,3,NOT
there's multiple factors when it comes to wages like different bosses education levels how long you worked there and even what college you went to plays a factor it's not your gender that dictates how much pay you get.,2,NOT
surprisingly non-sjw for vox,2,NOT
it's hard to like listen to you seriously like when you talk with vocal fryyyyyy it sounds like you need a lozenge.,3,NOT
there's only two possibilities here women are ignorant of the fact that more demanded skills more hours and more experience=more pay or they are trying to justify getting something for nothing victim status can be used as a weapon never forget that.,5,ABU
i believe this is inaccurate i make just as much as my male and pale counterparts just find a good place.,2,NOT
this information doesn't take into an account how men usually work much more hours than women more hours more money.,2,NOT
i would argue that modern feminism and equality has made it harder for women,2,NOT
"did you count college drop outs,high school drop outs,the difference in job fields when it comes to pay and ect.if you did then you would know that the pay gap isn't caused by sexism but the decisions people make in college and highschool example one kid has a major in art the other has a major in chemical engineering which would pay more people would say chem engineer but what if the artist was incredibly talented and had good advertising skills than that artist would pay more no matter the gender so if the chem engineer was male and the artist female would you say i'm wrong plus what if said artist decided to do commissions by companies and also bid paintings online so now do you think that the female artist is no richer than some one like steve jobs so through those decision's the artist is rich while the engineer is the average male but what's the difference the only difference is the one is talented while the other has no talent nor exceptional education in the field so the only one that's to blame is himself for not picking the most suitable job i'm thirteen and even i can tell some of what you said was bs! ^‚àÜ^)",3,NOT
lol this deserves an unsub im finally free,3,NOT
the only thing i'm concerned about is what major that high starting out of college?,1,NOT
women you want to get paid more do engineering or construction simple don't complain about a wage gap that doesn't exist,3,NOT
flexible hours for everyone !!,1,NOT
stop preaching this alt right 01 bigotry,3,NOT
liz plank isn't going to be happy about this video,2,NOT
hey vox wtf gender gap betwen to genders ?? i want a gender gap study betwen all  genders üòÇüòÇüòÇ,3,NOT
informative video and all that but listen to it yourself and pay attention to the sound at the end of your sentences.. once you hear it you can't not focus on it,3,NOT
that there's is none,2,NOT
but these fathers are sacrificing their free time and seeing their family because they are working more to make their family lives better you have to include sick time off overtime....,1,NOT
ladies say to me that's not a women's job. then i hear that's unfair pay because i'm a women‚Äù from them i scratch my head at the contradictions either your a whiner or you truly are crazy.,5,ABU
yea what they miss is that people lie vox deliberately lie to them about this non-issue to push their agenda it's a hoax,3,NOT
the vocal fry at the end of each of her sentences made this impossible for me to watch with the sound on thanks for the subtitles though!,3,NOT
this was surprisingly so much less left agenda than i thought it was going to be this content was pretty neutral cool!,2,NOT
but women are in college at higher rates than men?,1,NOT
ballshit i work with two girls i have the same hours they get the same money,3,NOT
guys i have an idea what if.. the wage gap is actually caused by a combination of the phenomenon described in this video the fact that women might be less ambitious on average and a bit of old school sexism?,3,NOT
feminist why can't i earn six figures with my masters in women's studies damn patriarchy realists why would i waste so much time and money on a women's studies degree?,3,NOT
depends if you consider child-rearing damaging to a woman's life statisticians concerned with the wage gap will have you believe that's the case.,1,NOT
so basically the wage gap is made up and its actually all down to each persons choice as to how much they make and how much effort they are going to put in to finding a job they really want or that pays allot.,2,NOT
maybe it's because some men work much harder than women of the same profession?,3,NOT
this is so much better and more nuanced than that last shitty video vox released on the wage gap.,3,NOT
feminists don't factor in job position in job and level of education.,3,NOT
you didn't cover different job choices even if you close the average gap within a job there are still differences between types of jobs poor analysis missing such a big factor.,3,NOT
it cant be technically correct with all the differences to many facts keep it from being correct thats like saying all men are rapists because of the few men who did commit rape but the gap between the 9.99 that never committed that crime and the .0 that did can be explained while still saying technically all men are still rapists.,2,NOT
you bastards got it all wrong you guys are a bunch of feminists looking for something to go on with your agenda you are retarded and the wage gap has been illegal since 969 you don't take in mind that generally woman work less hours take more days off go to lower paying jobs also men for example have higher times in jail and have a higher suicide rate along with higher deaths at jobs not to mention that a lot of triggered feminists cause men even if the didn't and then ruin there lives in fact woman are probably more privileged then men i could go on for ever to be honest.,6,ABU
flexible hours also help with mental health and stress this is a great goal to work towards for everyone.,1,NOT
same old argument.. same old bs.. same old arrogant person trying to push the fact that there is a gender pay gap which there isn't men get payed more because of the variables.. if u hired a woman and a man for the exact same job they would get payed the same.. but men usually work longer later and are less likely to take vacation time,3,NOT
somehow i feel ezra klein chief editor at vox must have been on vacation the week this video got the green light to be posted he would have a fit and cry sexism if he saw this then go back to celebrating the slanderers at the splc and telling sam harris that islam is a religion of peace.,3,NOT
please get your head out of your ass!,3,NOT
bbbbbbut there are even five genders triggered4noreason,3,NOT
equality some are more equal than others,2,NOT
it's funny how this video disproves the wage gap,1,NOT
simple if someone does a job as well as someone else they get paid the same doesn't need to involve race gender background or religion just how well the job gets done.,1,NOT
i understood absolutely nothing in this video d,1,NOT
 k k bitchy feminist woman that have no husband to complain to because they so bitchy!,6,ABU
as any woman working in a science lab will tell you correlation does not prove causation so it's nice to say women get paid less because they have babies! but not all women have children not all women are the primary caregiver and the wage gap still exists it might factor in but a survey will never ever prove a causal relationship and honestly the wait until you're  when your wages will match! and she's just also raising a family! are flimsy excuses anyway by the time wages level out later in life the man who was making 5 more than a woman in the same position will have a much larger savings retirement and pool of assets than the woman so that's bull pucky you shouldn't have to wait until nearly retirement to get paid fairly try again.,3,NOT
400:25 is not 0 less it is 7.5 less at least get your math right.,2,NOT

boy do i miss the wage gap that were the good times.,3,NOT
work less paid less.,3,NOT
i dont understand why people see the wage gap as feminist lies when as a woman i have always seen it as a call to action to try harder and do more how does that even bother people its a good thing to strive for equality,1,NOT
so basically women like taking care of their kids,2,NOT
i just like that im given facts in this video usually its a young woman calling me a sexist pig lol,2,NOT
men should really take up more of the child's stuff.,1,NOT
vox will make a five and a half minute video to sustain a feminist myth it's an earnings gap and notice how they never compare people working the same jobs for the same employers yet you'll never see a video about how there's only about an  disparity between men and women in being the recipient domestic abuse which is actually likely much less considering men are far less likely to report not to mention many care facilities for domestic abuse victims will turn male victims away simply on the basis of sex then there's also the rate of male rape victims and female theyre extraordinarily close hardly anyone in the media spotlight talks about that certainly not vox or on the subject of work itself how women have two to one odds to men for being chosen for stem fields in the name of equality. plus we have built educational programs to encourage women into fields like physics science and math i can tell you with certainty that men do not receive these support systems also most important of all wage discrimination is made constitutionally illegal by the 4th amendment and reaffirmed by equal rights of the 0s also maybe this thing called evolutionary biology puts women in the role of primary cause y know they're the ones popping out the babies if you want to be seen as a credible news organization vox then tell the full story and maintain some ethics in reporting.,3,NOT
it's a pay gap not a wage gap.,2,NOT
men work more hours men make more money mystery solved.,2,NOT
like the video but annoying af accent.,3,NOT
men are less privileged than women in the us they spend more time in prison for the same crime if charged with rape they will almost definitely be sent to jail guilty or not and if they aren't they can be fired from their job for a false accusation if they are divorced they have a high chance of losing custody of children they are expected to do more dangerous jobs and risk their lives in things hardly any women would do in first world countries they are called sexist for just being male and are overall hated by feminazis,5,ABU
you also forgot to add things like working overtime between men and woman,2,NOT
controversial subject reported jk xd,2,NOT
how the care is divided up can be boiled down to instinct men often increase their work hours while women often decrease their hours of work this is something that no amount of social pressure of political activism could ever change this is because there are biological reactions that women have to rearing children even years after they're born specifically one that happens for most of a child's infancy is lactation breast feeding isn't something you can do and work at the same time even if your work is from home on a computer and it's something that only women can do one of the things about the early physical reactions to kids that women have is that they create habits in the time that the mother can't work due to recovering from pregnancy and and a cocktail of chemicals that the brain releases resulting in women not even wanting to be away from their child for minuets the father assuming that they're still in the picture has increased his hour of work in an attempt to ensure that the family is well provided for putting his boss in the habit of expecting him to continue to go above and beyond which pretty much locks his situation unless he's willing to loose his job in which event the family would fall apart due to financial struggles so he's not going to risk that and since his hands are tied by the time the mother is capable of entering the work force again she ends up having to take a more lenient job with time at work which often pay less than the jobs where your lack of presence could cost the company money in which case you'd be fired so that she can remain on all in case of an emergency with the kids during early child care it's not possible to divide up the work evenly and later during child care people are prone to habit and often don't bother trying to fix what isn't broken.,2,NOT
if women get paid less then why dont companies hire only women lol?,2,NOT
what people who discuss this issue never take into account is the fact that men are generally more aggressive and take higher risks when it comes to finding employment they also are more likely to hold out for higher pay instead of taking a job sooner this vid also doesn't mention the fact that though women in dual income households take more and better care of the children men generally do more of the household manual labor repairs maintenance additions etc) yet another incomplete and misleading view of pay gap between genders.,3,NOT
you know what i like this video its not just some ignorant feminists saying we earn less because sexism! i tend to take arguments in which certain properties of a group of people are the focus rather than their defining qualities here they dont say women earn less because sexism but rather that women earn less because they take different jobs or that women and men in the same field dont make as much because women tend to work less or care more for children and what not good job vox you're actually educating people.,2,NOT
for anyone who wants to save minutes of there life tl;dr people make different choices men tent to choose to work more women tent to choose to care for kids more.,1,NOT
you never see them mention garbage truck drivers or sewerage/water treatment site workers on the lists,1,NOT
so even female pharmacists still make less than their male counter parts.,1,NOT
yeah women are better care takers than men i don't get what's wrong with that stupid feminists.,3,NOT
not certain why neofeminists feel it is incumbent upon them to lecture the world on the proper division of responsibilities within a relationship there are a myriad of reasons why and how a couple may choose to split their time between work home and family but regardless of the result it remains their decision to render and they typically do so to further the family's advantages not to promote a social agenda if either partner honestly believes they are being taken advantage of it is incumbent upon them to speak with their significant other and attempt to resolve the issue it is not the purview of progressive gender ideologues to resolve those issues for them.,2,NOT
you forgot other important factors like work extra hours sickdays vacations different life choices ambitions etc...,2,NOT
where i work women tend to want to work less hours and call in more often then men they also complain more about work and usually the manager has to cater to the woman more when it comes to the task at hand it's just a number game though i can't say that there isn't women that are more capable then me but when it comes to labor it's hands down a man's industry,5,ABU

you took a survey of men and women who graduated.. okay did every single man and woman go into the exact and job no they problem with this gap does not bring into the choice that women choose versus men,2,NOT
the stupidity is too high with this wage gap  stop calling it a wage gap.. because it was never about wages it was about earnings  then add more truth to it and specify median yearly earnings gap that way we can understand what the hell we are actually talking about  then you look at the worked hours per year.. and you will see the same gap.. surprise not because it is totally illegal and economically stupid to pay different amounts to different people doing the same work  and in the end you can simplify to median worked hours gap so to summarize the false male hating feminist narrative of wage gap it is in reality a simple median worked hours gap and we can all go to rest knowing that men work more therefore earn more and we can also focus on what is important if we actually care about the gap.. to allow women work more hours but because we all know that feminists and libtards never ever cared about the real issue and they are all in for male bashing.. they will continue to use the debunked false wage gap narrative... i can bet you 00 that years from now i will open a leftist feminist website and i will read another stupid male hating gender wage gap article that paints all women as victims and all men as predators.. because why the hell not?,5,ABU
if you confine your research to married working couples then why should the wage gap even matter at all the household is going to benefit if one party is being paid more regardless of who that party happens to be.,2,NOT

there were some lightly misleadingly used statistics in here but i like the overall message so gave it a like,2,NOT
"women usually go into lower paying jobs thats why there is a wage gap""",2,NOT
the statistic you start out with covers all jobs not just harvard-type office jobs please include the jobs that are more physically demanding dangerous it health-impacting because those are also in the original statistic and are done mostly by men men will do these jobs because a they pay more and b they are trying to support the women in their lives truck driving construction mining firefighting policing mechanic jobs and so on may have some representation by women but it tends to be small women tend to want the safe clean office jobs but who built the office buildings and got paid well for doing the rougher job in the end black lung disease is a male disease and men make up for a disproportionate share of workplace fatalities because they are trying to earn good money for their families and then they get dinged for earning more how heartless can you get?,2,NOT
say no to equality of outcome kids equality of outcome is bad mkay,2,NOT
no mention of women out-earning men in their 0s no mention of women graduating from university at a ridiculously higher rate than men while men on average are more likely to go into a trade and become a plumber/painter/builder/mechanic etc men virtually run the labor force but that's ok we don't want those stinky jobs we want to be ceos and scientists! men are 9.9 of garbage collectors not a problem we don't want to collect garbage!,3,NOT
they arr only women no importance in life,6,ABU
i had a teacher in high school help explain this to me she had two children for both children she of course had to take time off of work and while her and her husband are both teachers with their doctorates in education when they retire he will end up having earned more money then her why is that because for each child she had to take roughly a year off work having her salary cut in half while her husband continued to work a big issue mentioned in this video is that women are still responsible for most of the household duties even with full time jobs ever hear of a father on paternity leave‚Äù if the responsibilities were more equal maybe the pay gap would decrease yes in most jobs men and women will get paid the same amount of money if not there would be an even bigger uproar about this inequality its the longterm issues that the pay gap is about imagine having to try to divide or attention and priorities between work and your children evenly while your gender counterparts dont have this issue.they can automatically place their attention on work giving them a leg up in the workplace raising a child is a team effort and what kind of team mate leaves you with all the heavy lifting just to claim the gold medal not saying this is the case for every family but the statistics say its the case for a lot.,1,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap there is none.,2,NOT
"don't call it a gender wage gap to mislead people just call it different life choices earnings gap"".",2,NOT
so the soulution is to force women to work in profession that they don't want just too have the same pay yay great soulution by feminists taking awaya women right to choose her job,3,NOT
this does not account for the fact that it is more likely that men work overtime and therefore deserve a promotion in jobs and pay.,2,NOT
also fun fact the wage gap is a lie men often take more high paying jobs since we look more towards science and mecanica but women look more to serving and receptions just to call a few examples,2,NOT
in the us it's been illegal since the 0s to pay unequally for the same job,1,NOT
so the wage gap is true in certain cases but not to extent we've been told,1,NOT
the video confused me a bit so does the gender gap exist or not what i took away from the video is that the average woman earns less than the average man because she works less hours if so then logic dictates that the gap doesn't exist it's just statistics that lean towards men's favour.,1,NOT

why have we not shifted our focus after all these decades considreing what has happened women have become less happy and we have too few children to sustain ourselves.. we need to widen the wage gap not close it we need more kids more mothers tending to their children family is more important than wasting away in a cubicle more important for women and more important for our society overall a fairly respectable video but as is standard with vox the presentation seemingly made for year olds was revolting as always,5,ABU
why do they have to eat around the bush why can't they just say it is due to flexbility of the hours they kepts getting me lost....,2,NOT

give men equal parental rights maybe this would help but won't fit the feminist agenda,3,NOT
1 this video specifically asserts that there is not a a wage discrepancy due to sexism or anything like that  this video attributes the cause of what wage discrepancy to the different occupations women choose to take.  this video recognizes that women are more likely to raise children and does not suggest that this should change  this video acknowledges that as jobs become more flexible child care becomes less of a conflict and thus narrows the otherwise natural gap.  this video does not suggest that anything needs to be done other than maybe encourage possibilities that make occupations more versatile they don't argue that any sexism exists in the first place to fix but merely that the wage gap will disappear as jobs become more flexible come on people if you want to argue against the ignorance spouted about how sexist the world is make sure that you're actually targeting the right things if anything this video attacks the fallacy of the 7 cents figure.,1,NOT

"hi freelee i have been vegetarian since i was eleven years old always with a keen disinterest in the taste of meat i recently decided i would go vegan and began exclusively eating a plant based diet but despite feeling good i found i was losing too much weight i wasn't big to begin with so the weight loss was dramatic i've turned back to dairy and eggs as a dense calorie source but i'd like to continue the transition--though unsure how to expand my stomach enough to accommodate the volume of fruits and veg required to maintain a healthy weight i hoped you could address this in a future video also i struggle slightly with the idea of consuming as many calories as an obese person or person eating for two, and not with the fear of gaining weight but with the knowledge that our planet has limited resources and in . billion if half of us are eating for two wouldn't that seem closer to 0. and a deeper strain on the enviroment any thought you have on this topic would be great thank you )",1,NOT

"it doesn't matter whether or not she's trolling or if she'll stick with it if we treat her kindly with respect and thoughtful support if we help educate her and encourage her not only will trish be more likely to really stick with the plant based diet and hopefully cut out animal consumption in other areas of her life but it helps spread the message to all of her audience so her followers can see that vegans aren't crazy pushy freaks but are actually just concerned people who want to help animals that could help a lot more people go vegan than just attacking trish for oh she's just trolling oh she can't do it"" lets remember to extend our compassion to everyone!",1,NOT
when she first uploaded this i thought it was a joke her trolling so i didn't watch it was on a news page today and this video came up and they wrote about it so i was like hol up she was serious???? so i had to come back and watch this and this is just absurd i don't even know what to say lmaaaaooo,1,NOT
my brain just imploded ,1,NOT

tbh i don't like trans and i'm an asshole yea but i really dislike shit like this,5,ABU
okay you need to stop because there are actually people who watch you that are transgender nonbinary and genderfluid! you should educate yourself by getting friends that have gone throught the bs that family members that don't accept them! people lose their lives every day because of this educate before talking about this crap!,2,NOT
and gay men don't get fucking sex changes so here is a lesson trish gay men date gay men they keep their parts and stay as male lesbians are women who date women drag queens are men who dress up in women's clothing transvestites are men who like wearing womens clothing with no goal to become a woman transgender male to female and female to male we are individuals who have body dysphoria our bodies don't match our brain state we hate having the parts we were born with and fight to become the the gender which will align with ur mind heart and soul we are the ones who get sex changes bisexuals are men or women who will date both sexes hope this helped we don't do it for attention we don't do it to get onto tv or put in magazines and we certainly don't use it to get views.,1,NOT

let me get this straight i'm not she wants to go through the entire process to become a male... just so she can dress up as a female?? i'm not hating or anything i'm just very confused on her thought process,1,NOT
accidently a biting satire of a infectious memetic gender identity delusions ,1,NOT
i've never been so confused in my life,1,NOT
ok so what i got from this is that she just wants a shorter haircut because she doesn't like brushing her hair.,1,NOT
i now what she's coming from i have always wanted to be a girl and i thought i was born someone else in a different body i am not that happy of being a boy and going through what guys have to go through but i also don't want to go through the process of being trans i am gay i love being feminine if i could choose anytime i wanted to i would change to a girl without having to go through a different process i love you trisha there are a lot of haters in the comments but you keep being you and never stop being yourself <<333,1,NOT
love love love your hair ,1,NOT
i came here because someone has a petition to have her looks and sounds like a her removed from yt because she is offensive whether i agree with her or not i defend her right to say what she wants without being censored don't like it change the channel and now i will go watch something else.,1,NOT
this bitch really used her zac efron in the thumbnail lmao. ahhhhhhh.,3,NOT

trish actually shut the fuck up i'm sorry but i'm calling bullshit,2,NOT

so is she trying to say shes gender fluid and likes drag ,1,NOT

have you explored nonbinary or bigender as a better label for your gender gender is very individual and there might not be an exact label for your identity but those might better encompass what you have said in this video,1,NOT
girl shut the fuck up.,3,NOT
this video pisses me off to the core not once have you mentioned real gender dysphoria in my eyes you need dysphoria to be trans i hang out with mostly boys too that doesn't make me trans you seriously are making the trans community who go through hell everyday look bad shut the fuck up fr,3,NOT
ok this video blows my mind not because trish is nuts and we all know that but because of all the hate comments so according to some of you only someone who looks the way you think they should can claim to be transgender way to be accepting.,1,NOT
how long before this starts a ton of shit in the lgb community?,1,NOT
does she know what non binary means because the whole time she keeps saying how she sometimes likes being feminine and masculine but then calls herself transgender and a gay man wth is going on,1,NOT
it's really sad that she's doing this with the assumption that is all accepting yet most of the comment and dislike are from people in/of support of the community she wants to be a part of.,1,NOT
what the fuck is this video,2,NOT
5:3 ignore this i'm gonna make a remix,1,NOT
should have stuck to eating food videos  this is it for me.,1,NOT

‚Äúi'm very much about b**bs and i love showing them off i'm sorry no trans man would ever say that i know tons of fem trans guys but none of them would use that word to talk about their chest i used to love trish but this is wild love you review sex toys in lingerie but the fact that you talk about all of the ftm partners you have had makes it sound like it's just sexualized to you or a fetish this is seriously going to do more damage to the trans community than jonathan yaniv the you can be whatever gender you want comment especially pissed me off because that makes trans seem like a choice nobody would choose that i don't want anyone thinking that i think this because she is feminine but the fact that she always has her chest out and i'd very confident about her body body positivity is awesome but no trans man would do that okay this rant is over i'm sorry it was all over the place though nobody is gonna read this far lol),2,NOT
no one asked for this video ,1,NOT

are you okay??,1,NOT
honestly if she is doing this for clout i'm suing if she is gender queer i understand how confusing it is and why she had a hard time explaining this but if she is just saying it bc she is irrelevant or wants to sound woke imma be pissed.,2,NOT
didn't she make a song that she loves jesus?,1,NOT
6:4 gender fluid?,1,NOT
she's confusing her dislike for the way men treat see her when she is feminine and her needing to change her gender,1,NOT
ah s%t142k dizzlikes,1,NOT
...............is she.. ok ,1,NOT
my only problem is that you say you're trans for all the wrong reasons gender is not a choice i did not decide to be transgender but i am wanting short hair because it's easier to deal with does not make you trans having a fetish for gay men does not make you trans wearing sports bras does not make you trans having gender dysphoria however does make you trans feeling overwhelming discomfort and wrongness when people call you she or a girl does make you trans if you'd said something along those lines i feel like this whole thing would have gone very differently i want to support you i really really do but you're making it very difficult,1,NOT
"""i dont wanna identify as they because people will think im schizophrenic wtf",2,NOT

what is on her forehead..?,1,NOT
there are more dislikes than likes-,1,NOT
you are stupid,5,ABU
the fact that this person is trying to explain why they identify as a man is what makes me think they might actually be confusing the fact that they like things that are not stereotypically liked by women with identifying as a man if you are trans it is because you are born that way and it does not have anything to do with your likings manners etc,1,NOT
"""do i think i'm transgender 000 do i identify with my born pronouns 000% hunny you can't be both you can use they them pronouns and be non binary but you can't be he,him,his/she,her hers it's not how it works üòµ",1,NOT

i can't figure you out tbh,2,NOT
hey freelee dont know if you watched shanes new rainbow taco vid but he used the quorn vegetarian mince i was squealing with excitement haha you should watch!,1,NOT
too bad trish is impressionable and actually believes you are thin because of your vegan diet you have falsely led her to believe she can stuff herself with pasta and carbs as much as she wants she just doesn't realize you're a bulimic currently with a huge eating disorder and if you think you are fooling us all out here.. think again i see the signs you've got atrophy of all your muscles anorexic bulimic we know you throw up your food after your big restaurant meals it's just wrong what you do you're a bully and an awful person just because trish was nice does not mean that you're good you suck in every way possible and you are hurting more people than you help.,5,ABU

freelee isn't a mean person she is a highly passionate person who supports a vegan lifestyle if she was a mean person then she wouldn't make a video talking about how proud she is of trish freelee is just an advocate of a vegan lifestyle and is determined to inform the public about animal cruelty and to that i say you go girl! if you don't like freelee then you probably eat meat or do not understand how animal cruelty can really effect people due to how disgusting the industry is keep doing what you're doing girl and i'm happy that you are supporting trish!! much love from here in canada!,1,NOT

hi freelee i've been watching through a lot of your videos recently and you have been such an inspiration that i really think i wanna go vegan in the near future luckily i'm moving back onto campus in weeks where i'll have access to a full kitchen and away from my large family that i live with who makes having a different eating lifestyle a difficult task) but my main concern is will i be able to make sure my body is getting what it needs i have problems with my appetite and rarely feel hungry the act or even just the thought of eating most of the time makes me nausous and dizzy it's extremely unhealthy i know and i wanna work towards fixing it have you encountered anyone who had this problem what kind of tips can you recommend on ways to make sure i'll be eating enough to live heathily on a vegan lifestyle it would mean the world to me if you could point me in the right direction or if anyone else has any words of wisdom.,1,NOT
vegan woop woop i am glad that she is making the change that's awesome,1,NOT
so can anybody recommend any vegan baking videos or recipes or even books i've been a veggie for years now since i was 3 but more recently i have been cutting out dairy products too and changed all my beauty products and all that stuff to natural cruelty free items i think that means i'm slowly converting) i miss baking and could do with some yummy recipes to try cakes biscuits etc also i much prefer videos like these i find the swearing and stuff hard to watch i understand it's coming from a place of passion but it's nicer to hear much more positivity and encouraging words ),1,NOT
vegans dont do anything animals still get killed and just because they are not eating meat doesnt mean that animals are safe now,2,NOT

hi freelee i wanted to thank you and trisha for giving me the motivation to start my new lifestyle i am currently a vegetarian as i knew if i went straight to veganism then i wouldnt enjoy it and i would give up so i am starting vegeterianism and hope soon to convert to having a full vegan lifestyle i have thought about it ever since i discovered your channel at first i hated you and i didnt listen to the points you made but now i fully support the vegan community the thing that really motivated me was if trisha can be vegan then i can too thank you so much!!,2,NOT

watermelon squats babyüçâ,1,NOT
to the comments about this being old footage it honestly doesn't matter whether or not she has eaten animals since this doesn't matter because the journey to veganism is not easy for most people trisha may relapse multiple times what matters is that she is making the effort towards being vegan its important that she keeps going back to it and getting educated so that she can figure out what works best for her and eventually get to the place she wants to be if you're vegan yourself think about how hard it truly was to transition probably you had to make many enormous life changes so you could become vegan trisha is just really starting this journey finally realizing how veganism is a good thing and she should let it into her life cut her some slack this is an opportunity for education not for belittlement if you don't welcome her into the community she won't want to or have the resources to stay.,1,NOT
you and i definitely have the same views when it comes to animals i cry every time i see one of those videos because theyre so innocent and have no voice i hate it (,1,NOT

so what i'm getting from this she has more guy friends and likes them more than her female friends so she's a guy that's the case with many girls she doesn't like attention all the time but she likes to dress up sometimes that's the case with a lot of humans in general she identifies as a man because she likes gay guys and therefore if she identifies as a guy she'll somehow attract them girls can be attracted to less masculine men and be cis she wants to be more assertive and recognizes male privilege and recognizes she wouldn't be called a bitch for being ambitious as a guy ok?? obviously?!?),3,NOT

can't finish this video clearly unaddressed trauma and other mental issues have finally taken its toll.,5,ABU
i feel like she is so mixed up about terms and what it means to be transgender she just wants to be casual and seen as a person rather than a sex object which is how she associates women probably because most of the time that's her experience and that's not something anyone should have to just accept and like that's totally valid but that doesnt necessarily mean that shes a man being comfortable not wearing makeup in your day to day life and being super low maintenance except when you want attention is not a trait specific to men that's how a lot of cis women are too not wanting attention from random straight men is not a trait specific to men having short hair as a woman doesnt make you trans i have a boys haircut but i'm a female it seems like much of her reasoning is just based off of bias of how women and men and gay men and straight men are supposed to be or usually are instead of grouping all straight men in with toxic masculinity and misogyny we need to recognize that any man can be feminine if he wants and of course all men should respect women of course i know it's mostly straight men who dont and who sexualize women and all this but it's not exclusive to straight men either) also her comment about having penis envy is another reason i think shes just mixed up she equates men with power and having a penis with the way shes percieved she is a woman but the trauma shes experienced from being a woman especially a very outwardly sexual woman in todays society has caused her to have extreme biases towards what certain genders mean i'm not blaming her this is mostly indicative of a larger problem in todays society but i feel bad for her that she thinks she has to come to terms with being transgender in order to just live comfortably and dress how she wants very concerned with outward image and she feels like she needs to be trans to justify it,2,NOT

what gets me is how much work these evil companies have put into hiding this heinous crime they commit i think if everyone knew all the graphic details of what factory farms do most would at least cut back animal consumption that's why these companies go out of their way to make sure we cant find this information easily i'm one of the most curious people you will ever meet i have spent time researching almost everything including looking up silly/random topics like the history of watermelon. but these companies go so far out of their way to hide this evil that even someone like me never stumbled up to this topic by myself my sister mentioned it to me a year ago and that's when i researched and learned about this horror even as a lifelong meat eater who loves meat and comes from a meat based culture i couldn't morally continue to partake in this evil i have been vegan since and will never touch meat again i'm very old school and grew up with the idea that men never cry or show emotions. i'm basically the stereotypical tough guy who almost never shows emotions but ever since i learned about this evil act every once in a while it comes into my head and all i want to do curl up into a ball and weep for the poor defenseless animals that we torture so mercilessly we have to invent a new word for what we do to these poor animals because even the word evil doesn't cut it.,2,NOT

i feel this new vegan movement is going to save lives praise god but many people do not have the option or privilege of following a healthy vegan lifestyle emphasis on healthy) until our culture rejects the religion of consumption i don't think veganism can be sustainable or safe for anyone who is not privileged this lifestyle requires us to do our research look for whole food plant sources of many nutrients and monitor our nutrient intake with bloodwork for b-1 among other things) and then make the time to re-learn how to prepare our own food not everyone has access to the time resources or even cognitive functioning to take on this lifestyle in a healthy way i've only been vegan for a year and half and acknowledge it as a privilege i pray that i do not lose access to healthy whole foods but there is no guarantee.,1,NOT

the video buzzfeed would never be balsy enough to make,2,NOT
what does the wage gap even look like in real life you compare the w- of a man vs a woman's w- side by side?,1,NOT
but what i've been taught in places like twitter and youtube is there are as many genders as there are pokemon characters so doesn't that mean there is a gender(s wage gap i know feminism is about having equal rights to a man but what about hold on let me just get the chart out... demigirl genderqueer genderfluid agender bigender transgender and lets not forgot everyone's... oops every persons favourite gender....... attack helicopter the last one is quite new thanks lauren southern isn't it sexist to just only mention men and women especially because they are binary which in today's current social climate are inferior) honestly i find this whole video triggering and i demand you spend money to make the appropriate safe spaces also screw trump for trying to help the american economy which also helps his allies economically as well.,3,NOT
if women actually got paid less why don't businesses hire only women women r usually more reliable and it was save businesses money,2,NOT

i'm glad i'm so goddamn far left so i can enjoy these videos i'd hate to be a republican right now.,2,NOT
the wage gap is total bullshit only white women earn 0.7 to a man's dollar black women make about 0.6 to a man's dollar latina women make 0.5 to a man's dollar statistically speaking edit i watched the entire video and this video is worded very poorly,2,NOT
we live in a meritocracy work hard and you'll get money.,1,NOT
where is septic tank service technician on the chart?,2,NOT
this channel is a circus,2,NOT
i'm surprised it was fair an accurate nice work still.. it only focuses on thing out of about 00 that will have an effect on the wage gap and completely fails to mention that there could be other factors involved baby steps we'll get there eventually.,2,NOT
if woman do the same job as men they will get payed the same as this clearly proves that point it's not because of sexism that woman can not make as much money,2,NOT
my grandad told my mum she could only do a science degree because as a scientist himself he thought that was all that mattered and that it would give her better prospects she's not naturally gifted in sciences and would have enjoyed something like english or philosophy much more as that is what she's good at my mum has a decently paid job now but has low job satisfaction and always says she wishes she had been allowed to follow her passion this is what would have to happen on a societal scale to close the wage gap you're advocating for women to make choices they will regret for the rest of their lives.,2,NOT
the wage gap is bull and women don't want to make more money this is larger due to the fact that men are more risky and are willing to work more they're also more greedy these things are not bad women are and always will be better parents!,5,ABU
it always makes me laugh how many youtube commenters think they came up with some factors that a group of people who run scientific studies for a living did not think of.,2,NOT
women make 7 to a mans 1 but the mans only left with 30,2,NOT
didn't this video just prove the wage gap doesn't exist by proving that kids are the reasons why there is a gap if men took care of kids more wouldn't the gap shift to men or better yet just not have any kids and eliminate the gap?,2,NOT
wait . did they just admit that women make less money because of . personal choices!!!! that's racist!!!!,3,NOT
i don't really see the problem you've proven that the wage gap or earning gap which is a more accurate name is just a natural thing which happen in a free society were people make their own decisions and different choices have different consequences why should we change how different jobs works that would require the government stepping in and changing things and that's sounds to much like communism or big government.,2,NOT
don't have kids it's not worth it also screw to  on top of inflexible working hours you have to waste your life away stuck in traffic because some morons decided it was a good idea to all go to work at the same time,2,NOT
i always find it weird how someone will try and take an academic approach to a controversial topic and still get hate like what are people so up in arms about the video is literally just citing what studies found.,2,NOT
your argument is based on raising children and that those children are raised by a women not sure we as a society should be okay with that conclusion.,2,NOT
don't have kids,2,NOT
what people also miss is that the wage gap isn't real,2,NOT
talk about being way better than buzzfeed,2,NOT
but when will something be done about the pay gap between white men and asian men this oppression must end.,2,NOT
thank god some women are neutral and aren't full on feminists and hate men,5,ABU
if they're comparing median pay wouldn't that be off of a limited set of data in a way?,1,NOT
how many people got eye cancer watching this,2,NOT
i mean with the system that we have it's impossible to ever get to a discussion about the wage gap i'm not a woman i don't know what it's like in the workplace as a woman i'm still a student i haven't even worked before if you go on the internet and look for studies you will find what satisfies your agenda but you won't necessarily find things that accurately show the practical lives of women in the workplace unless you actually go through women to women telling everyone that they are experiencing all sorts of discrimination which are relatively unique to women men have their own problems they're treated awfully in dangerous work they don't even get the proper care they need when injured they work longer hours and are even pressured at times to do so to the point where they want to do so a system in place to ensure that both men and women are paid the same for the same positions of the same jobs with the same level of commitment should be in place everywhere and there is really no denying that i couldn't care less about labels such as feminists or mens rights activists i care about the truth whether or not it challenges my own deeply held beliefs it's really hard to face them but you have to do it or others and yourself will suffer.,2,NOT
let's be clear there should not be a wage gap at all when men and women with the same education in the same/similar jobs should not make 5k less than their male counterparts from the start women should not be making 0 less over a significant portion of their working life compared to men that comes out to millions of dollars women lose out on.,1,NOT
i concur with the notion of increasing flexibility of hours but i find that to be an inevitability and moot from this perspective.,1,NOT
as one of males at my job with  female co workers who constantly call off switch days or just feel like cramping at work there should be a wage gap the law under osha says all work is to be equal male or female and its not men work harder and more is expected of them so who do i sue if im expected to do your job honey i want your money;),3,NOT
there is no wage gap it's literally been illegal to pay a woman less than a man since the 0's,2,NOT
there is no wage gap there is an earning gap because there are more women in lower paying jobs like nursing teaching etc because that is what more women choose to do.,2,NOT
sooo pretty much just tell the father to take care of his kids?,2,NOT
not as radical as i expected but the argument is limp dicked,3,NOT
expected feminist propaganda instead got a fair video explaining that the wage gap exists for a reason not because of sexism if only all of vox's videos were this unbiased and weren't seeping with propaganda.,3,NOT
wait.. people still believe in the wage gap.. come on this is the most basic issue there is and people believe it,2,NOT
maybe women make less because they do not have the same pressure men have to get a well paying job is generally considered a bit embarrassing if a man makes less than his wife so the man is pressured to work more and try harder for better jobs,2,NOT
"i don't know about you guys but i would be grateful to make 250,00 a year...",1,NOT
wage gap is fake news,2,NOT
vocal fry is annoying...,2,NOT
there is no gender pay gap it's illegal to pay someone less based on their gender it's been illegal for quite some time.,2,NOT
im surprised vox would actually tell the truth,2,NOT
you make it sound like a mother spending time for her kid is obligatory they choose to do it.,2,NOT
men work harder than women,2,NOT
so your admitting this is mostly based on choices not discrimination now if i wanted to look at this through the lense of victimhood i could say that men are forced by society to work rigid hours to provide for a family even though they may not want too.,2,NOT
so women earn less because they and men think that woman is the only one who is responsible for domestic works therefore it still is a gender problem.that is what you are missing vox and this is only us statistics what about the other countries for example things are very messed up in turkey they really do pay less a female engineer and a male engineer for no reason.,2,NOT
thank you vox i never thought you would do this,1,NOT
women and men get paid the same for the same work,2,NOT
i bet if they made a man say this they would have been a lot more dislikes,2,NOT
women in aggregate and men in aggregate have different work profiles so why would you expect them to have identical pay outcomes?,2,NOT
so the wage gap isn't about discrimination it's just a natural consequence of the way human nature operates in a given level of technological advancement and abundance.,3,NOT
yay vox waita not buy into femenist dogma and rationally explain it thank god if only the olympics video had done the same tho...,5,ABU
ooh look a video about the wage gap i'm gonna say something about it not existing to make my meme-addict virtual friends think i'm smart without watching the video.,2,NOT
if most women prefer staying home more hours over wasting most of their lives in some company and that makes them happier who am i to judge and to be fair it does seem smarter than some workaholic decisions men make.,2,NOT
also in the uk the women earn 0p every pound not true and feminism is cancer,5,ABU
wage gap is fake.,2,NOT
"womens pay gap gets smaller when she's older cause the guy already retired from work so there doesn't earn as much also 400,00 average wtf the overall average her is around 21,000!",2,NOT
there is no such thing as a wage gap men simply work more statistically work harder jobs 1 of deaths and injuries on a workplace is men this id because women simply don't want to have these jobs and generally work less than men so there is no wage gap men just work harder and that is a statistical fact and i don't care what you say yes there are women who work hard but not as much as men so this whole wage gap thing is just bs that women want us to believe to give them even more of what they want stop using your gender as an excuse and if you use taking care of a child as an argument you are even more ridiculous don't have kids then if you want to pursue a career.,3,NOT
thanks for making a fairly unbiased factual video it was leaning a bit left.. but you made a lot of good points and explained the differences in women and men in the workforce /1 for using your platform to educate.,2,NOT
not really a wage gap more an earnings gap,2,NOT
im so sick of hearing so much about the wage gap the only reason why there is a wage gap is because women are usually the ones that take care of the kids and then when the women go back to work when they are  they are starting a new job so they obviously dont get paid as much as the guy thats been working that same job for  years its not a wage gap its a gap between new workers and experienced workers my parents were both engineers working for the same company in the same job and my mom made less money than my dad purely because she was  years behind in experience.,2,NOT
wage gap is a myth,2,NOT
wow i'm actually shocked vox a liberal-biased news source actually puts out real facts instead of the sjw-agenda this is a step in the right direction the wage gap is not because of discrimination or women purposefully being paid less by male employers this was made illegal with the equal pay act of 963 it exists because on average women choose lower-paying jobs are generally obviously there are exceptions less assertive when it comes to pay-raises and work less hours due to things such as maternity leave raising a family etc.,2,NOT
we don't get custody!,2,NOT
this is going to flip eventually academically females are far out performing males in addition many male dominated industries that don't necessarily depend on higher education are being outsourced or automated recent statistics referenced on other videos similar to this one suggest that almost every college degree holding profession with the exception of stem fields are already majority women also recently there has been a focus on equalizing that field do no doubt this field will see dwindling male presence it make financial sense that the spouse with the lowest earning potential stays home with kids i.e house husbands soccer dads,2,NOT
there's clearly some numbers here that make sense but i bet if u make the variables more common(experience and seniority and productivity and actual individual cases we would see virtually no difference and of course women are going to have more inclusion in raising the child in the earlier years it's just nature that why you they produce milk and actually give birth proper men put it on themselves to become better bread earners in order to support their family and there's nothing wrong with that it's crazy to think that there's people out there who think these gender roles are oppressive and misogynistic if i was a women i would have no issue taking maternity leave to take care of my new child while i know my husband is working hard for our families future.,2,NOT
wage gaps have been illegal since the 960s!,2,NOT
so what this is saying is that to end the wage gap a night job must pay the same as a day job and risky jobs must pay the same as safe jobs and remove the overtime extra pay sorry but that looks a bit unfair thanks for clearing up what you want done to end the wage gap.,2,NOT
earnings gap!!!! compare wages for the same position in the same job and that silly gap disappears. different pay for different positions is nomal.. in cases that there is a pay gap for the same work in the same position that is sexism i'll need some citations if you find any company that does this and should be changed as it is illigal to pay a women less for the same work,2,NOT
wow and i thought i was doing alright when i got out of business school i wasn't even in the same bracket as these men or women.,1,NOT
for a culture change to happen it all starts with woman it's their decision on what job they want it's their decision if they want to stay at home and raise a family no one is forcing any of this on you if you end up with kids but don't want to quit working then don't talk about it to your spouse don't just accept it as oh i'm a woman so he expects me to quit my job no that's a stupid mentally you're just hurting yourself with a mind like that of course there are jobs out there that will prove too difficult for woman and that's just how our bodies were made men have more muscles than woman and their body structure helps with hard jobs but if you want that job too ladies you can although some might say it's easier for men to grow in strength doesn't mean woman can't either.,1,NOT
fyi this study is only w caucasian women this is not the truth for women in minorities that make much less...,1,NOT
its literally bull tho lmao,3,NOT
i would like a video discussing men being stay at home fathers and the discrimination they face please.,2,NOT

thank you vox for making the sources for all of this easier to see by putting them in the description.,1,NOT
the video alludes to women working in different fields lower paid fields earning less money and then goes on to completely ignore this for the rest of the video part of the sexism of the wage gap is that female-dominated professions are paid at lower rates than male-dominated professions this isn't because they take on less risk or are less valuable to society it is because the value of these roles is not acknowledged because traditionally the value of women is not acknowledged the nursing profession the teaching profession the childcare profession these are all highly valuable to society and high risk yet the are paid lower amounts.,1,NOT

"wow they actually halfway explained the facts instead of just blaming it on sexism they did leave out that during this time one of the major reasons that the responsibilities with children were so unequally distributed was because this was a time when about half of marriages ended in divorce and fathers rights were being trampled on by the courts and fathers were expected to pay child support and alimony out the ass while having little to no interaction with their kids so of course if your husband is giving you a check your not going to work as much as the man that has to pay that check things have gotten better with fathers rights now due to men who fought for them with angry feminists battling them the entire way but hey this is a big improvement over five years ago when this video would've been the wage gap exists because i'm a victim and i'm a woman so if you try to prove me wrong with facts you're sexist.""",2,NOT

there is no wage gap pay is commensurate to the experience and ability of one to perform the tasks in a job this means if you put the exact same hours in the exact same amount of effort and professionalism into a job your paycheck will show it it has nothing to do with gender skin color sexual orientation or any other trivialities women have different priorities so their paychecks show it.,2,NOT

excellent video which actually represents facts and figures well done ,1,NOT

great video my only recommendation is that for a data heavy presentation like this you make you citations more accessible a lot of them would be really interesting to follow up also when you present try to sit up because when you lean over you have less control of the air coming out of your body and it leads to excessive vocal growls at the end of every sentence--which is a common nervous issue great use of diagrams and i appreciated the slight pauses in-between dense bits of data also a great job of breaking down statistics i have a much better understanding of what issues are related to wage gaps now after seeing this video.,2,NOT
tbh she lost me during the video she jumped between too many things.. from what i saw she didn't explain about how the waige gap is calculated she didn't explain how ment tend to work overtime.. women on average work 6. hour weeks while men work about  hour weeks.. if you divide the numbers women roughly work 0 of the time.. now if we calculate time taken off for child care vacations ect women will work far less than men not including the overtime men work.. she also didn't talk about how women tend to choose lower paying jobs and fields than men.. there's another huge factor,3,NOT

while i like the idea of reducing wage differences between sexes i'm deeply skeptical of increasing flexibility in many fields of work as flexibility often in practice means that the employee be available when the employer needs them and not that employees enjoy more self-direction it might be true for higher-educated professions but for working class people flexibility can simply be a euphemism for a business conveniently refusing to hire them full time so families have to resort to multiple part-time jobs in order to make ends meet sometimes with short-term contracts and very uncertain employment conditions.,3,NOT

what people miss about the wage gap it doesn't exist if you count the number of hours women on average work it narrows to roughly 8 if you take into account the different careers women choose it narrows down to 2 if you consider how women are less likely to ask for a promotion from their boss it narrows to 00% or even in some cases 07%,2,NOT
that there is none,3,NOT
so many dislikes for a fairly neutral video i liked it vox informative.,2,NOT
i see two solutions to this problem wage increases for lower-income jobs encourage women to take up ceo and political positions and ask for raises more it's well-known that women are not as interested on average in ceo and political positions as men that is why it's fair that women make up 5 of politicians because about 5 of the people running for office are women if this has to do with their upbringing then this can be fixed but if this is just because women on average don't want those jobs then the only solution is to raise the wages on lower-income jobs also i find it ironic that women in the us are the majority of people going to and graduating from college yet they're still under represented in higher income positions.,2,NOT

"the wage gap is caused by women themselves due to their career lifestyle financial choices etc.. it has nothing to do with employers or the patriarchy, if women were paid less than men then why wouldn't employers only hire women?",2,NOT
the video kinda proved that the pay gap doesn't exist by itself however let me rephrase it women are paid less on average because they make different lifestyle choices like working dangerous jobs in remote areas what the video asserts is the solution is to change the way businesses operate to suit workers while this is ideal for getting rid of a number previously proven to mean nothing the gender wage gap this will never happen as meetings are not scheduled around home life and if they are they will be erratic and inefficient as such while this is one example i think the message that should be taken from one of vox's best political videos is that the wage gap is while a fact not one that is directly indicative of the common implication that men are paid more.,2,NOT
field of business demands lot of skills couple are risk taking and dominant behavior men are naturally more risk takers and try to defeat their rivals hence men on field of business generally tend to do better results and hence are more desirable therefore better pay also there is no such thing as wage gap it's earning gab which is based on experience education talent how long they spend at job and how often they get sick once these things have been taken into account then that gab suddenly is almost nothing.,2,NOT
who else is looking for feminists in the comments?,2,NOT

this makes a lot of sense my mom is an attorney which means hours are flexible and can be done whenever as long as they are completed at her firm you can see how much everyone makes and she's always made as much or more than male counterparts so i've never really believed in the gender wage gap.,2,NOT

the wage gap has been reduced since 948.. that's a given noone claimed there to be a 20 wage gap in 948.. in fact back then the wage gap was closer to  to 0% on a long term effect laws and policies have lowered the gap considerably you can argue that women have different jobs than men but the fact is that they don't work 0 less hours so they shouldn't be paid 0 less regardless of what their occupation is you see the exact same thing when you compare the 0 poorest americans with the other 0 of americans the hour difference is nowhere near being equal to the wage difference.,2,NOT

exactly thank you i think people who pretend that it's  cents on the dollar for the same job are doing more harm than good and unfortunately that includes some people in the public spotlight like obama the implication is that women earn less because employers are mysogonists who systematically opress their female employees duh* yet that's not what's happening there are many factors to consider the most obvious one being that men don't get pregnant and that women are less likely to disregard their family life and children in favor or their jobs.,2,NOT

women take on a disproportionate share of child rearing tasks by their own choice this is the thing that all of these analyses ignore people make individual choices about what they want for their own lives and those choices affect how likely they are to get promoted people have different personalities and those differences affect how likely they are to get paid more or get promoted on average women choose to stay home with children more than men on average women are more agreeable when in entry level positions and focus more on relationships rather than quantifiable results these are facts and they predict success in the workplace it is not sexism it is individual choices about work-life balance.,3,NOT
conclusion there is not a wage gap there is an earnings and field access gap based heavily on hours flexibility with perhaps some employer bias based on the type of worker they're looking for solution there is no direct solution plenty of things to help broadly though most of which involve innovation and an improved situation for all workers.,2,NOT
how come they never provide examples of men and women working for the same company doing the same work and for the same amount of hours being paid differently.,1,NOT

lol the butthurt fascists in the comments make me laugh ,5,ABU
it's more complex because it's inaccurate it doesn't represent reality at all women and men at the same level of experience and seniority in the same fields earn pretty much the same the reason there appears to be a gap is as you said women hold disproportionately more lower paid jobs like child care etc whereas jobs with higher wages like dangerous jobs or jobs in stem fields are predominately male filled men also work for more years on average and take less paternity leave than women take maternity leave mostly because they're offered a lot less) men are also more aggressive in salary negotiations on average and are more likely to ask for a raise.,2,NOT
this is insane wage gap is nothing but a lie,5,ABU
individuals tend make the same wages for the same jobs regardless of gender who cares about averages they don't matter and the idiot masses don't know how to interpret them now stop lowering my earning potential all you've done is kept us all equally poor just ask around everyone in every business is paid the same crummy wages unless you're a friend of the family who owns the place.,3,NOT

cant let my wife see this video ),2,NOT
let's think about this it doesn't account for types of hours or amount that i've seen this means that if later hours pay more and they typically do then the later hours that are made up of men because of their flexibility are being compared as the same as lesser paying hours,2,NOT
stop it get some help,3,NOT
the wage gap was so misrepresented and basically a lie that outlets like vox are trying to salvage any last bit of legitimacy from it the problem is that the implied argument about fairness was never true why because the argument was tried in my view to try and subsidize female workers at the expense of male workers that was the plan all along something for nothing.,3,NOT
women live longer than men do and if a woman is married to a man and that man suddenly dies she will be poor so the man has to earn more money during his life time so his wife can inherit some cash after he dies simple as that.,3,NOT
no gender gape,2,NOT
do know companies would higher only women if they where cheaper to higher because your get better profit margins did to salaries bering lower this is what third wave feminist don't understand that it choices you make not what gender you are that shows difference in pay between men and women because work on average from women is statically less then men have babies therefore months to year off job men are more willing to do more overtime than women it pretty simple if you don't do the time you won't get a dime very simple basic economics.,3,NOT
>vox not being raging leftists i am doubtful of the underlying motive,3,NOT
"i identify as a social democrat but i think a portion of the wage gap truly is due to other factors besides just sexism like experience time off and other factors a lot will disagree but i've looked at numerous studies i welcome all to do a lot the research yes sexism plays a role somewhat i just think people need to be realistic when it comes to issues like this i'm not saying this and other issues needs addressed in any way it does i'm just saying you can't put the blame on any on thing- it is due to multiple factors sexism isn't anywhere near the top reason is all i""m saying debate me if you want but i'm not arguing and name-calling.",2,NOT

if theres a wage gap why dont businesses only hire women???,3,NOT
this is what anti-feminists have been saying all along the earnings gap exists because women choose lower paying fields and work fewer hours than men it has nothing to do with discrimination it has nothing to do with sexism if a woman chooses to have children it will hurt her earnings potential that is just a fact of life women are free to make this choice no one is forcing it upon them.,3,NOT

"thing about the wage gap is how good someone is at the job how long they've been there and time worked is commonly not taken into account,",2,NOT
so for women to get paid fairly men trying to negotiate their own pay have to negotiate for their fellow women's pay because what they can't do it themselves ludicrous to think women shouldn't have to do any bargaining when negotiating their pay that when men's contracts get negotiated the women's contracts have to automatically be fulfilled with the same pay without putting forth the same effort the men did kinda goes against same pay for same work ethic.,2,NOT
alright i can accept a lot of what is being said here one thing though.. with all of these discrepancies being shown how come they are rarely if ever acknowledged by the feminist community it seems rather manipulative i would be much more apt to listen in depth about what they are saying if they would actually disclose all information instead of nitpicking and i'm sure i'm not the only one,2,NOT

these are some valid points the only thing i would add is as follows *note i don't think that the pay gap exists but i'm open to different opinions if they have evidence of their thoughts  women since they give birth to the child they will most of the time be more caring towards a child  women also can get paid maternity leave in which they still get paid their same amount but taking care of a child  if a man and a woman are working in sales with commissions it depends on how they are selling if the man sells more he gets more money if the man sells less he gets less money and vice versa with women.,2,NOT

that there is none.,2,NOT
there is not a gender wage gap there is an earnings gap the wage gap is average earnings of men and women working full-time it does not account for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination.,3,NOT
if a woman chooses to be a mother it should be her primary role when the earnings gap is viewed in contrast to the lack of men's parental rights it makes sense women earn less because they can force their ex husbands to pay for everything if they want the burden of child rearing shared they should also share parental and reproductive rights.,2,NOT
anybody who thinks that women earning less than men is a problem are somewhat wrong if a women wants to have a child and take care of that child then there is no need to try to make more women work i agree that it is an issue that jobs aren't flexible enough for women who take care of children but in the en it makes no sense to change how the entire world works because some people find it hard to do well in work and take care of a child also if you think about it businesses pay the same amount of money to the same amount of staff so having less women working means there are more men working or other women working who could then support the women who have children. money is not being lost from families if women work less.,3,NOT
250k of 00k is 2.5 so it's 7.5 less and not 0 less should be something like while women were earning 0 of what men does no 0 less leaves 0%.,1,NOT
this is a good video it takes into account that men are able to give more to a job because they traditionally have less responsibilities and indicates that women in the position to do the same equal close to the same amount a statistic glossed over quite often i have one contention however the video states that the concept of the wage gap is based on the difference in median income yet what most people actually say and believe is the following women make  cents on the dollar a man makes for the same job. which is very different statement that indicates intentional oppression by employers.,2,NOT
what vox missed it isn't a pay gap  that's been against the law since 963 it's an earnings gap because people make different choices most women want to have children  it's hard-wired into our species are you suggesting that they shouldn't they also want to raise their kids and tend to select careers that allow them to do so are you suggesting that they shouldn't men work more hours work more overtime accept more dangerous and nasty jobs and are more willing to travel away from home for work if women want to earn more there's nothing stopping them all they have to do is spend more time working most seem to want more balance between work and family and that is absolutely fine but the you can have it all indoctrination promulgated by certain activists is pure absurdist fantasy nobody can have it all you have to prioritize and juggle.,3,NOT

i think this video does a better job of explaining the wage gap than most videos however they don't do a good job of accounting for men and women in the same exact career for example in my job as a lawyer where everyone in the equivalent position gets paid the same the wage gap should be non-existent if there happens to be one it's because women choose to work less hours than men for some reason not because they're getting paid less women make different life choices than men so that should be accounted for.,2,NOT
why should i care about people making the top  incomes in the united states?,2,NOT
there's a reason economists dont buy the wage gap think if you could pay women less than men for the same output firms that hire more women would drive the business that hire more men out of business which doesn't happen.,2,NOT

the wage gap is just the average meaning its a generalization of the who earns more money key word is earns) first of all women work more low paying jobs its not sexist if a women chose to be a nurse and not a engineer nothing is stopping them from choosing to be an engineer in fact they are helped into it by affirmative action if a woman does become an engineer and works less hours it isn't sexist if she is working in a lower paying field like mechanical not civil it is not sexist nothing is holding women back they just don't value money as much as most men they usually prefer a job with more stability rather than a private business if a man is a doctor and a woman is earning less as a nurse they made different life choices it isn't a super natural invisible entity called patriarchy its free choice,2,NOT

thank you for not jumping to the conclusion that it is discrimination or oppression like sjws.the wage gap in specific careers really boils down to flexibility in hours.and women focusing on children is often the result of interplay between couples or lack of couples) a lot of mothers would rather be the primary caregiver rather than the father it does not mean that the men are lazy how dare those dads not raise kids more or the mothers are lazy how dare those moms focus on the easy task of raising kids of instead of non-child care chores and work) its just their preferences.,3,NOT

it's plainly illegal in the modern world uk and us for example to pay a woman less for the same amount of work if it's happening she needs to sue otherwise nothing can be done now that feminists have invested billions and a holiday in this total non issue will they consider discussing how men are 1 of workplace deaths and suicides oh yeah that's right they're feminists and they do not care about men at all even to the point of manufacturing issues for attention right now women in the west can either work like any man or become a housewife and have her husband pay for everything then possibly divorce and get half his cash meanwhile men in the west like all of history must work or else they are less then trash feminists have no plan on correcting this huge imbalance and in fact will work to keep it in place.,3,NOT

almost a good and balanced report but your premise still expects society to fix the choices which women make voluntarily which is more important child-rearing or making money why is money the only measure of a successful life and the only way in which feminists feel that a women's worth should be measured what about happiness and fulfilment and family many women do and always will put these aspects of life ahead of making money this will never change and therefore the wage-gap read earnings gap will never disappear.,2,NOT

if you want to put a quick stop to the gender earnings gap you ought to immediately and completely free up the markets and allow capitalism to thrive if a business pays people any less than they deserve that person leaves their job whenever possible to get better benefits somewhere else you pay a person too much your competitors can run more efficiently than you then and top your profits you might worry that structural sexism would throw a wrench in this system not to worry market forces are very robust against bigotry because again the company that pays its employees based exactly on how hard they work will outcompete and outemploy startups from locally to internationally the worst thing you can possibly do to exacerbate an earnings gap is to give subsidies to certain corporations and make unions and employment restrictions if a ceo entrepreneur worker or business as a whole earns money from subsidies welfare or union dues all of which are illegal to not contribute to these funds are socialized/forcefully taken from citizens they have no reason to pay their employees fairly or price products fairly they don't need to work hard at all to earn this perverted capital yet it seems so many who decry this gap are more interested in collectivist egalitarian ownership of wages rather than allowing people basic property rights and the ability to get employed where they want to you'll compromise against actual solutions towards the gap every single time which demonstrates you really don't care about this issue at all.,2,NOT
"this video is trying to prove the wage gap exists by saying wage gap over and over again.. while at the same time explaining what anyone with more than a double digit iq has been saying an earnings gap the video is explaining in a nutshell women couldn't work as much because their schedules dont fit the job. therefore there isn't a wage gap they are simply working less and earning less the men made more money because they worked more that isn't a wage gap no one is slashing cents off of your dollar you're simply not earning the dollar stop self validating your ridiculous feminist agenda with utter bullshit even when you're explaining something else you delude yourself into believing that you are instead justifying a conspiracy if i call it a wage gap enough times people will believe it!""",5,ABU

this is a great and much needed video but we should make working times more flexible just to shrink the wage gap but instead to help a lot of peoples mental health as jobs with long working hours are largely responsible for stuff like depression anxiety and so on so we should be focusing more on that as it will also help shrink the wage gap as well,2,NOT

so basically this says the problem revolves around taking care of children which women are biologically wired to be more inclined to do therefore they're trading their job and thus their pay for their children a choice they decided to make if you work less you should get paid less so employers aren't to blame if taking care of her children makes a woman happier then she should take care of her children in the end the wage gap is caused by biological processes that aren't inherently good or bad which we can't control this means that the wage gap exists but isn't a problem.,3,NOT

i call bs on :10-1:15 women were making 0 less is incorrect 50k is actually 2.5 of 00k which means women were making 7.5 less on the other hand i'm wondering if the numbers were simply very badly made up 00k is exactly 0 more than 50k exactly the odds that numbers come out that precise in statistics from random studies involving dollar amounts from many people are incredibly low so either the numbers are made up or they are very grossly rounded that said i'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say they don't understand simple math they saw 00k is 0 more than 50k and assumed the reverse phrasing would be correct two is 00 more than one but one is only 0 less than two.,2,NOT
"i can agree that flexible hours would help however who stays home with the kids is a decision couples make maybe women need to insist on working as many hours in their jobs as their husbands additionally you broke this down into simple categories which didn't even go into trade jobs or labor jobs) rather than specific jobs an example oncologists and neuro-surgeons or any surgeon is going to make more money by far than a general physician some one with a social science degree who goes into business is going to earn less money than a person with a degree in economics or straight up business this is because more people go into the field of social science than business hours worked is another factor the more hours you work even on a salary job the more likely all other things being equal that you will either get a raise or a promotion it also seems that men are more likely to ask for a raise than women or take the risk of leaving one job for another there are a lot of things which play into the earnings gap and it is an earnings gap not a wage gap same job worked same hours same number of years yields a far smaller or even nearly zero difference in pay it is imo disingenuous to call this a wage gap"".",2,NOT

i feel like you have missed a critical point to the wage gap fallacy this is the fact that if you simply aggregate all of the data for full time men's and women's salaries then you are not taking into account that certain career's pay less than others and there are disproportionate amounts of certain gender's working in certain fields for example lets take teaching and compare that to construction work women are the overwhelming majority of teachers in most countries still to this day and yet teaching in most countries is considered a low pay job on the other hand construction work pays very well in most first world countries and is dominated by males you can make many other comparisons such as nurses vs doctors or retail service assistants vs research scientists and you will come up with similar results now the important question is why less women are choosing the higher paying career paths to this there is not a clear answer but studies suggest that women prefer jobs that involve more social interaction there are other factors such as strict fitness requirements for certain high paying labour-intensive jobs like construction however it is intellectually dishonest to ignore these facts just because we don't completely understand the underlying reasons behind them we need to be focusing on how to get more male teachers and female construction workers if you really want to close this gap' but i'm not so sure that's even the right approach if women want to work in a field that pays less then why should we tell them they can't what about freedom for women to choose their career and is it wrong that teaching should pay less than research science these are far more tricky to answer and no one seems to want to address these questions at all on this channel.,1,NOT

this video made me want to smash my head against a wall she just tried to over complicate the fact that the statistics about wage gaps between men and women aren't accurate and don't take into account the different variables and the type of jobs worked i wish feminist would use their energy more constructively in helping rd world women whom are of wives.,3,NOT
i went to a very good high school but it was soooo politically biased my junior english teacher and history teacher in high school were and are best friends extremely intelligent women and now great mothers but they were also the type of feminists to project any information that made them mad even if it wasn't entirely true the wage gap misconception was definitely the most glaring of those offenses by teaching all of their students this misconception both my history class and english class got into debates about feminism also because it was relevant to the curriculum and people used this wage gap as their base of support that showed the inequality among men and women in the workplace today in the process my school basically trained a bunch of smart kids to not think critically and just assume statistics were true or false based on if it agrees with their political views or not clearly this video proves that the wage gap many of my friends and teachers had in mind is not real but is in the form of a much more reasonable statistic if one was to actually look further into the data instead of getting excited about the it thinking it is true and then ignoring the critical thinking process because they want the information to be true all because it supports their cause while i do believe that there should be equality in the workplace there is no way that we can ignore what is actually causing much of the inequality in average pay to sum up this huge comment thank you vox and everyone involved with this video for creating a piece related to feminism with good critical and analytical thinking skills instead of spewing incredibly biased and false feminist stories while you made a lot of feminists look bad for yelling wrong information at people for so long you also made the movement look much better because you acknowledged as a very feminist channel that something many feminists believe is true is not thanks again.,3,NOT
this video makes the assumption that women being stay at home mum's is going to continue to be the norm and that work hours should work around them how about we change this norm which inherently chooses to oppresses women maybe that should be a message of the video continued increase in women not staying at home to take care of kids and less kids all together.,1,NOT

bitchy jewish girl voice there's going to be some bullshit here,6,ABU
the pay gap is even lower and almost non existent in countries with better maternity leave pay than the us that helps bring the average pay of those women up while theyre having kids,1,NOT
question what's with the obsession of ending the wage gap as the video outlined it's not that women are getting paid less for the same work and instead it's more that they're doing less work or working in lower paying fields this is the outcome of those womens choices they chose to go into that lower paying job/field and they chose to work less hours so why does it matter why do we have to try and force changes just so the government can look at national earnings of the sexes and see that they're balanced there's no inherent value to that.,2,NOT
in a nutshell don't have children.,2,NOT

notice how they simply say average earnings and don't take into account that many women by their free will raise families and take off time from work take on average work less hours than men and other factors it's funny how feminists of today get so angry about some women's choices but not others i thought they were all for that.,3,NOT
wait i'm confused so ur admitting that the wage gap is only the average of all women and all men and it's not the same job what's ur issue then?,2,NOT
the wage gap was debunked way back in the seventies and that's not to mention how much extra support women get in terms of scholarships and grants for their education that men have little to no access to.,2,NOT
there is now wage gap this is just more feminist propaganda,5,ABU
men get more money cuz women expect them to pay for dinner,3,NOT
there's no problem here the women only earn less on average because of decisions they make for themselves to say that there is a problem is more sexist than claiming there's a wage gap because you're saying women should be working the higher paying jobs like the men instead of doing what they want,3,NOT
so the end of the video basically says that the entire world should change the way it does things so that women end up with the same amount of money buahahahahahaa,3,NOT
i thought this might add more credibility if typed by a woman there is no wage gap there's an earnings gap based on career choices women make paying two people different wages based on gender is illegal if you've been compensated unfairly don't take off an hour at work contact the labor board because laws exist to protect you among millennials the highest paid demographic are single females because millennial women are earning way more college degrees than men and are thus getting better paying jobs mostly because public school education favors females speaking of stem half the medical students and the vast majority of biology students are female last time i checked medicine and biology are sciences don't believe the feminist propaganda perpetuated by women's studies courses it's not based on reality ok definitely my last post on here.,3,NOT

i am not a feminist and i actually really liked this video i think the best part was you gave a somewhat practical solution to a practical problem i wish more left leaning progressives would do that because i might actually join them at that point the biggest problem with progressivism is that their best answer to problems usually revolves around cultural change or societal change society and culture are people's responses to the world around them it's not just a dial you can turn to your liking the only real way you can change a culture or society is by forcing people against their will to believe your ideology which historically is best done through a freedomless totalitarian government like stalin or hitler.,3,NOT

a big issue that is often missed every company i've ever worked for has had many women who have refused promotions because the male spouse was self employed ie plumbers electricians etc) the main goal was more about providing benefits like health and retirement that a self-employed spouse could not provide.,1,NOT
women get paid less then men so why dont employers only employ women and save money or does it come down to skillsets?,2,NOT
as a free-market libertarian who has been arguing against the popular perspective on the wage gap i can say that i am very happy with this explanation review and video relating to the problem.,1,NOT
or maybe just maybe it doesn't exist,2,NOT
so if women would just stop having kids and work a little bit harder we don't have to listen to them complain that they're lazy and they like having kids and staying at home if my wife wanted to go to work and work long hours while i stay at home with the kids i would gladly make less money than a woman does.,2,NOT

 its a fact that a wage gap exists have they done any research on the supposed wage gap that had been disproven you could say ah it's all men that have disproven it ahhhhhh oppression well one of the first people to disprove this wage gap was a woman reply with your thoughts on this bullshit,3,NOT
men risk more and work more hours they earn more because of that there is no reasonable or moral reason to force emoloyers pay the same to women who work less and take less risks.,2,NOT

women should take on a disproportionate role in the household they should also teach their daughters to do likewise.,5,ABU
you can't compare self employed men and women because men are more likely to take risks it's proven.,2,NOT
it also doesn't take into account the stem jobs like construction and things of the hard labor that men usually do now it has nothing to do with the thought that one sex is stronger than the other but more to the fact that women don't usually take those jobs also the fact that scientifically men are usually more competitive and will take longer hours.,2,NOT
okey  the newest statistic is  years old  if women do more work with the kids on average when men do more hours work in work place on average i'm happy to see how women like if swap those around  if individual gets more work done with same qualifications in the same time as another do you pay them the same although their worth different amounts of work and if or if not why that's just the start of the problems within this propaganda i would gladly discuss this further.,2,NOT
translation men and women earn the same for equal work but we still need to fight the wage gap thanks vox!,2,NOT
its againest the law to pay someone more if they do the same thing.,1,NOT

where the feminists at,2,NOT
i actually think this is a fair argument at least more than the black and white yes it does exist or no it doesn't exist arguments i think what it boils down to is that a lot of businesses have not evolved to 1st century standards there was a simpler time when most people got up around the same time worked roughly around the same time and went to bed around the same time that isn't true anymore so a lot of business structures need to change which is a far better solution than simply giving certain people more money especially if they do less work.,1,NOT
for all the hate people give social libertarians they have made liberal sjw's back way off on the stridency of their discrimination claim regarding the wage gap now instead of a patriarchal conspiracy we just get a video complaining that women get to play with the kids more and have a more balanced lifestyle for a tiny bit less money progress towards the truth is slow but it appears to be real.,2,NOT
thank god someone stating their sources in the description.,1,NOT
"when a lot of men want a raise and ask for it they get it when a lot of women want a raise they are too afraid to ask for it and get stuck with what they have this doesn't apply to everyone obviously but it does affect the wage gap""",2,NOT
these statistics are completely irrelevant if you don't consider time worked or what type of work done,1,NOT
also women look for men who make more than them a men doesn't care what a women does he just wants her to be pretty so there is an incentive for men to work harder in higher paying jobs.,2,NOT
that motherf*cking vocal fry my body will never recover from all this ear bleeding jokes aside wage gap is as inexistent as your brain my dear.,5,ABU

if a discriminatory based gender wage gap existed then companies would only hire female workers to save money but we do not see this there are many studies that prove that the gender wage gap in fact does not exist all else constant.,3,NOT
there is no wage gap.there are only fat lazy femenists who think they are the center of the world.,5,ABU
women and men are different both have different duties to each their own men go to work whereas women stay at home and take care of the children stay single or have no child if you want the same wage as men i'd be the richest just by hiring low-wage middle age women for my business,2,NOT
money isn't everything i'd rrather have a nice life than being filthy rich,1,NOT

five hours websites government websites job workplace statistics motivational wage seminars and learning about economics vox has proven they can't even get basic journalism right to prove a theory to be correct you have to research it to be false and harshly this is the scientific method id like this to be correct however if your numbers experiment yields unfair able results guess what it isn't real it's a earnings gap and it isn't sexist it's about individual choices and the core belief of equal opportunity not equality of outcome if you stick with a narrative over the evidence you're an ideological individual.,3,NOT

there is no fuckimg sexism related to this because for the same and hours worked men and women earn the same,1,NOT
cuz most women aren't good at business but men are,3,NOT
the wage gap myth is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,2,NOT
there still seems to be a problem with conflating earnings with wages you have to look at additional working hours overtime etc. to have the most accurate conclusions.,1,NOT
the gender wage gap is fake wemon and men do work for different jobs that pay differently on top of the fact that sexism is an opinion and everyone is entitled to an opinion if your boss is paying you less than your coworkers then do something about it instead if complaining about it the wage gap is quite simply wemon who look at a small fraction of a problem and blows it out of proportion,2,NOT

i'm actually surprised about how well made the video is my only question is why is this a problem the results are clearly because of life choices which women make so why do we need to close the wage gap at all?,1,NOT
this vid was interesting for the first minute then all i heard was blah blah blah,2,NOT
so the wage gap exist but not because the world is sexist or patriarchal but because women are usually the one who takes care of the childrens and that effect the wage someone please tell that to those sjw liberals and fake feminist who hate men.,2,NOT
once again kids are the problem!,2,NOT

women take on the bulk of child care duties because they are better at them than men and because raising children is more important than any other job.,2,NOT
milton friedman put it best when governments mandate equal pay laws you make it free for the chauvinists to discriminate a system in which there is no mandated equal pay there is a very visible cost to be discriminatory so how might we best address the gender wage gap if it exists let the chauvinists feel the pain in their pocket books certainly don't make it free for them to be nasty asses.,2,NOT
i always thought women got paid more than men at least in my industry they do.,1,NOT
every time i see one of these videos i cringe a little women statistically are worse at asking for a raise so many studies have been done don't blame the dads like they aren't taking the kids to soccer practise or what ever.,2,NOT

there is no wage gap shocker,2,NOT
wow vox is finally starting to admit that the wage gap claim is a myth amazing never thought i would see this day.,1,NOT
um how about instead we stop making women do all the child care and stop penalizing them for it not to mention this is not a complete picture for instance even in those jobs that have closer salaries women still did make less so where's the explanation there how about the increased wage gap for women of color not to mention we always talk about women choosing to go into fields that make less money when really we just value the labor of women less if tons of women are doing it it must be easy so we shouldn't pay them as much.,1,NOT

who knew the gender which evolved to be as useful and competitive as possible turned out good at doing stuff and working hard weird right?,3,NOT
why are people so against solving problems if it weren't for those delusional mind my pronouns feminists then people would take these real problems more seriously.,3,NOT
this was actually pretty good well reasoned out for a minute video vox has done some pretty bad videos about similar subjects previously but this one seems like a return to form.,1,NOT
so men who work with nuclear fusion should get paid less because of the boo hoos of women?,2,NOT
the wage gap is more of an earnings gap which means that equality of opportunity doesn't equal equality of output,1,NOT
i appreciate that this video acknowledges that the wage gap is not caused by discrimination however it still maintains that women choosing lower paying jobs on average is a problem since when has making a choice that impact nobody but yourself been a bad thing?,2,NOT
this is simply false.,1,NOT
when you piss of both feminazis and meninists you know you've done something right,3,NOT

earnings have you not heard of the word earnings there is an annual gap in what the two genders earn amazingly there is a very sizeable earnings gap between the female neighbour in the house next door on my left and the female neighbour in the house on my right when i learned of this i needed to be revived with smelling salts one is a  year old with babies receiving welfare but who supplements it with a casual retail job i was disgusted to hear she doesn't earn the same as my other neighbour who is a pharmacist who also owns two stores go figure they're the same gender for god's sake!,2,NOT
finally the world is catching up with reality glad to see some research behind the statistics that have been used for almost  years to make women believe men are taking advantage of them time to face it people feminism is all based on bullshit biology is undeniable lmfao!,3,NOT
people read into statistics to much me and my wife worked full time i made 0 more then her she worked  hours a week i worked 0 now the kids are grown and our income reversed she makes 0 more then me we both work 0-5 hours a week very typical of american families.why does everyone devalue women that make the decision to raise children into successful human being materialism is killing america and the rest of the world.,2,NOT
+vox now what i always ask my self watching these videos how is it that house and child care is considered a burden but income generation an opportunity there is no evidence that this in any way reflects actual attitudes towards both occupations in fact it is rather the opposite) so why is it always preented this way?,1,NOT
i still do not understand my first paid job school cleaner i earned less than the female(she had done the job long than me and was my mum i was 0) as a beekeeper i got less than most of the females because they had done the job for longer and where older as a motorbike courier in a different country there was no difference as an it technician in another country all on the same as a driller in the mines no female drillers with my company.as a traffic controller all on the same... ok i have only ever been paid for the hours i work never had a salary but have also in over  years of work in countries i have never seen a difference in pay... i don't get it where/when do i get all this extra money that i am obviously owed as i am male??????,2,NOT

this question just makes it all mess up if women earn less than men why don't companies only hire women?,2,NOT
i love vox,1,NOT
i am sorry i am not able to understand something here isn't wage gap issue regarding the difference in payment for same work done we are still comparing the women's salaries to there men counterparts isn't that exactly what the problem is if the job hours are from - the women has no obligation to stay back for a meeting at and person's other priorities like children etc cannot be criticized by people and should not affect the wages of a job which he/she are doing well.,1,NOT
that's why they get paid less,2,NOT
this makes perfect sense natural market forces and job requirements affect wages.,1,NOT
children isn't the only thing that skews the wage gap women chose lower paying jobs than men do,2,NOT
this video says that women choose to earn less than men therefore we need to change our jobs to be more inconvenient just so they suit women better ye totally.,2,NOT
wtf is this oh wait its bla blaü§£,2,NOT
i think we women usually pick different careers we also are tougher to be nice so negotiating is out of line.,1,NOT
so you just admitted there is no wage gap my god you're stupid.,3,NOT
if i owned a business i would only hire women because you can obviously pay them less think about it...,2,NOT
so many feminists in the comment section supporting the feminazis at vox,2,NOT
this video basically debunked the wage gap while also still claiming that there is a wage gap what,1,NOT
this makes it sound like men are just more ambitious this wasn't a good explanation of this there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap if men were the humans that bring life into the world they would statistically earn less than women,2,NOT
the wage gap isn't reeeeeeeaaaaaalll,2,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap it does not exist,2,NOT
fellow liberal brethren and sistren stay out of the comments i beg of ye conservatives have flooded our safe space with triggering opposing viewpoints don't read their idiotic and problematic posts or they might just change your mind not because they're right but because of their patriarchal control and use of sexist facts'!,2,NOT
another cause is that women tend to choose similar jobs and careers meanwhile men are way more diversify these creates a lot more workers that are needed in certain jobs so the competence in those jobs rise and the salary of all those professionals is reduced why women choose the same hobbies and careers the answer is easy. culture inertia since religi√≥n times most religions did not allow women to do the same things that men did they could not study work in some jobs or do almost nothing more than take care of their childs. that is the gap you are looking for.,1,NOT
yay finally not some bullshit feminists!,2,NOT

the wage gap has been proven false multiple times.,2,NOT
as a man the woman who was hired for my job before me made  more with less education and experience than me she literally made more than me for the exact same accounting job i don't think this wage gap is true you're stats are out of context of their papers that's awful science it's not even science at that point nowhere do your stats talk about women choosing responsibilities or their perceived quality of life this is click bait i'd say stahp but it makes you waaayyy too much money and you're a woman making more than many men just by making videos based on stats i don't have to cite as you don't either.,2,NOT
the video is factional and all but.. how could you miss the way race ability etc affect the wage gap latinas in the u.s make like 0 less than white women and nearly half of what white men make.. this video seems to consider white women most of all and it's even reflected in the clips of working women.,1,NOT
so men and women earn the same just that men work more time thus earn more.,2,NOT
i have five points about the wage gap  if it were really true why wouln't companies just hire all women instead of men and make an additional 9 in profits for their share holders i am sure no one would complain if a company hired all women in fact it would be celebrated as a trail blazer  do we think that every plumber the vast majority of them are men by the way in new york gets paid the exact same amount for unclogging a toilet if not there is a wage gap  why is it not your responsibility to know what you are worth and negotiate what you think is fair if you get what you think you are worth there is no wage gap if you don't know or underestimate your worth it is your problem the last time i checked indentured labor is against the law so if you are not paid what you are worth it is your responsibility to find another job that pays you a fair wage  some people both men and women will accept less than the market wage in order to compensate for their lack of experience or education it is an opportunity for them to join the workforce and prove their worth this is essential for competition keeping wages in check and giving people a chance to enter their profession of choice  what are we doing about the wage gap between blacks whites asians non-asians vegetarians non-vegetarians muslims christians or any other classification of people we can think of.,2,NOT
do you have any idea how work in a laboratory or in business works it seems like you've oversimplified it way too much to fit your hypothesis,1,NOT

butt hurt meninists attacking everyone they're even more annoying than the extreme feminists.,2,NOT
or you idiot it actually represents different choices made by men and women on average you know that thing that becomes more and more obvious the less outside forces affect outcomes it's why you idiots never talk about the scandinavian countries where the gender pay gap is most pronounced because every single fact runs counter to your dumb narrative.,3,NOT
if you read the study they misrepresented the information,1,NOT

"those images at :2 don't say women do more than men to raise kids in two parent households they show that equal plus father does more""together 47+6 outweighs mother does more 47) so in 3 of households the father is doing the same or more than the mother of course when you say mom does more 47 vs dad does more 6 it looks like dads do x less work and if you run the graphics by quickly and say that out loud while you do it adds even more to the misleading nature the only category of the three presented where mom does more is taking care of sick kid mom 4 equal 9 dad does more )  is greater than 6 that's hardly a shocking indictment of fathers everywhere then you have to make the leap from those numbers to pay when it isn't clear how that would directly translate into earnings of someone  years out of business school.",2,NOT
how does this have 00 dislikes?,1,NOT
think about this hr is the largest highest paid female-dominated job in america they know the wage data for everyone in the company how long they've worked there and their job performance they are responsible for making sure employees are treated equitably and fairly in the company to avoid labor law infractions you know like the equal pay law) if there is such thing as a wage gap you can blame hr in other words it's women keeping women down.,3,NOT

"wage gap in st world country ""exists"" companies hire all women so they spend less money stonks",2,NOT
i watched the whole thing before i consider disliking and this seems interesting it's not a blatant feminist video saying that discrimination exists against women in the work place but the video shows actual research and studies as to how the pay gap widens in strict inflexible jobs because of how women bear children.,1,NOT
men and women make different choices even that study that compares house hold chores with full time working parents doesn't take into account that while the work is considered full time the men are working insanely more hours especially when full time in these studies is pegged at 5-4 hours men routinely will work 0 hours in their jobs women value flexibility over pay this has been proven in countless surveys and studies yet vox seems to think that you should be able to have flexible hours aka not work as much but some how he paid the same there is no discrimination going on there is no social conditioning in a master patriarchal scheme to make women think they want flexible hours men and women make different choices and that's ok stop creating discontent where it is not warranted women in the west are the freest and liberated people's on the globe just stop it.,2,NOT
the major thing about the wage gap is that it is false taking the average of anything is not scientific i'll play the average game on the opposite side on average men do more overtime take less time off don't take parental leave without losing their job and are better negotiators taking the initial salary of somebody is pure bs because it's up to the employer i'm too tired of writing these to not press the shoeonhead button,2,NOT
also why does the number always change somewhere like it's  cents  cents  cents like m ake up your fuckig mind,2,NOT
conclusion there is an inequality in how men and women are paid but it isn't anywhere near as simple as people want it to be,1,NOT
equal pay act of 96 196 i can never remember which one it is) most of it comes from overtime and the fact that men ask for raises more often alongside the actual jobs.,2,NOT
where is my wage gap button! oh shoeonhead where are you!,1,NOT
the wage gap is bull women actually work less hours than men and i have evidence to support it women are most likely to get sick and take a day off so there is no gap there is just men work longer,2,NOT
the lack of flexible hours isn't the only reason why women earn less.,2,NOT
if there is one woman in america working a legal job getting paid less than a male coworker with exactly the same hours education contract time in the job etc then she can sue the pants off her employer as well as publicly humiliate them on social media doesn't really sound like a patriarchal conspiracy.,2,NOT
so the pay gap is basically between mom and others then isn't the issue when women get pregnant women have no other choice but take care of kids and work less while men have no choice but work harder if there is more support for working moms such as childcare and paternity leave this situation will be better.,1,NOT
"""mom's take care of their kids and work just like their husbands you either married a loser or should just not have kids if that bothers you.",2,NOT
i hate this channel now they went full feminist,2,NOT

what i would like to know is how many single women live on starvation pay after pension compared to single men because these women continue to pay men about 6 cdn per hour for construction for example and vehicle maintenance people about 10 an hour while most of these wealthy male pensioners can do their own work i suspect most women on pension earn about half of what men receive and therefore have serious troubles paying for food clothing medicine medical care etc in old age compared to what men have it seems no government will ever dare tally the differences in each province or state with regard to single female pensioners versus male because they don't want to admit that old men are living like kings compared to old women who in many cases are starving.,1,NOT
"you see the wage gap comes up as a really cool statistic for feminists the fact is women earn about the same in the same jobs with the same hours as their male counterparts why did i say about the same"" because men are much more likely to ask for a raise there is nothing keeping you from earning the same as the men it's simply you.. and science but that doesn't really change things)",3,NOT

this also does not discuss the fact that men with mba degrees work 0 more hours than women it also does not take into consideration the male ego vs the female ego in business the is one of the factors that contributes the need for continued exponential success in males slightly more than it does in females psychologically and physiologically men and women are different that difference is sometimes a good thing mean that females are better at certain things than males and vise versa this difference in skill can then used to run a successful business.,2,NOT

in what jobs women earn more money than man there must be some,1,NOT
another seemingly obvious point that gets overlooked all the time is how relationships are formed between men and women call it whatever you will but women usually end up dating and marrying men who earn at least as much as they do often more when you are talking about people in higher earning positions let's say 0k+ and it comes time to start a family it is often easier for the woman to take time off work or leave the work force all together when their spouse is making enough money this also has a negative affect on women taking on more work or chasing promotions which comes with more work there is no real incentive to do so when the husband is earning good money the combined income of both people earns themselves a very comfortable life style there simply isn't a need for the woman to earn more next up actually compare two people in the same exact position within an industry chase as many examples of two or more people in identical positions as possible and study the earnings gap.,2,NOT

males usually work longer then women so that explains the wage gap,2,NOT
hell yeah vox is smart again,1,NOT
i appreciated how this researched and went further into reasoning it definitely pinpoints the roots.,1,NOT
the reason men make more is because they work more hours in the same jobs the reason they work more is because they're more ambitious on average the reason for this is because men are expected to earn money and pay for dates to court women women can always fall back on marrying rich so it stunts the ambition level of the average woman there isn't much that can be done about this as the root cause of these behaviors are biological let's just accept that there will be a pay gap but it's closed when you consider the paying-for-dates gap and the fact that women control 0 of consumer spending even though men make about 0 of the income in the usa what does that last piece of data show yes that men make the majority of income but women spend it they spend men's money ask any marketing or advertiser which gender they sell to have you ever heard of a woman called a deadbeat in our culture no why is that within that answer also lies the answer to the wage gap bandeadbeat,3,NOT

can you guys make one based on race please and help me understand why the economic situation is so bad for many black communities,1,NOT
there a lots of other factors you skipped over women typically work fewer overtime hours and use more of their vacation and sick days the whole wage gap basically boils down to the choices people make and not their gender.,2,NOT
dislike because they did a great job dismantling the wage gap then said it still exists it is a minor difference that can be explained by mentality and willingness to negotiate pay not a gap perpetuated by woman-hating capitalists just a difference that occurs because of many factors factors almost entirely based on personal choice.,2,NOT
there are so many wrong logical pathways in this video email me at bmartin014a2.com so we can talk about it.,2,NOT
the factual feminist here on youtube did an entire series on why this wage gap is basically just a statistical variance in how people choose what to do with their lives women are not at all interested in dangerous dirty disgusting professions like sewage and mining and construction these do not appeal to women at all they would rather have a fun safe low-paying job than a miserable dangerous high-paying job men are the sacrificial laborers of our society and we pay them significantly more than women because of that that is also why women take on the dominant role in the household because the man is more likely to die and it mitigates the damage to the home if he does these could be socially constructed things or just pure evolutionary necessity either way the wage gap doesn't tell any of the story it's just a statistic that keeps getting repeated over and over again with no context.,3,NOT

i don't see gender so there is no wage gap.,2,NOT
the gender wage gap has been disproven a million times by a million different people including economists independent researchers and even the government the only reason that it appears this way in some studies is because the studies are not done correctly rather than look at the average pay for people working the same hours at the same job at the same company and the only variable being gender the look at the total amount of money earned by women and men in the united states which is not how you do statistics this is because it does not include the types of jobs people from the two genders are choosing for example the stem fields which pay among the highest salaries are almost solely male despite the colleges trying to convince women to go into stem for many many years the mainly female dominated industries are things like childcare cosmetics and social studies which do not pay anywhere near as much as the male dominated stem fields and other male dominated areas please stop spouting the third wave feminist nonsense as fact because it's objectively not.,2,NOT
there is wage gap because men is doing better not because of discrimination for same job experience and hours of work women gets payed same as men,2,NOT

when comparing a male and female nurse yes the male nurse is paid 8 more this is because the male has more qualifications the reason male nurses gravitate to the best paying nursing specialties work longer hours and find jobs in cities with the highest compensation aka the willing to relocate) career choices and educational differences explain most if not all the gender gap in nursing.,2,NOT

just came here to say there are only genders,5,ABU
women want the world to change to be easier and more flexible for them while men go and do their job no matter how hard it is this is the attitude that is earning you less money.,3,NOT
so they're payed the same but more men work than women because they have babies and stuff well that's good for me,2,NOT
let me show use feminist tactics to turn this around it is so unfair that women get to spend more time taking care of and influencing the small minds of the children while the man has to work disproportionally longer and offer hours at work only to bring more money home that is spent on the family there is a working and family time gape in this country and we need to stop it!!! lolwut,3,NOT

great job very well explained i see no hard manual job in those studies...wonder why,2,NOT
i wonder how many of these petulant man children in the comments actually watched the video to realise that their bickering is pointless and irrelevant to what is being presented here.,2,NOT
her vocal fry is so extreme..,1,NOT
you didn't take into account the dirty jobs like garbage collectors or high risk jobs like police or firefighter.. women don't want to do these jobs and the high salary of these jobs due to how gross and how dangerous they are make the gap bigger men are more willing to take life threatening jobs than women just because they pay more and help them support their families is also why of every  work related deaths of them are men.,2,NOT
lol than hire only women srsly guys the girls in my office are always looking to cut corners male co-workers work harder.,3,NOT
so if there's anything i got from this it's that men are lazy and leave the mothers to take care of the children so they make less money right am i right?,2,NOT
1 i love how you advocate flexible hours rather than ideally having men and women hold the same responsibilities at home because men just can't do it  but the comments section still manage to be an argument of how the problem doesn't exist . i guess it really makes sense then that my mother and her sisters make a lot more than their husbands because they work in jobs with flexible hours as a result they have to work a lot harder though.,1,NOT
wtf 00k dollars of wage omg,1,NOT
"does vox realise that its main points disproved the theory of the wage gap completely i tried to sit here for half an hour to collect counter arguments to all your points considering that people in the comments are arguing that people didn't watch the video i managed to cut it down to a few points  your statistics in a few areas only correlated to certain fields of work e.g business) this creates a misleading argument in the statement you made you also did not reveal the ratio of men women in the graduate pool so its very difficult to accurately say that men had higher salaries out the gate"" do you mean on average or in the whole what jobs did they take with what companies this doesn't account for peoples choices out of school argument looked at thousands of men and women who graduated from 99 006 men earned more out the gate""  it's a fact that many years ago women were actively payed less than men for the same jobs its completely ridiculous that you are using arguments from 97 all the way back to 948 i mean really? 948? the difference begins shrinking because of pay equality you absolute morons as they approach their 0's and 0's was moving into a time where sexism in the workplace was actively being tackled pay was becoming equal so of course the gap closed it really has nothing to do with pregnancy at this point argument :25 if you look at women born 973... same thing for women 968.. 948....  if you do want to argue pregnancy in a relationship it is two peoples choices to have a child having a child has consequences good and bad you have a child you work less to take care of that child perhaps women do take on a disproportionate share of responsibilities but it is up too the people in the relationship to decide who does what we have maternity leave for a reason for both male and females argument :10  these statistics dont take into account the actual jobs themselves its illegal to pay women less these statistics and the way you are phrasing them are misleading stop saying the word pay women aren't payed less they earn less yearly because of their choices in the job argument :45  if you dont show up for work or can't work the same hours as a man you are not going to be payed as much i dont care if your pregnant i dont care if you are lazy you dont show up you dont get payed you are contradicting yourself because it sounds like you are saying women have children which force them to have time off but we should make jobs more flexible for them if you choose a job with less flexible hours thats a choice you made society doesn't have too pander to fit your every need argument some jobs require really specific hours not available to her clients when they need her"" :30 i could go on but this is boring now your still citing statistics from the 970s to fit whatever agenda you are pushing in 017 so congratz if you wanted too prove that the wage gap only happens now because women work less hours you did it women aren't paid less than men so too call it a wage gap is totally misleading women get the same salary as man women earn less than men yearly on the whole because of their choices jobs hours etc this entire video was confusing and misleading it sounded like you were saying women are payed less then you were saying they weren't but all i took out of it was that in order to shrink the wage gap we need to make jobs more flexable for women"" the simple answer is no.",2,NOT

i don't understand why people want mothers to work and fathers to care for children there is a *reason* that these so-called gender roles have developed and it is the simple fact that men and women differ biologically women on average do a much better job with child rearing than men on the other hand men on average are willing to sacrifice almost everything for their families financial stability i've seen women throw it all away to be mothers and i've seen men throw themselves into work to support their families at the cost of rarely being with them the happiest families are those who find a happy medium but the woman should be the caregiver and the man the breadwinner that's just how it works.,2,NOT
what vox is really trying to tell is that women should get more than their male counterparts even if they are in the office or not whether they leave the office early or not present when clients need them instead they should be paid for staying home.fantastic thinking vox.,2,NOT
i can't wait to be a stay at home dad let the women do the work for a change ,2,NOT
getting there vox.,1,NOT
in other words women have more privilege flexibility and choice and can achieve a life/work balance men simply have less workplace rights and have to work more than women women don't need to work as much as men because quite often men support their partners lifestyle choices if you want the wage gap to disappear let's stop putting the responsibility on men to pay for everything and let's give them equal workplace rights paternity leave and retirement age.,2,NOT

there is no wage gap there is however an earnings gap as people who do the same job with the same credentials tend to get paid the same amount because regardless of the business owner they want to maximize profits and thus pay their employees as little as possible while still retaining more skilled individuals however if billy works  hour weeks and mandy works  hour weeks one will make more initially and be more likely to receive promotions in the future which results in better wages and thus even greater earnings down the line this is the jist of what many purposefully mislabel as the wage gap as a wage is the rate one is paid hourly not what you earn over a specific amount of time including non-work hours that is what we call earnings.,2,NOT

wage gap isent a thing comparing all the avrg of all men and all women what you actualy get is a representation of how strong the difrence between the rich and the poor is lets say 00 people from group x get to earn 00 a month another group of 0 people caled group y earn 00 aswell yet 5 of those do not have eny income and  of those have an income of 0000 now you have a group in wich the avrg earning for 0 people is 00 and 0 people in this group wherefor the avrg earning is 500 now you have an avrg of something around 10 for group y so yes on avrg group x will earn les then group y but do you realy want to be a part of group y where you have a .5 chance to end up in poverty and posibly die of starvation at the off chance of .5 where you might earn more money as you can spend on top of that you have to take into acount that those who are earning 000 a month probably are giving up the chance of a personal life starting from there 0's to there 0's now so lets say you dont want to be a part of this group that gives up everything to earn money now you are just stuck with a .75 chance to end up in poverty and a 1.25 chance to earn a living unlike the 00 chance to earn a living so you tell me would you rather be a part of group x or y i know what my answer will be i would like to be part of group x and on avrg earn les then group y this btw isent taking into acount chance of having an acident with permanent disability working conditions and all other kinds of bs u whud rather not deal with.,2,NOT

isnt wage paid according to the service you give? men are paid more in some jobs because they provide more service and customer satisfaction in these jobs so they have to earn more i think that makes sense it also explains why female models are paid more than male models the answer is simple the female models have a higher service satisfaction ratio than their male counterparts so why all the fuss? i wonder?,2,NOT

all you people dancing with joy that the wage-gap does not exist and feminists are wrong should re-think this whole situation women don't talk about this because they want the same pay for the same job cause that has been already dealth with and i mean sane women not idiots featured in buzzfeed videos reading the scripts they're given they just want equal treatment in the workplace that is the problem and the main reason why women are flagging up the disproportion in total earnings of men vs women the inequality exists because of women being expected to engage in the family life more than men that is one of the reasons imo it's the biggest factor) in today's society success is measured unfortunately but it's the truth by how much money you make and how great of a professional career you have it applies to both genders women feel like they will have a tougher time with accomplishing that kind of success than men and it is rightly so most of us men and women want to have children one day but for women having children means that their professional career will take a hit just to make this a bit more real one of my friends asked her boss why her colleague was given a promotion although she's been working for the company for a longer time she left out the fact that he's not as good at his job and the fact that he is a man she didn't expect that would be the reason and the answer was well you have two children at a young age so we thought giving you more responsibility right now could be damaging to your private life fun fact the guy also has two children at a very similar age of course my friend left that company thank god obviously that inequality is not men's or women's fault it's how our society is built but we should look at possibilities of dealing with that problem as increasingly women are just giving up having children completely the ageing society is already a huge issue that is progressing something needs to be done and as of now there are many people again both male and female that are not even acknowledging that the problem exists wake up people i tried to stress that no one who is a sane human being is blaming men for this it's not all of the men of this planet that should get together to fix this it's a problem of the society as a whole and we should try to deal with it that's all.,1,NOT

i have many female friends who chose to get into different fields and made the same money as men the problem is they fall in love and want to have kids they get emotionally attached as a mother and take breaks which forces them to either stay in current position or take a break from their current job while the men who still shoulder most of the expenses continue to compete for higher wages which makes it appear men make more then women on average the simple truth is it is life choice decisions that affect income on the opposite end of the spectrum i have seen female coworkers who are extremely career oriented and they make higher income in higher positions then other men because they don't care about having kids or have a male partner who works in a lower paying position and is the house husband it all comes down to choices but feminists and gender inequality advocates don't want to hear that also evidence shows that men on average don't live as long as women so go figure.,2,NOT

i dont really think there is a wage gap in the way people think i think men earn their increased pay compared to a woman unless it's an exceptional case of a boss or manager who is truly sexist but...there is a deeper problem women are led to believe they are weaker too emotional and too volatile all their lives women don't just compete against men but they also compete against women lots of women in power seem to see themselves as an exception and supporting another woman is threatening to their perceived special position as a woman so the wage gap ends up being because women are not striving as high as men but a lot of it is because of psychological manipulation to believe they arent good enough.,1,NOT

the wage gap doesn't exist though.,2,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap white women make much closer salary to men while latina and black women make much much lower on the dollar and asian women usually make close to or higher than white women any discussion of the gender pay gap that ignores race is incomplete at best,1,NOT
now i know why people say i shouldn't look at the comments.,1,NOT
what about trans genders?,1,NOT
it's insane how many stupid people watched this video and missed the entire point it really is sad.,2,NOT
why focus in the fact that women need to have jobs with schedule flexibility? man can increase their contribution with children too!!,1,NOT
statistics on wage gaps are almost usually manpliated to make it look like its a real thing but the reality is that when you put all the factors in and not just add the occupancies and wage per hour you can make a clear deduction that the gender wage gap is in fact horse manure and on par with the flat earthers who believe the earth is flat.,2,NOT
interesting video but it neglected to mention that men typically work longer hours and are as a group more economically productive over the course of their lives this means they contribute more to maintaining social systems than they get out of them because they pay more taxes so things basically even out in the end.,2,NOT
the wage gap doesn't exist,2,NOT
honestly what bothers me is treating the men as the bad guy in this statistic i mean the use the fact a lot of women want to have kids as the big reason for the gap or the fact many women would just stay home with the kids however there is sth that doesn't get adressed mainly . well if a woman stays home who do you think needs to earn more to support that yeah a man i swear it like this statistic tries to frame men as these greedy bastards cheating women out of their money but.. if the woman stays home with kids that leaves the man responsible to earn money for that woman with kids so this horrible image of a man cheating woman out of her money is in fact earning money for the family why is this never brought up?,2,NOT
i found a solution to all of this men will help close the wage gap and women a keep the thigh gap problem solve.,3,NOT
she is talking about an earnings gap not a wage gap,1,NOT
damn i though i was going to be able to tear some hippie liberal bullshit apart after watching this video but you proved me wrong this video is extremely fair and balanced unlike most other vox videos hopefully they will stick to videos following this format and not regress.,1,NOT
make a feminism joke plz!!!!!,2,NOT
video came out minutes ago and people already disliked.,1,NOT
also people in the comments blaming the women for choosing to have children are missing the point it takes two to make a baby yet our society deems it to be the women's responsibility to raise the baby causing them to be seen as less reliable workers it is discrimination and sexism exploring the roots and causes of sexism does not disprove that sexism exists expanding your world view will help you realize that people face discrimination that you can't understand and you should try to empathize in order to fight it.,1,NOT
men are wired to be vicious aggressive protective that is how humans survive thousands of years ago with those sabertooth tigers lurking just outside your backyard apply those alpha male traits in the business and you get those male dominated ceos in business the big boss cannot wink fold and be weak otherwise the competitors and even business partners will eat him/her alive testosterone makes a big difference as well.,3,NOT
the main reasons there's a wage gap between men and women  women have more paid time off work compared to men when they have children this creates a debt to the companies that pay them  more women leave work or reduce their hours to spend more time in a homemaker role compared to men making it difficult for firms to earn back the extra debt that women create compared to men meaning that women are taxed as a gender to pay back the debt that is created by the entire gender which is also why the wage gap closes towards their later years because they can put more time into work instead of homemaking)  men are more competitive and aggressive due to our naturally higher testosterone levels which means men are more likely to take risks apply for the higher paid jobs more productive in highly stressful work environments more likely to have the skills for senior level positions and are wayyy better at asking and negotiating pay rises not saying women can't do these things just a higher proportion of men are capable of it than women).,2,NOT
i can't stand these comments though if this happens to be one of the first you see don't scroll any further.,1,NOT
i don't care how small the gap is as long as there is a gap we aren't done,1,NOT
my husband went to work while i stayed home how dare he wage gap me wagegapmetoo,2,NOT
who makes 00k!?,1,NOT
people see a set of data notice an inequality and immediately scream sexism what they miss is that the wages are exactly the same between genders but men usually work longer hours than women.,2,NOT
can't believe vox made a video like this,1,NOT
if a man makes 400k and a woman makes 250k that's not 0 less that's 7.5 less maybe the gap can be partly explained by men being better at arithmetic and english.),2,NOT
is someone willing to talk to me about why it is hard for some ladies to understand that there will be the wage gap for men tend to take risks and the jobs that go along with the risks are rewarded with a higher pay if majority of women do the jobs that are secretarial oriented they shouldn't expect to be paid more or equal to the man climbing a 5ft tree or digging out sewers and of course you forget the electricians who have to work themselves through the wires and some get electrocuted therefore women and men can not make the same because men tend to go for the jobs which are high end risky and jobs that involve a lot of mental capacity put into them and men do very good at them that's my take on the issue.,2,NOT
yes the wage gap seems real and this video makes a good explanation that the women usually spend more time on the children thus they would get less money for work with specific hours but i dont get how this is that big of a problem as some people make it out to be when most women with children also have a husband who can use that extra money he makes to support the whole family.,2,NOT
hot take from vox mothers do more mothering stop the press!,2,NOT
how about man take on the same number of household chores than woman that way they are both equally affected by non-flexible hours seems easier and more natural than forcing every job to a flexible schedule.,1,NOT
women are typically higher in agreeableness and being agreeable doesn't normally work well in business,2,NOT
what are you even talking about here what economists what happens in mid-30s to 0s women child rearing surveys i know you mentioned a woman from harvard...bravo still doesn't explain not only whatever your point actually is but you essentially explain away not counter any so-called gap pharmacists what btw simply saying the research means nothing good grief thanks for nothing.,2,NOT
i'm so happy for trisha!,1,NOT
i guess the wage gap as represented here not caused by active discrimination but work time choices does exist between the sexes i just don't understand why it is always put into the perspective of sexist discrimination i wouldn't deny there to be still some issues with that but just concentrating on this factual wage gap here i do not see why it is seen as such an important cause to close it by force) as presented here it seems that the wage gap is mainly caused by the division of parenting tasks partners choose in which women still often do more of the unpaid work at home and therefore earn less careerwise surely our society will change so i guess work at home will be seperated more equally and i don't think this is a bad trend as it promotes egalitarian principles and so on this however is a cultural issue as this wage gap is mainly based on this choices and not structual discrimination it's comparable with the single mom single dad ratio maybe yes there are essentially more single moms than dads and maybe it would be nicer to have this more equally but it is not due to discrimination of men but rather because of the still existing sex models children stay with their moms so it would be nice to dicuss this topics without always putting things as discriminative.,2,NOT
show me company in the us that pay men more than woman for the same job and i will stop saying that feminists are liars and i will donate every year to any lying fembots out there just  in 018 that pay men more than woman.,2,NOT
so u r trying to find out how make as much as money while working less... awesome. count me in,2,NOT
mayb if u stop bla bla bla and start working harder it wouldn't be the case.,2,NOT
and most of these people researching this are wait for shocker its women,1,NOT
my ears are bleeding.,2,NOT
i cant believe there are still idiots believing this bullshit we have already debunked this myth,2,NOT
i can see how in some cases its unfair and unreasonable for there to be a gap.. however there are other reasons for it reasons im not gonna write an essay for but lets say alimony that seemingly only men get stuck with or in a good majority where the man is the main bred winner and the wife is doing it as a way for a few extra or a way to get out of the house it can be similar to how a single mom gets special social treatment vs a single dad i.e the mom needs money to help get a car fixed the sympathy is real but when a single dad needs to get money for a car he tends to be left to his own devices but hey im a white male millennial and we are apparently the problem to some people so what do i know.,2,NOT
if a woman did the same job as me from day one and worked the same hours and we both had promotions at the same time she would earn the same as me end of talking generally is irrelevant and there will always be a difference in earnings much like there will always be a difference in time taken out of the workplace and time spent shopping for clothes it all comes down to a difference in life decisions which is evident between men and women peoples decisions are neither right or wrong nor good or bad but either way they will affect statistics.,2,NOT
so because i work  hours and my sister works  hours i'm an evil person because i make more?,2,NOT
oh no facts as a feminist i need to ignore so i can continue my agenda!,2,NOT
girl. howwww you gon make this video and not be intersectional and not mention that it's the white woman who makes  to the white man's dollar this video flops,1,NOT
simple way to get rid of the wage cap change your major from liberal arts to engineering.,2,NOT
this was almost a good video almost the points were good but you can't keep saying wage gap when you are so clearly explaining an earnings gap.,2,NOT
the one glaring issue with the wage gap hoax never addressed,2,NOT
hahahah the feminist narrative of wage gap is slowly falling apart thank god this lie has limited time left..... for vox this was actually a pretty fair video they touch on the main topics of why women on average earn less.,2,NOT
"more people should be listening to christina hoff sommers on this topic not milo yiannoupoulis she says brilliant things without feeling the need to bring every ounce of attention to herself ruining the legitimacy of her arguments with the inflammatory nature of her ego which is what milo does guess what dude when you say things like if women had been the predominant gender in the world throughout history instead of men we'd all still be living in grass huts."" you aren't really going to get very far in an argument about equality.",1,NOT
well over 0 of work place deaths are men now let me ask you should there be a earnings gap or not?,2,NOT
if i could pay a woman 1 less to do same amount of work as a man then all men would be unemployed end of story.,2,NOT
fun fact wage gap doesn't exist,2,NOT
the incredible thing about this video is that it promotes making hours more flexible to accomodate mothers needs but never questions the basic premise that it is up to women to take hours away from work to look after the kids i'm deeply disappointed vox.. furthermore why does your only solution seem to be in the increasing liberalization and deregulation of businesses like pharmacies is this really the only way forward ,2,NOT
"i respect this video much more than others covering the issue which typically makes my blood boil) the reason being that instead of making a victimizing video bout how woman are so oppressed"" she attacks the issue by looking in to why it is that women tend to have lower salaries and its not because employers are paying less just because you are a woman its because most women bear children and mothers tend to their babies you can't be the best at work and have a all the time most people want in their families.",1,NOT
it's simple the wage gap doesn't exist why because if it did then companies left and right would be hiring females exclusively to save 1 of money from paying their worker's income meaning that rather paying a good number of their male workers 1 they'd have to pay their all-female workers .79 saving that extra .21 it doesn't take extensive research nor rocket science to debunk the wage gap myth however the point about women being also busy at home and how it relates to their wage is also a good example of why women also earn less in jobs than men great video!,2,NOT
the outright denial of reality that some people show in these comments is disturbing.,2,NOT
is there a gap in these fields i don't think these were studied bricklayers roofers aircraft mechanics plumbers road surface repair workers heavy equipment operators hazardous waste disposal technicians compressed gas delivery techs pallet jack operations tree trimmer/climbers firefighters chemical processors dockworkers drillers explosives handlers petro yardworkers pipefitters field laborers power generation containment cable riggers forklift operators for hazardous materials hvac service technicians fiber optic installers toolmakers lathe operators underground construction crewmembers coal miners loaders/unloaders fuel station monitors utility maintenance techs welders window installers yard laborers elevated concrete laborers wastewater treatment operators machinists truckloaders iron workers bridge iron workers tunnel iron workers elevated construction ironworkers rebar structural these are all fields that are overwhelmingly male and this is hardly a comprehensive list i get the distinct impression that nothing hazardous or dangerous ever comes up when discussing this fictional gap because in the west women have it so good they retain the luxury of not even having to think about jobs that can kill them in this issue i'm suspicious that is the case when the gap comes up hazardous jobs are never mentioned show less,2,NOT
vox this is why i love you,1,NOT
ughhh vox was so close to admitting the wage gap doesn't really exist for sexist reasons so close.,2,NOT
wage gap is  cents on the dollar within the margin of error,1,NOT
this is a wonderful video can we get it more views that any of stupid lacy greens videos?!,1,NOT
so work less get paid less hmmmm....,1,NOT
well doesn't that show that the wage gap is not based oh discrimination just job choice and different hours,2,NOT
5:0 ice cream taster sign me up.,1,NOT
if women want to close the wage gap become educated in more valuable vocations work as many hours as the highest earning men and don't have children just like how men have no guarantee to have children it's solved now do it and stop complaining.,2,NOT
it's still an indiviual problem if you get less money it's because you earn less it dosen't matter what your gender is,2,NOT
this gives the information that is needed i am glad that for once vox has given some context to this subject with this proof that they understand the reasons i don't know how you can claim that there is something insidious behind this phenomenon.,1,NOT
women are choosing to raise children and that's what is increasing the gap so it's their fault yeah ill believe that when paid paternity leave is a thing i guarantee most women who choose to leave their jobs because of giving birth do it because the husband can't get paternity leave make paternity leave a thing and i guarantee the gender wage gap will decrease right now american society basically forces women to leave their jobs unless they already have enough money for private child care and most don't,1,NOT
this conveniently leaves off how men often are demanded of higher hours more risks more time away from family etc the parts where you complain about woman taking more household roles and losing hours tends to be where the men of the family pick up extra hours and more responsibility at work the messed up part is often time woman expect men to do this in families so the men start making way more than the woman and then when there is an apparent pay gap this kind of video gets made saying oh the poor woman are getting paid less! complain all you want it's just simple woman do less and get paid less and men are being worked to death for that higher pay maybe sometime vox should do something about how men are getting shafted by this trend too,2,NOT
it's not factually correct if you have to give so much context it's far less deceiving to say that men and women make the same amount per hour on the same job whoops that's wrong too women are being paid more in some jobs on that equivalent scale now but i'm glad vox gave context even if the video still keeps saying wage gap when there is none when you factor in everything.,2,NOT
the devisive thing that people put upon these statistics is that the descriptor and defining factor of wage gap is gender which is completely unfounded this video helps denote that there are so many factors that create such gaps they are logical and make total sense just based on the structure of society.,2,NOT
this is correct very good explanation vox but.. don't call it a wage gap because it's an earnings gap two different things.,1,NOT
i would watch the whole video or consider it relevant if it wasn't a woman talking,5,ABU
anyone else annoyed by the way she ends every sentence?,3,NOT
if there are  genders what wage gap are we talking about?,3,NOT
no one mentions the gender spend gap women love to shop and flash hubby s credit cards while hubby is slogging his guts out at work.,3,NOT
female that's a feminist in the raf because they want to enforce equality oh my god this is madness i just joined and i'm already noticing wage issues i'm being paid much less than that flight lieutenant whose been in for  years,2,NOT
"most women go to college,most men don't go to college it take a lot to go to college then you're in debt",2,NOT
the weaknesses of the video are as follows they still insinuated that discrimination was a factor as they failed to mention otherwise they didn't talk about wage negotiation they neglected to mention that most women choose to raise children and yes there are studies that give a clear indication that both men and women prefer this to working so it is indeed a privilege for women to do so) and perhaps most importantly they failed to mention that these industry-specific differences are literally everything to do with specialisation and earned promotion.,2,NOT
jesus it's so painful to listen to her vocal fry!,2,NOT
you'll get paid the same if you do as good a job,2,NOT
this is a very simple explanation of the wage gap i had a hard time understanding before but i can see now how it does exist.,1,NOT
good informative video i think something that wasn't mentioned that could affect a women's wage is the likelihood of them taking time off or quiting their job all together i think men get paid more because they are much less likely to be out of work for children for maternity leave from a company's point of view it's just more reliable to pick a man to do the job and in a general sense they are a more financially sound choice.,1,NOT
feminism is bullshit in my opinion,2,NOT
tl;dr it's not unequal pay for equal work,2,NOT
so sad that women putting children first is now considered an inconvenience and a burden but it does explain part of why the country is getting so messed up.,2,NOT
the wage gap doesn't exist,2,NOT
there is no wage gap due to sexism if you work hard enough youll make the same,2,NOT
wage gap is more fictional than the sword of sharnana,2,NOT
that footage got lost from both sides maybe a meat industry paid spy stole it.,2,NOT
i go through periods of subscribing unsubscribing and resubscribing to you... just resubscribed i don't agree with a lot of your motives which is more on me than you due to my severe ed background and mental health activism so any type of video commentary on another's body sets me off) still i always wind up coming back to you because there really is such a sweetness and kindness that just radiates from you.. i really believe that this is why so many people watch you you're the kind of person that just draws people in i think it would be cool to make a video on junkier vegan foods and/or meat alternatives for trisha i know the goal is partly health but i really believe that if she is exposed to just how many delicious vegan chips and pastries and whatever are out there she may begin to see just how sustainable and restrictive veganism is just a thought  3,1,NOT
thats awesome finally!,1,NOT

i think some people need to chill trisha is doing something huge by trying out a vegan diet for weeks it's a great way to start at the end of two weeks she'll feel so much better than she does now and if she isn't full on vegan after those two weeks i'm willing to bet she'll eat more plant based which is still more moral we'll see what happens!,1,NOT

this is awesome i remember trish saying in one of shane's videos that she didn't like animals and didn't care what happened to them so her ethical reason was very surprising to me i really hope that she can make it work but at least now she's beginning to see the truth and the benifits.,1,NOT
i really want to go vegan but my parents won't let me.. and i try to avoid animal products as much as i can because every time i eat animal products i feel like i'm gonna vomit üò©,1,NOT

how can having hair on your lip mean you as a kid look like a man a female child cant look like a man..boy..maybe..man..no,2,NOT
okay trisha you identify as a female you literally said you identify as your natural-born gender which is female shut the fuck up with your transphobic bullshit oh no you had to wear sports bras  bitch shut up that doesn't make you trans at all you're a tomboy you literally have no dysphoria you have your fucking tits out the entire fucking time you have more male characteristics oh you don't wanna be the center of attention that doesnt fucking make you trans girls don't have to wear makeup or do their hair to be a girl i'm a trans guy and i fucking hate this video so much just because you're into gay guys doesn't make you a guy let me say this again you are not a man so many people have opposite sex envy and they aren't trans i'm sure a lot of girls especially ones going through puberty envy men because it'll make their life easier that's not what dysphoria is dysphoria is not opposite sex envy dysphoria is wanting the opposite sex because itll match their gender gender dysphoria is a legitimate mental thing genderfluid doesn't exist some gay men date ftm people and don't have a problem with having sex with them despite their female parts because they don't have gynophobia some gay men do have gynophobia but that's not my point my point is that you are not transgender you are a cisgender female coming from a real trans guy you experience little to no gender dysphoria i apologize for being so rude i'm normally not and i normally try to have a rational and respectful conversation but i'm so pissed at this a lot of people don't like their given name not all of them are trans you really need to get the idea that you're even remotely considering being trans you were happy with short hair because you don't like the responsibility of having long hair most real trans guys want short hair because that's typically masculine masculinity does not equal male femininity does not equal female you can be a feminine boy or a masculine girl your attraction does not have anything to do with your gender/identity unless your attraction to men being ftm but not knowing makes you feel gay or vice versa that would be the only instance that attraction affects identity when you're trans ftm you don't have a male side' because you are male you are not male you are not a gay man seriously don't identify as trans or come out unless you've seen a licensed gender therapist and have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria yes you actually have to be diagnosed in most places you need an official diagnosis to go on hormones or just medically transition in any way but of course you can't medically transition because you'll just develop dysphoria because you're transitioning to something that you think you want/are but really you don't/aren't please spare yourself the time energy hate and dysphoria and shut up get the idea out of your head that you're even remotely trans please.,5,ABU
why can't u just be a girl that likes gay guys and big butts on girls i don't see a problem there.,2,NOT

there's a huge difference in acting masculine and being more comfortable with men and being trans this is glamorizing being trans who go through actually social and mental dysphoria this is taking one of the dudes too far trish i think your confusing attraction and personality with being trans.,2,NOT
i've supported you through a lot of stupid shit but you lost me with this. please educate yourself you're about to get dragged.,2,NOT
sooooooo you're a tomboy i think society has worn you down with you have to do your hair and makeup to look decent to the point where you just want to be you which i understand but to say you're transgender because you don't want to do your hair and makeup is insane.,1,NOT
please see a doctor who can help you,2,NOT
i don't know why you're all so shook the other month she was an opiate addict and somehow made an overnight recovery from withdrawal tomorrow she will probably say that she's related to the queen and that she had an incest relationship with prince harry.,2,NOT

gender fluid definitely not transgender i'm sorry,1,NOT

what that feeling is called is wanting views money and controversy this so awful to people who are really deeply struggling with actually transitioning.,2,NOT
i feel like she just has a borderline dissociative disorder where she's kinda created a male alter but still has somewhat of a grip on her female original identity sense of reality,2,NOT
how to you offend an entire community from your title to your thumbnail to the first second of your video to the last and then say i don't want people to be offended b*tch what????????,2,NOT
jesus fucking christ wtf,3,NOT

i have never been so confused in my life what the actual hell is going on.,2,NOT
what your describing doesn't sound like trans at all sounds more like gender nonconforming or non-binary,1,NOT
you know what i would call this a tom boy somtimes and a girl girl sometimes because what i heard was you like man hair and being a little more guy ish but maybe that's just me i hope you can figure it out t i really hope you find someone you care about and they care and except you ‚ù§Ô∏è,1,NOT
0:0 :01  guys what is up,1,NOT
well if you feel girly some days and like a boy other days then you might be genderfluid basically how i can explain it is sometimes you feel like a girl and other times you feel like a boy,1,NOT
"""i didnt like getting attention from adults as a child so im trans""",1,NOT
so your basically non binary,1,NOT
ok i think its safe to say that she is 000 not going to therapy anymore get back on the couch youre not trans youre just an idiot with a drug addiction and a go pro!! and that everyone is a dangerous combination,5,ABU
someone should let her go on t and see how she reacts to being a real man,2,NOT
love you girl hope you can figure out what you feel in yourself soon.,1,NOT

y'all i'm confused ,1,NOT
she has too much time on her hands,2,NOT
u can be female and still be a tomboy that doesn't make you a man..,2,NOT

second hand retardation hitting me hard rn,3,NOT
maybe you have body dysmorphia you're tomboy or you're androgynous.,1,NOT
as a trans guy myself i think there's a huge difference than being trans and not really feeling like a woman i personally can't speak on your feelings but j think you need to do you reserch so many people who think they're trans but aren't because of other issues that they believe could be fixed my being different gender for instance you being attracted to gay men doesn't mean your a gay guy you just happened to be attracted to some of the qualities they have i think that it's awesome to try out new pronouns and to experiment but i don't believe in just going straight in and coming out as a trans guys i think one thing for me that really makes me confused about this is the fact that you've gotten multiple breast jobs to enhance your boobs as a trans guy that would absolutely kill me you can obviously do whatever you want and i hope you well in your transition but i think you need to do way more reserch and figure out if you want to become a man not just a drag queen.,1,NOT
sorry to say but a person who uses they/them pronouns are called non binary people i am a non binary person my self and i appreciate people to use my correct pronouns,1,NOT

actually fuck yourself you're female in every single way you are not trans you do not have gender dysphoria i am so insulted by this as a real transgender man you have zero masculinity which is needed to be female to male ask a doctor educated on the human brain or gender identities and they will say you are born with a male or female brain you were born with a female brain and everyone sees that you are far too old to be doing this shit with the amount of people who know you it is so wrong to be posting this it is wrong to allow anyone to think being transgender is even  a choice jesus please delete your channel,5,ABU

clout chaser you called yourself a chicken nugget and a telly tubby ill believe it when i fucking see it,3,NOT
this is the first time that i can't tell if she's trolling or being serious wanting to identify as both isn't trans hun this sounds more like gender fluid or nonbinary if this is how you truly feel or you can just be a tomboy who likes pink i'm a tomboy who likes girly things at times idk i just don't wanna put anything in your head you have to sit down with yourself and really think about it this is your own journey and you need to figure it out yourself.,1,NOT
trisha i hate this sexist society title i am transgender,1,NOT
why does she always look like she's on the verge of a metal break down before these videos she's for sure on some drugs,2,NOT

wouldn't this just be androgynous or non-binary?,1,NOT
‚Äòi wear sports bras to flatten my chest trisha i wanna look fake with huge tits also trisha,2,NOT
you need to seriously educate yourself before making a video like this unless you have dysphoria you are not transgender not all transgender people got through the whole transition...meaning surgery most can socially and hormonally transition and that is enough you need therapy and education you are offending true transgender people by saying you are 00 female and ok yet are transgender this is a joke you don't have dysphoria therefore you are not transgender.,2,NOT
trish i love you but i don't think your transgender or whatever like you said you have male energy sometimes just like other women do not all women are girly girls just be trish,1,NOT
i think i got what u got boo!,1,NOT
we do not claim her!,2,NOT
kalvin garrah where you at?,1,NOT
"so obviously someone's gender identity is not something i can decide for them so i generally give people the benefit of the doubt now if they had said something along the lines of i'm a demiperson and not i like feminine guys lolz obviously i'm a gay man, it would have maybe made sense as it is i'm losing more and more brain cells by the second watching this",2,NOT
so she's gender fluid???,1,NOT
she doesnt like attention fjcjishfhdjsjd,1,NOT
dumb as fuck,5,ABU
though as a member of the lgbt i was very offended by this video i think it's truly immoral to be so negative towards trish i hope to god that she isn't trolling we are all aware of the strength it takes to come out as trans so if this is who trish really is then instead of shaming we should be taking this opportunity to educate and explain why what was said in this video is erroneous i would also recommend finding a new gender therapist.. if the concept of dysphoria hasn't come up in conversation or the fact that drag queen or gay isn't on the gender spectrum then perhaps that is contributing to the confusion good luck on your journey trish,1,NOT
wait what i mean i support trish in whatever trish wants i hope this brings you happiness!!,1,NOT
doesn't like makeup guess i'm a guy i-,1,NOT
trish i love you but i think you're just confused if you actually do feel this way then just give it time to be sure,1,NOT
i understand this completely if you don't understand don't shun her it's not her fault if you can't rap your head around it.,1,NOT
i think gender fluid might be something you should research a bit not saying your current label is wrong or anything just sounds like similar to what you are explaining,1,NOT
is born a female turns into a male turns back into a female god ,2,NOT
this is soooooo wrong take this down,2,NOT
trisha your description sounds like a non-binary person to me,1,NOT
tbh me trying to understand how i feel about my life.,1,NOT
i'm female but i have a lot of guy friends cuss a lot and i like to tell dirty jokes does that mean i'm trans? foh she's crazy she seems to be pretty comfortable in her own skin.,2,NOT
wtf is up with you,2,NOT
i can't believe this bitch got a mermaids ad but actually dysphoric and transition trans youtubers don't get ads,5,ABU
what the actual fuck is wrong with you you have crossed into waters that you need to back track real quick out of this whole video is a fucking mess your explaining is a mess trans people are not confused but by god you are you put on a wig for a week and like gay men so now your suddenly saying your trans?? what the fuck trisha you explained being gender fluid you clearly have some more thinking to do fuck am i and most likely the rest of the community highly offended by this complete and utter bullshit.,5,ABU
don't know why i'm here but i can't stop watching this train wreck üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,2,NOT
someone......please make it make sense!!!!ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶,1,NOT
trish all u said are personality traits enjoying glam stuff doesn't make you a girl or a boy it's just you being you.,1,NOT
i think shes trying to explain non-binary?,1,NOT
‚Äúi love the trans community gee thanks cause now this video makes us look bad ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞,2,NOT
okay but think about ur future partner if you wanna date a straight guy and they get confused about ur gender and you tell them that then they'll get very confused and it might not work out,2,NOT
this is offensive honestly offensive you can be a dominant masculine female and not be trans you need to be educated on what the fuck dysphoria is before you start to claim you have it in reality you do not you don't know how it feels to be trapped in the wrong body you only know how it feels to be teased for being more masculine and accepting that you are your attraction to gay guys has nothing to do with you being trans that's a fetish you are obviously confused and please go talk to a therapist or maybe kalvin garrah because he knows his shit you need to be educated you do not know your facts or what you're talking about.,2,NOT
oh honey no.. please please please educate yourself before making a public video if you really are trans than i support you 00 but you really need to get your facts straight first maybe seek some council from the trans community i hope your prepared for some major backlash from this video hun not judging or bullying...just trying to warn ya...,2,NOT
so your gender fluid,1,NOT
the language u use to describe relationships with trans people is really problematic i believe u when you say you are trans but please learn some more things and try to not just talk about this stuff in an improvised fashion a lot of your gender theory is based around traditional gender roles which is exactly what being trans is not about look into genderfluid and genderqueer identities please talk to more trans people.,1,NOT
everyone is hating and the only reason i watched this is because my friend was hating on it but i feel like i relate to this so much i love you t.,1,NOT
üòêyou're such a joke,2,NOT
as someone who is transgender i think you are confusing being ftm transgender with thinking that life would be easier as a man there's a big difference you need to go see a therapist to work through these feelings rather than sharing it on social media.,1,NOT
the little tiny shred of respect i had for her was just destroyed wtf is wrong with her,2,NOT
tbh she could've just done a mukbang and then just poked about this and then never really talked about it again,1,NOT
everyone disliked that,2,NOT
this was handled so disrespectfully? coming from a trans person doesn't mean trish has to be cis but this was not handled respectfully jesus,2,NOT
i think i actually understand you not saying that i relate but i understand what you are trying to say t(rish) what you're talking about is called gender fluidity you can be gender fluid it sounds like you are just learning and exploring about this so embrace your gender fluidity and learn more about it you have a lot to learn before you can not offend anyone please continue to educate yourself.,1,NOT
t or trish u do u why are people hating when it doesn't affect their lives unsubscribe if it's that big of a deal hope your having a great tour,1,NOT
oh no honey,1,NOT
"i'm confused,is she female or male i don't understand",1,NOT
im gay most of my friends are gay hella accepting but... damn maybe she just worded this horribly wrong,2,NOT
12:2 ... take your own advice.,1,NOT
to be any gender on any day is basically being gender fluid i'm personally gender fluid and i go by he/him they/them pronouns but i don't identify as transgender if anything i acknowledge that sometimes being fluid feels like i'm constantly transitioning because i don't have a fixed gender but i am not trans its just some food for thought but i support you wanting to express your masculinity and whatever way that may be.,1,NOT
damn tryna get attention dont even know wtf she says cause the things she say dont make sense at all ,2,NOT
based on the things that she says in this video i believe that she may be genderqueer in some way however this video is in very poor taste and incredibly poorly-informed i really wish she had handled it better especially since she has the responsibility of having a platform.,2,NOT
i'm not even a trans but this feels too offensive to me.,1,NOT
this video is hella problematic transphobic homophobic the whole shebang.,1,NOT

as a trans man fuck you.,5,ABU
being vegan for and a half years best years of my life never turn back let's save our planet thank you for such a great film!,1,NOT
so if i understand correctly because you don't wear a lot of makeup in real life and you're not overly feminine you're a guy 3:00-3:47 you are not a male because you do not identify with femininity/female gender roles female societal expectations and saying otherwise is crazy harmful gender / sex honestly the more i think about it the more i'm realising radical feminists have the right idea when it comes to understanding sex/gender if you identify with a gender that's different to your own so in this case masculinity instead of femininity you should work to dismantle gender norms to make it so a female can do traditionally masculine things like....not wearing makeup without it being weird your sex and identity aren't the problem and you shouldn't work on changing either so it matches whatever gender roles you want to follow again the implications of doing this are crazy i don't understand why a right winger saying females makeup is sexist but somehow wrapping the same talking point in leftist mumbo jumbo is all of a sudden progressive.or take use another example you gave i feel male because im assertive' progressive i'm not even mad at you trish we live in a society that's so binary that its very normal to feel the way you feel but i hope you realise soon that you are not a male just because you don't 0 percent behave the way you are expected to as a female you're just normal no-one identifies with their gender/gender roles 0 percent edit:i've just finished the vid and i think the issue here is that the female form is very sexualised by the male gaze and i think in many ways presenting as a male short hair binding wearing baggy clohes is a way for you to evade that very sexualised perception of your self by men the freedom you feel by presenting as a man makes sense as you've said males are free from the expectation to wear makeup we don't have to do our hair we don't get looked at it or hit on by weird sleazy dudes sending you lots of love it probably isn't at all to feel what you're feeling and i hope all the people attacking you take a step back and realise how normal it is for you to feel the way you feel as a woman in society like ours.the male gaze is toxic af.,2,NOT
oh my god shut the fuck up delete this.,3,NOT
this is just offensive to everything lol,2,NOT
is... is this real...?,2,NOT
‚Äúi'm a gay guy because i'm attracted to gay guys so if a gay guy is attracted to a straight guy is he a straight girl?,2,NOT
only came to dislike,2,NOT
ok im not even halfway through the video yet and i already know that you're just lost and very very confused which is okay i was confused about being trans at the beginning too so i don't wanna jump to conclusions and just criticize you now i just really think you should do a little more research on the matter maybe talking to some trans people as well and see where it goes and how you feel about all of it you know good luck,1,NOT
trisha:has a boy haircut in her music vid nobody trisha i am non binary transgender drag queen male,2,NOT

this aint it sis,2,NOT
im so sorry you have to deal with all this hate youtube is vicious and im sorry they'll never understand you t sexuality and gender is more fluid than you think it's okay to explore yourself to try on different labels or even give them up entirely i wish this world was more accepting of differences and nonconformity but its just not and whoever reads this i don't care what youve seen or how you've justified your actions you can't say with honesty that hate and making fun is a good thing belittling someone when theyre pouring out their soul no matter how foolish you think it sounds is a good thing making not only t but other viewers who are struggling with their own identity feel like absolute crap is a good thing when you spread hate and intolerance into this world its on you thats your fault thats your soul being chipped away at and i hope one day you can overcome your mistakes and spread positivity instead.,2,NOT
i'm more confused watching this than she is with her identity,2,NOT
remember when she identified as a chicken nugget,2,NOT
i think i get what ur saying like u feel like a feminine man and that fine i honestly think most of the people are giving u crap cause they don't understand you and no one really understands someone elses dysphoria and them wanting to transition i support you amd i really hope you find your true self without all the hate cause you really don't need thatüíôüíú good luck t!,1,NOT

i'm happy for you ,1,NOT
i'm confused she says that she was born a female but she identifies as a boy but she looks completely like a girl,2,NOT
i think everyone should just stop saying anything in the comments ya the video is complicated af but she's also human and she should be able to call her self identity or think of her self as anything and should be able to feel comfortable saying anything when it's talking about her mental state of mind we support anyone else in the world when it comes to these kinds of things so why can we not support her ya she's know for a lot of scandals online but that shouldn't effect you're output on anyone when it comes to there feelings.,1,NOT

the fact that she made an apology video but left this up shows that she isn't sorry at all the fucked up part is i really don't think she has bad intentions i think she is just self-sabotaging self-involved and socially unaware but the road to hell is paved with good intentions and even if she somehow justified this in her mind as meaning no harm there is no excuse for ignorance of this level this video is just so tone deaf it gives me a headache and i truly hope she figures herself out off camera ,2,NOT
my theory is either she doesnt feel like shes getting enough attention or her self esteem issues are so intense that shes beyond confused,2,NOT
so i saw a video were she said she didn't believe egipt was a real place like? she really is very stupid geez,3,NOT

here after the did video my first reaction after watching both videos and after not watching any of her videos in yeaaaarrrs is what the actual fuck...but honestly this makes me so sad there is obviously something really wrong with her she has absolutely no idea who she is or where she belongs and this in it self is a problem most likely started when she was a child as much as we all want to hate on her the poor girl is literally losing her mind in front of millions and making millions in the process it's a vicious and unfulfilling circle and i hope the people who actually care for her will keep an eye on her.,2,NOT
anyone else just hate her lips but can't stop looking at them?,3,NOT
as an ftm gay man who is also a drag queen this is one of the most offensive things i've ever seen.,2,NOT
i'm a trans male and this is some fucking bullshit fuck outta here,2,NOT
yall i loved her video but this sounds like some tucute shit.,2,NOT
i am a very open minded individual but this video confused the heck out of me,1,NOT

"""i don't like being the center of attention isn't that literally her brand?????",2,NOT
wow so much hate,1,NOT
trish has many many personalities and maybe one of her personalities actually is a gay dude why cant she vent her feelings like you others want to do..people always want to be gatekeepers on sexual feelings. exhausting. agree or disagree..and move on..live your own sexual life. no one has to accept you or agree with you but we should all tolerate each others choices it has no meaning to my life so why do we care what she feels or wants.,1,NOT
u can be gender fluid and have he/him pronouns but calling yourself trans is offensive,2,NOT
what are you saying about jason lmao,1,NOT
i want to give her advuce that says find a nice sub guy who treats you as good as you need/want him to be the alfa trish you are assertive learn to tell guys what you need/want from them set boundaries up front be matter o fact about what you need from people don't settle look for sub guys they are so sweet and wonderful but you like chaos that is toxic loves you trish.,1,NOT

wait what i thought she identified as a chicken nugget?,2,NOT
i think your just confused trish mental breakdown girrrrl,2,NOT
not to force a label on you but it sounds more like you are identifying with gender non-bianry or gender fluid/neutral you can feel femminie one day and want short boyish hair the next day and that's fine trans isn't quite the definition i would use personally maybe just gender nonconforming you can identify as those and not use they/them use any pronouns you prefer have people call you he/her if you like but trans is a different thing entirely from what you are describing here also saying you are basically a drag queen does not make you trans some drag queens/kings are trans some are not some are straight some are gay some are other things drag queen does not always equal trans.,1,NOT
sis just because you hate your name and you like short hair better doesn't mean you're a boy cut your hair and chill for a minute,2,NOT

having a bad experience being a woman does not mean ur transgender dude being a woman is tuff we get a lot of shit we have to deal w so much that men don't have to so i get wanting to escape being a woman but i think this stems from a place of self hatred and self esteem issues rather than being transgender i think youd feel so sad and lost if you transitioned my cents xoxo,1,NOT

well the only problem is many peoply replace the meat with stuff made of soy all in all good except millions of squaremiles of rainforest gets incinerated to plant soy there and when the soil is deploited they have to incinerate a new piece of forest to get new land for their agriculture and the dead soil they leave behind doesn't get enough time to recover and becomes a degradated forest we can't continue this th rainforest is the biggest carbondioxide storage of our planet and destroying it sets all this carbondioxide free to damage our climate even more if we want to save the planet soy isn't a choice even though of course most of the soy isn't even consumed by the human we still have to care about where the stuff we consume comes from,1,NOT
of course the meat eaters react negatively eating meat makes them more confrontational using the reptilian brain that was not part of our original dna but put there the vegan has overcome that and shut it down we need to be careful to not fuel that divide and conquer mentality we need to stay calm and focused feeding this planet our higher vibrations so in turn we can liberate mother earth.,2,NOT

veganism/plant-based eating is the only thing that makes sense for health and specity humanity all living species) but to use the climate-fanaticism in this is a big mistake as there is not human-caused co2-based climate problem worth talking about we could talk about pollution all the shit that does not include co2 and which seems to have been forgotten completely in the co2-frenzy that is a huge problem!! co is a greenhouse gas in the sense that it makes everything grow faster ask anybody with a professional greenhouse operation and hence greening the planet but since it is heavier than air and always will fall down ever heard about gravity? and cannot hold heat it does not cause any traditional greenhouse effect.. when the grand solar minimum is cooling the planet dangerously and the whole global warming thing is debunked finally it may take the whole vegan movement with it which would be a disaster for the reasons mentioned above.....,2,NOT

i'm a long-time advocate of whole plant-based diet and i'm very supportive of anything that gets large portions of the population to make the switch away from animal products however the attitude toward food and diet and what we associate it with needs to change as well food and diet should be viewed primarily as a component of health and hygiene instead we are all too often associating food with pleasure celebration and entertainment....which also includes all vices such as alcohol tobacco illegal drugs gambling pornography casual sexual encounters and many other hedonistic obsessions that are all harmful to health in the long-run people eating some of these new plant-based substitutes for burgers sausages and other animal foods are holding on to their traditional sources of pleasure i also agree that we need to eliminate animal farming for various reasons including environmental protection but again it is folly to believe this will solve the problems we face with pollution and climate warming the only solution that will ever have a chance of saving us from ourselves if it isn't already too late is to dramatically downsize human impact on the planet and that can only happen by an equally dramatic downsizing of the global population unless that happens and happens consistently and fairly quickly we are toast....all the other efforts to reverse climate change will not be sufficient not even close.,1,NOT

not a bad documentary and i'm really happy that it doesn't only highlights the positive side but also talks about possible arguments against veganism and disproves them afterwards but i've got the feeling that it's mostly focussing on the economical part although i think it would be much more beneficial to shed light on the concrete impacts on our environment i see the focus here mostly on famous representatives of the vegan communities and less on the actual reasons why people should go vegan nevertheless i think it is awesome that youtube has now free documentaries as well and that even the ones without netflix can inform themselves about the plant-based diet.,1,NOT

vox is propaganda pay gap is myth companies would only hire women if this was true!,2,NOT
wait doesn't vox spout bullshit but.. this is all true,2,NOT
i thought jfk passed an equal pay bill,1,NOT
inequality for rich people so sad doesn't it just break your heart?,2,NOT
one of the jobs was lion tamer.,1,NOT
"within a healthy balanced diet a man needs around 0,500kj 2,500kcal a day to maintain his weight for a woman that figure is around ,400kj 2,000kcal a day so a man earns more money since he has to eat more than a woman makes sense to me.",3,NOT
wow it took you years to acknowledge that the pay gap is a myth and that perpetuating lies may hurt your image your arrogance knows no bounds by the way you're not fooling anyone anyone with even half a brain knows you'll lie about anything for as long as you can get away with it.,3,NOT
i'm not sure why everyone is complaining about their wages like i'm triggered because an apache attack tomatoe to-mah-toe like me gets nothing -  we need money to ,1,NOT
even 2 isn't good enough it's gotta be 00%,1,NOT
"the wage gap is false men are more likely to go to work sick while women are more likely to call in sick and lot's of time call in sick a couple days a month because it's that time again"" and men are more likely to work overtime this is statistics not sexisim",2,NOT
you make it sound like all women resent being mothers and its a chore to be a mom...,1,NOT

"also you have to look at the total reality who has to buy the house car who pays for the dates and vacations who pays for all the bullshit the woman and the kids want who pays for child support and alimony while the female just gets on welfare and gets free handouts that will further justify the wages gap"".",2,NOT
wow i'm surprised vox made a video on this very impressed.,1,NOT
"1:0 men earn 400,00 but women earn 0 less at 250,000%.. that's 2.5 as much not 0 less which would be 160,000)",1,NOT
i liked most of this video it does acknowledge women make more housework and less hours but you've presented this as something that needs to be shrinked that's honestly not true.,2,NOT
theres already laws that make paying women less illegal and you can sue companies for doing so so why arent you taking them to court? and why do you think another piece of paper reiterating a law already in place is going to do anything dumbass,3,NOT
people have such weird ideologies,2,NOT
thanks for telling me what to think vox!,1,NOT
so basically it's more of the various inconveniences that come with strict work hours than it is about sexism like the media makes it out to be this is extremely interesting,2,NOT
i honestly believe that a job that requires extreme physical labor should amount to the same pay as a job that requires extreme mental labor both forms of jobs are used to service the world and if one were to not exist we wouldn't have a sustainable world i believe that gaps exist in both experience and that experience compared to mental vs physical i really don't think that a construction worker gets as much as a surgeon however both jobs are important one can save a life or give new life and the other can build homes for that life to live in.,2,NOT
so the gender wage gap has nothing to do with discrimination and everything to do with personal choices it cracked me up that at the end she suggested we need to change jobs that reward working long hours because women don't tend to choose to work long hours what we really need to do is accept that it's ok for men to earn more as long as it's simply a result of their decision to be more dedicated to their work.,2,NOT
did vox just disprove the gender wage gap vox?,1,NOT
more flexible hours two birds with one stone i like it!,1,NOT
if the argument is that women spend more time taking care of children the solution would not be to make flexible hours for them its to let men take paternal leave if you give them flexible hours it only incentivizes businesses to pay them less.,1,NOT
$1 says that my old highschool is just conveniently ignoring this video we at one point spent and entire hour talking about how men are payed more than woman and completely ignored the fact that it is illegal to pay someone more or less based on sex race etc if i could go back with the knowledge i have now i could easily disprove them but sadly at the time i still thought the crazy ones were just feminazi's and not the whole feminism movement as a whole.,3,NOT
wait people still believe in the wage gap myth this has been debunked more times than i can remember and anyone who spends more than seconds thinking about it will realize why on average men work more hours and work in the higher paying and more dangerous fields. omg sexism men make up 0 of workplace deaths omg omg omg.omg sexism!!!!! if men complained as much as feminists.,2,NOT
didnt expect this from vox,1,NOT
on the people who say it dosent exist you are sorta right if you factor out childbearing it disappears the wage gap is evidence of gender roles that negatively impact people,1,NOT
if women want to make as much as men go get a job on an oil rig get a job working on an electoral lines get a job in a coal mine become an iron worker become an electrician become a wielder become an petroleum engineering get into building trade and construction careers become an mechanical engineers become a rocket scientists become a machinist become a brick layer become a roofer study in a stem field etc etc etc this does not happen very often because women make different choices the main reason they become the most important job ever a mom.,2,NOT
wage gap is completely bullshit,2,NOT
"copied from chris does vox realise that its main points disproved the theory of the wage gap completely i tried to sit here for half an hour to collect counter arguments to all your points considering that people in the comments are arguing that people didn't watch the video i managed to cut it down to a few points  your statistics in a few areas only correlated to certain fields of work e.g business) this creates a misleading argument in the statement you made you also did not reveal the ratio of men women in the graduate pool so its very difficult to accurately say that men had higher salaries out the gate"" do you mean on average or in the whole what jobs did they take with what companies this doesn't account for peoples choices out of school argument looked at thousands of men and women who graduated from 99 006 men earned more out the gate""  it's a fact that many years ago women were actively payed less than men for the same jobs its completely ridiculous that you are using arguments from 97 all the way back to 948 i mean really? 948? the difference begins shrinking because of pay equality you absolute morons as they approach their 0's and 0's was moving into a time where sexism in the workplace was actively being tackled pay was becoming equal so of course the gap closed it really has nothing to do with pregnancy at this point argument :25 if you look at women born 973... same thing for women 968.. 948....  if you do want to argue pregnancy in a relationship it is two peoples choices to have a child having a child has consequences good and bad you have a child you work less to take care of that child perhaps women do take on a disproportionate share of responsibilities but it is up too the people in the relationship to decide who does what we have maternity leave for a reason for both male and females argument :10  these statistics dont take into account the actual jobs themselves its illegal to pay women less these statistics and the way you are phrasing them are misleading stop saying the word pay women aren't payed less they earn less yearly because of their choices in the job argument :45  if you dont show up for work or can't work the same hours as a man you are not going to be payed as much i dont care if your pregnant i dont care if you are lazy you dont show up you dont get payed you are contradicting yourself because it sounds like you are saying women have children which force them to have time off but we should make jobs more flexible for them if you choose a job with less flexible hours thats a choice you made society doesn't have too pander to fit your every need argument some jobs require really specific hours not available to her clients when they need her"" :30 i could go on but this is boring now your still citing statistics from the 970s to fit whatever agenda you are pushing in 017 so congratz if you wanted too prove that the wage gap only happens now because women work less hours you did it women aren't paid less than men so too call it a wage gap is totally misleading women get the same salary as man women earn less than men yearly on the whole because of their choices jobs hours etc this entire video was confusing and misleading it sounded like you were saying women are payed less then you were saying they weren't but all i took out of it was that in order to shrink the wage gap we need to make jobs more flexable for women"" the simple answer is no btw i cited every source i could in your video every point i made has your quotes and even the video times you quoted a lot of studies is it that hard too add them too the description?",2,NOT
there are a few things not included vacation time amount of total hours worked hard labor and also how taking leave affects ones future pay by the way most of what affects pay in higher end jobs is pay negotiated by employee and employers.,2,NOT
so if women would choose to work crappy hours like men choose to work crappy hours they'll make almost the same holy cow what a concept!,2,NOT
omg we've entered retardville.,3,NOT
"its not a question about it shrinking or what it is it's still a gap and still is something we have to fix,",1,NOT
in this comment section you'll find teenage boys who didn't watch the whole video and blindly associate wage gap with tumblr feminism _-,1,NOT
why are there so many dislikes lol,1,NOT
back when vox made good videos.,1,NOT
women make less because they decide to make less more then men.,3,NOT
vox great video!,1,NOT
you know what would be nice a video about some form of equality that isn't about the us.,1,NOT
to be honest this was boring asf.,2,NOT
wage gap is proven biased.,2,NOT
"""maybe she's a venture capitalist""... lolololoolol",1,NOT
please provide sources to first prove it exists,1,NOT
wh-what? people who actually understand the wage gap?,1,NOT
i see more triggered men in the comments than feminists lmao.,2,NOT
vox is so stupid that they disprooved the myth gap and they don't accept it,2,NOT
it's not our fault men work more,2,NOT
i think you are all missing the important issue here.. where do i apply for professional stick figure artist??,1,NOT
there is no gender wage gap there is an earnings gap which is to do with hours job type skill level offtime qualifications etc not gender all it shows is that men earn more because they either have a higher paying job have more hours have less offtime have a larger skill set and thus promotion and/or more qualifications.,2,NOT
i should stop hating this i feel like i am hating dumb woman because i am being rejected by girls that i hit on and should just go for the ugly ones instead of hot girls.,2,NOT
her voice is hard to listen to for very long.,2,NOT
so more women should enter science and tech cool why aren't they and why do they expect the business fields to change working hours for women's needs instead of planning ahead for children and choosing your field accordingly?,2,NOT
it isn't just the hours women retire earlier which is the time in your career you typically make the most money men typically are more willing to take dangerous jobs over safe ones which is why we see more men as ice road truckers and more women as nannies men typically are willing to take more risks move accross country for a better job pish harder to negotiate their salaries etc there is so much that goes into this looking at this statistic is just plain misleading.,2,NOT
in the top paying degrees of them are men dominated in the top least paying degrees of them are women dominated.,1,NOT
we had feminism to give women choice we have feminism again because most women didn't choose to go into stem jobs?,2,NOT
has no one thought that the wage gap could be because women don't try as hard at their respective jobs as men do,3,NOT
i think this really doesn't express the problem,1,NOT
get rid of the fair pay act.,2,NOT
so the earnings gap is due to women's choices is what you're saying women more often choose not to go for jobs if they have to work less flexible hours whereas men more often choose to go for those jobs fair and square no problem there.,2,NOT
i know what we miss is that it's not real their just saved everyone's time,2,NOT
the only way the wage gap is going to be fixed is if men stop being stereotyped to be the provider and start being shown as a care giver like being nurses or teachers more often oh and of course take care of their d*am children!!,2,NOT
i work with a pretty heavy amount of women and they all make as much if not more than i do they also tend to do things like smoke breaks more often constantly using their phones constantly needing to leave mid-work to go deal with their children.,2,NOT
wait this was actually logical,1,NOT
very hard for men to give birth until that changes this non issue will always be like this.,2,NOT
women making that kind of money is disgusting that's way too much for them to be earning,5,ABU
wow vox made a video i actually think is well put together and i agree with!,1,NOT
the wage gap is a difference in hours worked on same jobs if a man works jours while a women works the standard then the man is paid more,2,NOT
tired of this bullshit am unsubscribing,2,NOT
youtube is suggesting that the next video i watch is called there is no gender wage gap from prageru which implies that this is the type of video watched by many who watched this one that's interesting because this video provides a nuanced understanding of the gap based on research while i'm fairly certain prageru based on many of their other vidoes does not of course if there was no gap there would be at least some industries in which men are underpaid which do not currently exist hats off to vox for making the argument of those crazies in a non-crazy rational manner.,2,NOT
aid agent too advanced.,1,NOT
it's unconstitutional to require businesses to hire certain people and to pay them a mandated amount!,2,NOT
wow this was done by vox?? i can't believe they didnt ride the same there is a wage gap. its because of oppression line that has been projected for decades.,1,NOT
equal pay act of 963 people want something to complain about so they dismiss variables and this is where this wage gap came from if you are a woman getting paid less than a man for the same work in the same job take it to court instead of complaining online,2,NOT
quite sure women of my generation outearn men of my generation . the 00 graduation rate probably explains it.,1,NOT
good thing you had a female presenter otherwise it would've been mansplaining'.,2,NOT
so what you're saying is that women earn less because they have children which then restricts the hours they can work and reduces their relative levels of experience when compared with people who have worked full time for the most part the other gaps are likely due to the fact that men and women are different with men having more physical strength more body mass higher muscle body composition ratio being taller more likely to take risks slightly higher iq's family roles encouraging males to work harder to support the family while the woman is caring for the baby ect.. until you invent a way for children to be made without the need for a mother and for as long as you're not pumping little girls with relatively huge amounts of testosterone hgh and retraining them to not be risk adverse or perhaps giving little boys drugs to make them more compliant and drugs to stunt their growth reduce their testosterone drastically there will always be a wage gap.,3,NOT
if women that are not care givers and single without kids are making less than a man then we have a problem i don't see why its such a big deal that a women or a man can choose to be the one that stays and takes care of kids during early child development kids are important and there should not be shame to those that choose to take care of the children women or men.,1,NOT
to fix this gap you don't make jobs more flexible time-wise that's just stupid what you do is make sure that domestic duties especially involving children are split equally between husband and wife this way women can have kids and still have a career in a job that demands a lot of time also women are treated unfairly in the workplace they're seen as less effective and evaluated under harder criteria than a man is in order to get promoted to fix this gap we need to make sure women are respected and seen just as capable as a man is and also make sure that domestic work is something everyone should do and is not considered unmanly‚Äù because a lot of these things are not outright discrimination and mostly on the subconscious level we do not realize it is a problem but it is and it has shown the consequences.,1,NOT
the wage gap is what we call a myth,2,NOT
i was worried that there would be an obvious political slant but i'm happy to say this is quite fair in it's analysis of one part of the pay gap.,1,NOT
lmao it's funny how 5 0 people still think they should get paid more for no reason.,2,NOT
i am outraged! according to the numbers women garbage truck drivers make zero dollars!! wtf!?!? oh wait that's cuz there are zero women garbage truck drivers sorry my bad.,2,NOT
there is no wage gap women statistically work less than men to care for children or take more vacations because woman also will take more time off than a man will,2,NOT
i'd rather like to see bell curves of income-distribution rather than merely talking about averages the issue eludes me at large the grand overall gap between the genders is irrelevant as except for this video the grand biological impact of children is almost always glossed over and the mother who doesn't want to focus on her little bundle of cries and diapers is nothing but a bad parent those times are what social security systems/policies are for the only real relevant part is are you getting the same per hour for the same quality of work and the opposite is illegal in most civilised countries anyway if your quality lacks and therefore you get less than your peers and that's not enough for you look for a job that better suits your skillset a world where everyone is required to work shouldn't exist that is just a tyrannical exploitative hell i'm completely fine when one partner whoever it is is able to sustain their family alone freeing the other to focus on the family.,2,NOT
i disregard the whole video when your first statement is an obvious lie,2,NOT
if the gender wage gap had any reasonable meaning companies would increasingly and almost only hire women to lower their wage costs nobody does that therefore closing the gender wage gap is a target entirely based on ideology in particular the premise that men and women are equal in the sense that they should achieve the same income on average this is equal in saying that a construction worker should earn on avg the same income as a stock analyst because they are both humans and therefore equally capable of earning the same the gender wage gap was and still is ideological bullshit.,2,NOT
i does not exist,2,NOT
fake women get treated the same,2,NOT
stop having kids with shitty men then they can share the bearing of the kids equally and neither have to sacrifice their jobs!,2,NOT
you live in a free country woman are allowed to earn less if they want they are allowed to earn more if they want if they want to be a ceo and have kids unless the man takes care of them it won't work u can't have it all and that's okay,2,NOT
for thous who say there is no wage gap watch the video before making a comment please.,1,NOT
good video but you're using wage gap and earnings gap interchangeably when the reality is different.,1,NOT
