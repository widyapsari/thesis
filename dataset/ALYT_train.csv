equal choices not equal opportunities,NOT
finally im not the only one who thinks the same,NOT
they also don't count industries where women make more per hour than men.,NOT
woman loses and starts a petition fucking sore loser ahahaha,ABU
there's no problem here the women only earn less on average because of decisions they make for themselves to say that there is a problem is more sexist than claiming there's a wage gap because you're saying women should be working the higher paying jobs like the men instead of doing what they want,NOT
this is unfair i do the shot put in track and field and i can't imagine competing against a transgender women with the build and strengths of a man i have no problem against transgenders but there's a line for sports females cannot physical compete for strength or muscle build with male build it's why the sport is split by gender.,ABU
i see two solutions to this problem wage increases for lower-income jobs encourage women to take up ceo and political positions and ask for raises more it's well-known that women are not as interested on average in ceo and political positions as men that is why it's fair that women make up 5 of politicians because about 5 of the people running for office are women if this has to do with their upbringing then this can be fixed but if this is just because women on average don't want those jobs then the only solution is to raise the wages on lower-income jobs also i find it ironic that women in the us are the majority of people going to and graduating from college yet they're still under represented in higher income positions.,NOT
i am going to trigger everyone i meet at school with this info.,NOT
joaquin phoenix is such a vegan king i love him so much,NOT
lol i love that there are more dislikes than likes.,NOT
unfair period it's ok to identify as a women but at the end of the day they are physically boys i would not allow my daughter to compete with them period not because they are transgender simply because like you heard on the video doctors do not even know exactly how the hormones are affecting their bodies its sad that those girls who trained hard and work hard to get to that point and they were cheated period we just live in world that allows people to make whatever decisions they want and they want to be treat the same as everyone else but in this cases they are not like most regular girl they have an unfair advantage i bet if it was a more physical sport that like wrestling or soccer everyone would feel differently cause people would be able to see the obvious difference and advantage and strength and some case size i mean i get it we want them to feel normal but did anyone think the girls are being robbed of a experience as well.,NOT
absolutely unfair but who cares about the biological girls that train hard for this but can't outrun biology.,ABU
good work all of your and thank you for all you do,NOT
what is her email i need to reach out to her i need help going vegan,NOT
i love how shes talking about being transgender and eating chick-fil-a at the same time.,NOT
"""do i think i'm a transgender yes a thousand  do i identify with my natural born gender a thousand  that's kinda the thing with being transgender..you don't identify with your biological gender this is the whole point you don't like your breasts you don't like your curves and the term they/them has nothing to do with being transgender most people who use the pronouns they/them do not identify with either the female pronouns she/her nor the male pronouns he/him"" i'm not saying that transgender people can not identify with they/them i'm saying that it doesn't have anything to do with transgender.",NOT
didn't you say you thought you were black too what's next you gonna think you are a horse trapped in a trans man gay black female ,ABU
that chair looks extremely uncomfortable,NOT
'chef is definitely not a job with flexible hours.. that being said i really enjoyed this video thanks vox!,NOT
the left treat facts like kryptonite this is a great video i can't help but feel sorrow in the fact that because this video is so strong in facts it makes it stronger to be rejected because leftists treat facts and truth like repellant.,NOT

yay i'm so happy for you trish pasta is the best just eat a lot of it and eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and it'll keep you full for a while,NOT
check out hot for food on you tube all vegan all amazing ,NOT
i think some of the gap can be down to how well men women negotiate i have a totally awesome strong female friend who recently negotiated salary for a new position and she just couldn't push hard on the salary the employer played it down in the range and my friend took the middle ground her skills are awesome and she's an absolute dream asset in her field but she just wouldn't push for the top end money i think guys are more likely to do that.,NOT
the weird thing is if you really got to pay women less than men even if they had the same amount of experience work productivity etc. there would be companies willing to hire way more women than men cheaper labor.. also you never hear the companies that are supposedly paying women so much less than men why because it doesn't really exist again men generally choose fields that pay more than fields that are dominated by women men and women simply make different career choices because shockingly men and women are different.,NOT
try your coffee with soy milk or almond milk its amazing,NOT
i keep trying to like this video more than once and it won't let me.,NOT
oh ok... who wants burger king i'll pay.,NOT
and download pinterest and search up vegan recipes :,NOT
facts thank you for this feminism needs to be removed from humanity,ABU
why do you even care?,NOT
i don't understand why the fuck those men who work in the slaughter houses have to be so cruel do they seriously only hire degenerates who have gotten out of prison to do that job? what is up with the excess violence? those men are not men they are little fucked up boys who never grew up with serious complex issues and probably tiny dicks.,ABU
if you're going to include unpaid working hours then why not include as pay the cost of chocolate and flowers that woman get on valentines day and her birthday the cost of the vacation trips her man takes her on the cost of the movie tickets and popcorn her share of the restaurant bill and entertainment her share of rent or the mortgage utilities the engagement ring the wedding that some man paid for and her share of the income tax that he ends up paying and the child support that she uses to buy new dress and shoes the health and life insurance that he pays and how about the social security and life insurance payments she will receive and everything she will inherit just because she married a man now you know why men don't live as long as women.,ABU
trisha i am literally sooooo proud of you holly crap❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤ and if you watch freelees what i eat in a day she is a super huge help when i went vegan i would just look up vegan recipe videos they help too,NOT
for once i'm actually happy i got an ad on yt i really hope this vid spreads more so more people will know,NOT
to be honest videos like this is are why no one takes the lgbtq community seriously how can we expect people to not make fun of us when theirs people like trisha who use serious topics such as being transgender as a way to get more views and publicity this honestly disgusts me im sorry,NOT
we need to push bigger on vegan propaganda. so only then we will be able to change hundreds of thousands years of meat eating habits to veganism,NOT
this doesn't add up.. wheres the dysphoria... does she not realise how its works in general like the transition part,NOT
but then these idiots come back with well the patriarchy keeps women from choosing what they want! ‍♂️,ABU
if ppl could get away with paying women less then they would just hire women.,NOT
women work in different fields different fields pay different salary women have maternity leave so they take a cut on pay for it there is no wage gap if the gap existed every company would only hire women since it would be cheaper.,NOT
yess vegans take over!🌱,NOT
many women can't start a carrer im higher paid occupations.,NOT
now you may wonder why jobs that are historicaly woman jobs have lower pay,NOT
she is confused about everything that's all,NOT
it's a guy so race the guys,ABU
the future is vegan ,NOT
it's plainly illegal in the modern world uk and us for example to pay a woman less for the same amount of work if it's happening she needs to sue otherwise nothing can be done now that feminists have invested billions and a holiday in this total non issue will they consider discussing how men are 1 of workplace deaths and suicides oh yeah that's right they're feminists and they do not care about men at all even to the point of manufacturing issues for attention right now women in the west can either work like any man or become a housewife and have her husband pay for everything then possibly divorce and get half his cash meanwhile men in the west like all of history must work or else they are less then trash feminists have no plan on correcting this huge imbalance and in fact will work to keep it in place.,NOT
i decided to try pescatarian because of a hot youtube girl talking about it and i mainly eat rice with fish for lunch it wasn't too hard to cut red meat after doing more research i realize maybe i should go vegan i need to get better at cooking and preparing meals and recipes to make the transition easier i'm trying to clean out my fridge of old stuff and then replacing it with whole plant based food it's healthier cheaper and better for animals environment humans etc never in a million years would i have considered going vegan beforehand thanks malin malle.,NOT
are you ever going to address what you did to vegancheetah's channel,NOT
this better be how it doesn't exist.,NOT
feminists so often portray the wage gap as being about discrimination in the business sector probably because the gap is highest there the problem i have is how they insist on applying this to all men and all women those guys collecting garbage probably don't have it better than women working part time in a law firm but we kind of pretend they do everything has to be because of the patriarchy after all it's all men oppressing all women rather than just people who have more opportunities being more likely to get high paying jobs.,NOT
thank you freelee 💜💜,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap there is none.,NOT
who are you,NOT
women in aggregate and men in aggregate have different work profiles so why would you expect them to have identical pay outcomes?,NOT
i'm on month  i'll subscribe to you for two weeks if you stay vegan i'll stay subscribed deal good luck girl -,NOT
child-rearing who'd have thunk it seriously you need a study for this more seriously this seems to be just another instantiation of how men an women are and behave differently meaning if we collect all factors contributing to the so called wage gap' we likely find out the playing field was level all along the players just moved differently on it.,NOT
feminists keep it chill,NOT
this is so awesome!! stick to the basics and you'll be fine smoothies fresh fruit potatoes rice.. and chipotle burrito bowls are a good fast food option too 🏼,NOT
+vox can you please say what your units are on literally any of your graphs apparently women earn 0. less than men when they are around 5 $0.5 or what your graphs are literally meaningless without units.,NOT

this is the stupid sjw world we live in men and women are  not  the  same if you were born x guess what you are x this like and ant deciding one day to join an elephant herd because he thinks he's an elephant now i'm cool with lgbt but this is freaking beyond ridiculous you aren't a boy or a girl you are your own thing so unless there is a transgender track and field you need to sit your big muscular dress wearing ass down somewhere what more proof do you need that the laws around gender is fucking backwards and overkill,ABU
lissa's raw food romance is one of my favorite vegan channels you should check it out!,NOT
i don't think trisha is ok,NOT
i fix garbage trucks for  hours a week on average most people only work  hours now find how many will climb in the back of a garbage truck in ankle deep garbage juice broken glass and hydraulic oil to spend hours replacing a cylinder while maggots are crawling around you compare that to answering a phone,NOT
then people are nothing but a bunch of weirdos and i wouldn't trust them around my kids.,NOT
i'm actually surprised about how well made the video is my only question is why is this a problem the results are clearly because of life choices which women make so why do we need to close the wage gap at all?,NOT
woman are just incompetent in math/science which are higher order skill set obviously men should be paid more and there should be a gap given man are more competent,ABU
tbh how do you keep your kitchen so pretty lol,NOT
as the video demonstrated the wage gap does exist and is driven by the society valuing male dominated professions more as a business owner i do find that women often times agree to the lower salary compared to men.,NOT
first off all when you see people being vegan raw raw to four vegetarian and fruitarian and their not over weight fat chubby or obese of course they will look good because they where original skinny and didn't have to lose so much weight they will look good and will promote that their lives are the best way to live where bigger people if they do theses diets or go on theses lives styles they will end up with excess skin just like every other diet.,NOT
not wanting ur period not liking the societal pressures sexualization abuse u get from being female and wanting to fuck people does not mean ur trans a trans male,NOT
that sure did last long! i'm sure the chicken and waffles she snapped were gr though.,NOT
trisa seems to have the same mentality i did in middle school when i was just leaning about this stuff and trying to figure myself out and my sister was trying to push me to be trans news flash im not.,NOT
what's sad is it doesn't matter how many times we explain this the idiots who believe women are paid less will ignore the facts,NOT
they suck at being men so they think they can excel at beating women they should tighten their jocks straps and go play with the boys.,ABU
number of female ceo's too damn low number of female coal miners just fine.,NOT
i'm with you on trisha not being trans and everything you said related to trans specifically but i don't understand the need to invalidate non-binary people.,NOT
i´d like to take this one step further and question why female dominated college majors don´t pay off i mean we´re talking early childhood education psychology community organization and social work these things are unarguably important and no less essential to a functioning society than petroleum engineering so why does so little money flow there making the jobs even more unattractive than they already are the way different working fields are rewarded directly reflects on what values a society holds and while economic interests may be a justification it´s surely not an ethical one sorry for any grammar errors not a native speaker),NOT
i hate the sound of vocal fry it ruins important informative videos like this.,NOT
girl you're a tomboy not a dude or transgender. i don't have many female friends either and i get along with males more because many women are two faced bitches!,ABU

equal pay act of 96 196 i can never remember which one it is) most of it comes from overtime and the fact that men ask for raises more often alongside the actual jobs.,NOT
this was filmed a month ago trish has not had pink nails since filming her music video for daddy issues she's gone through red and baby blue and just got them done today bullshit.,NOT
she's not trans but that would only mean she has another mental illness i genuinely think she's confused and tries to find her identity she doesn't have the vocabulary to express herself and that's why she's contradicting herself you can't cancel a human being.. she feels fluid and that's why she needs a therapist she doesn't have to apologise for her confusion just like we shouldn't believe her and we shouldn't think she lies because we don't know imagine if she's right then all of the hate right now is suicide fuel for her.,ABU
there are so many factors that are not included for example how many woman were followed and how many man more woman means more chance a woman will land a high paying job that raises the average.,NOT

i was surprised to see a similar discussion with this video happening in japan.it seems that there are people who like propaganda not a sober discussion in any country a politician who tried to make a cool argument would be crushed by the media it would happen in any country.,NOT
i am so excited that trisha is doing this love her i hope it suits her really well and that she is happy being vegan!,NOT
i understand why men hate the feminist movement men are not personally responsible for the devaluation of women's work to tackle this problem from the perspective of feminism is a mistake because it points the finger at men rather the finger should be pointed to capitalism businesses pay women less now and historically because they can and could so yes i believe in equal work for equal pay yet the lower paying jobs seem to be women's work. is it then actually a choice or enslavement?,NOT
i am so happy for trisha amazing trisha your a hero🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍊🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇,NOT

businesses don't hire only women simce they bitch and moan because of periods and need to take months off for giving birth cuz they're all whores,ABU
it also doesn't take into account the stem jobs like construction and things of the hard labor that men usually do now it has nothing to do with the thought that one sex is stronger than the other but more to the fact that women don't usually take those jobs also the fact that scientifically men are usually more competitive and will take longer hours.,NOT

equal pay act 970 an act to prevent discrimination as regards terms and conditions of employment between men and women the equal pay act 97 is an act of the united kingdom parliament which prohibits any less favourable treatment between men and women in terms of pay and conditions of employment.,NOT

how incompented can you be,NOT
when i went vegan i went into it fully unprepared d i don't know how i survived and that was years ago when vegan food wasn't as available as it is today i'm from europe i'd suggest you to buy a lot of staples don't try to go 00 pure/clean and healthy because you will feel like a failure if you slip up i know i do so i buy myself a lot of healthy staples unprocessed food. but now and then i buy some prepared vegan spreads bread veggie burgers etc so pasta in all forms whole wheat white from different cereals beans lentils canned) mixed frozen veggies buckwheat mushrooms and a looot of fruit dry fruit is good too when you have cravings for something dates popcorn if you have a machine you can air pop it) potatoes sweet potatoes brown rice basmati rice white rice black rice wild rice red rice oats some type of plant milk try them out) mixed nuts seeds to sprinkle on your salad soo lettuce of some kind it's nice to eat salad once in a while) while i don't suggest eating oil. it's good to have it in the beginning cold pressed coconut oil is perfection when combining with tomato sauce d virgin olive oil isn't bas as well but i wouldn't recommend heating it if you have a farmer's market buy fruit in bulk because if you don't have ripe fruit around you won't desire eating it whenever you feel like eating something just google vegan _____ and i think there exist a vegan version of anything oh and the best and healthiest icecream out there is banana ice cream or nicecream  the best thing ever that is a must if you feel lost then try a vegan online challenge you have a lot of pages that you can sign up to and they send you tips on how to start where to start what to eat where to buy etc good luck,NOT

did vox read the study they posted in their description the study states that 4 of the wage gap of mba's is a result of differences in mba courses taken and gpa differences in career interpretations and weekly hours worked that reduces the wage game to 5% a direct quote from the study fifteen years after obtaining their ba women who earned an mba had the lowest labor force participate rate the lowest share working full time and full year and took the greatest amount of non-educational time off from employment compared with others having professional degrees and phd's vox if you want to discuss the wage gap and present your view on it then at least reference a source that supports your view and not one that opposes it.,NOT

insecticides mostly petroleum based that are sprayed on the plants contaminates the bees who pollinate everything and the run off contaminates the streams i live behind a 0 acre soy bean field and the ammonia fertilizer that is sprayed sometimes is so strong i cant breath i have raised bees that die because of mass spraying of insecticides so don't act like you are saving the world by eating your veggies you want to save the world grow your own veggies and good luck trying to raise a productive garden without using pesticides i have raised many gardens and it ain't easy i have chickens and they will lay a egg a day without a rooster if they aren't eaten they will just rot a rooster has to be present before they can get fertilized to hatch life so i have no problem with vegetarians but because a egg is in cornbread or cake and you can't eat it because you are vegan thats just a little out there for me but i still respect you i also have a few well cared for cows and goats who clean up the land so i don't have to mow ,NOT
i'm so happy for you! i am a vegan also and i just wanna give you some tips so you don't make the same mistakes i did i went vegan after watching freelee and at first i lost a ton of weight cause i still ate a normal ratio of macronutrients carbs protein fat and ate a reasonable amount for my body weight once i started taking freelees advise i developed binge eating disorder no of course that is not completly freelees fault but her emphasis on smashing in the carbs led me to trying to eat as much as her then i eventually got used to it i ended up gaining even more than i lost originally my triglycerides in my blood test were too high and i was struggling with digestive issues and energy level issues i am still struggling with binge eating to this day two years later but try as hard as i can to actually eat only when i'm hungry not out of boredom and stop when i feel good and satisfied rather than overstuffed and feeling like i'm gonna explode.,NOT
blaire you look amazin!,NOT
freelee i have a question how does it feel to be the coolest vegan ever?,NOT
im a normal heterosexual male 32) didnt hear about this gender pay gap until couple years ago at first i thought very briefly why men earned more...if anything i thought women would have earned more by giving men sexual favours to get to the top...(honestly this was what i could come up with lol) and i couldnt understand why a male heterosexual would even have a desire to pay women less...absolutely nothing apparent to me but then i heard the various reasons why...from ppl like jordan peterson..and now i know the reasons for the gap it is nothing about men deliberately or desiring to pay women less just cause they are women..its a byproduct of the choices and other stuff like how its measured etc...,NOT
watch the vegan activist cheap lazy vegan mr and mrs vegan and that vegan couple,NOT
40%of 00k is 50k interesting maths,NOT
like i've always said wage gap is a joke i've said this exact thing years ago and was laughed at plus in most hourly wage jobs that require physical labor men are usually grossly underpaid while women are overpaid if you've ever worked in a warehouse type job that requires lifting you know i'm telling the truth the fact is men need fewer days off and we are genetically built to work women are built to reproduce thats not sexism it's fact i respect women and if they can do the job they deserve to be paid for it more often than not they are men usually can work more hours and take fewer days off.. thats the gap not sexism.,NOT

so why are traditionally female-dominated occupations lower paying than traditionally male-dominated ones ie why do trades people engineers and lawyers making more than teachers social workers and nurses is it because men once ruled almost the entire workforce and put more value on their own strengths and less on female-oriented ones such as caring for others this systematic inequality has been perpetuated over the years it's not just about the choices females make it's about what we value in our workforce that has been dictated to us decades ago by men.,NOT
glad to see that there are still some sane democrats in the world such as christina.,NOT
i'm so excited to hear that your trying veganism hopfully u stay vegan more than weeks love ya,NOT
thank u i requested this!!,NOT
it's not a wage gap it's an earnings gap,NOT
there are only two genders and there is no gender wage gap that's the true.,NOT
the only possible way to kill all wage inequality is by helping to make sharing wages a normal thing,NOT
problem with transgender and sexuality acceptance is people label themselves too quickly i've been out as bisexual to most since i was  when it wasn't a popular thing as i'm only 6 i thought it overtime and felt completely ready people assume just because sometimes being a women sucks it means you're a guy nah bro nah.,NOT
i became vegan towards new years last year and had no idea this was the year of vegan but way to end this decade with a new way of living,NOT
think this vid misses a huge aspect of the gender pay gap little girls are taught to dress in pink and love unicorns and princesses....then they grow up and are expected to have babies stem subjects aren't sexy no wonder they don't choose them the issue with the pay gap is not just a of money difference it's a cultural difference and stems from how we raise our girls versus boys.,NOT
no wonder u can't have kids,NOT
"i was in costco taking a picture of beyond meats pizza a woman wanted to know why i was i told her i wanted to post it on my facebook page.i told her beyond meat was not targeting vegans,but they are trying to reach flexitarians she had not heard of flexitarians but felt this is an approach she wants to try to follow.",NOT
nah...them some dudes with wigs ,ABU
she's not staying vegan,NOT
feminists and the left like to indulge on the past so much why have they not discovered the equal pay act of 963?,NOT
noone privileged cis white women hm i am going to pretend to be trans,NOT
"well the calculations are indeed wrong but there is a wage gap.. this video just takes a wrong calculation and uses it to say yeah.. everything is fake"" but the real wage gap not that one which is commonly used by a lot of public media and politicians is determined by looking at men and women who acutally do the same thing in the same company at the same office and even if most of you don't want to accept it there is a difference it is absolutly true if a men and a women go to a job interview for exactly the same position and talking to exactly the same boss there is a high chance that they get different wage offers this ist statistically proven.",NOT
watch that vegan couple's video on you i really think that it'd be helpful i'm so happy that you're finally going vegan and i hope that you do it right so that you can stay on this lifestyle love you ️,NOT
ok girl you gotta buy more of those fruits buy those fruits in bulk more food it's sounds weird but you gotta eat more if your gonna keep the lifestyle going ❤️🌱,NOT
been waiting for this video since the second trisha offended the whole world! 🏼👏🏼👏🏼,NOT
you took a survey of men and women who graduated.. okay did every single man and woman go into the exact and job no they problem with this gap does not bring into the choice that women choose versus men,NOT
we love that women finally got equality in sports and now two men want to compete against us to beat us in our own category...,ABU
this is so great  raw till is great for weight loss.. i've also heard a lottttt of people lose weight on the starch solution as well you should do some research on that either way you're going to look and feel amazing.,NOT
this brings about a point that women feel pressured to not presue further education and education in the higher paying jobs does this raise a point that there is a problem with how we raise children and what paths they are guided down,NOT
i don't have a problem with them being transgender although i do think people should be who they are born to be i have a problem with them taking victory's in sports in which physical men excel in while the true woman champion gets rd instead of st it's freken logic for goodness sakes.,NOT
first of all if you know trisha you know that she is definitely just shitposting and unfortunately for her it's completely blown up and gone too far and now she's cant turn back without being completely cancelled second of all i find it shocking the way the lgbtq community prestigious members of the community have reacted to the news the way most people have reacted to her completely contradicts to what they normally preach about transgender people they will allow predators to convince themselves and others that they can get periods and pms even though they have male genitalia but when a known troll comes out suddenly they're offended i know trisha just as well as the next person but what if she actually does have gender dysphoria and this is how the hypocrites that are social justice warriors react if anything she's exposing the hypocrisy within the lgbtq online community.,NOT
she is literally insane i don't even think she is educated does she know what dysphoria is?,ABU
this is the best moment of my life so proud of you good job freelee!,NOT
if only the facts mentioned in this video applied for my country _-,NOT
it is cheating they are boys.,NOT
you're a dude who in the hell said it's ok to race with girls?,ABU
when comparing a male and female nurse yes the male nurse is paid 8 more this is because the male has more qualifications the reason male nurses gravitate to the best paying nursing specialties work longer hours and find jobs in cities with the highest compensation aka the willing to relocate) career choices and educational differences explain most if not all the gender gap in nursing.,NOT
tbh i still don't understand lol,NOT
children decrease your income and increase your expenses significantly which is why i never understood why some people choose to have them does anyone know the percentage of children who were actually planned for those that were planned what were the reasons such as pressure from parents pressure from spouse etc some people will tell you they don't regret having unplanned kids but they're just making the best of the situation since they could've chosen them later or never at all if having children was so great then sex wouldn't need to be so awesome it's life's biggest scam!,NOT
the amount of dislikes on this video really disappoints me,NOT
right now ive been loving rice!!!!!! so easy so filling so healthy!!,NOT
do vegans hate asians they eat meat therefore theyre evil,ABU
hey ladies i'm hiring garbage collectors full time hours at 20/hr submit your resume to me today!!! insert sound of crickets chirping.... oh okay you're not so unhappy with your job at the mall clothing store making minimum wage that you're ready to step up and earn more money doing harder work got it that's the gender pay gap explained in one sentence women won't do tough jobs and for that reason they don't get paid like men nor should they!),ABU
v o c a l f r y,NOT
until you take away personal choice from women their will be a wage gap force them all into stem and make birth control mandatory,ABU
men are paid more because they normally have to pay taxes and bills for their families but females are not really expected to pay taxes and bills men also are expected to work hard and longer but women are not expected to do so this also depends on how the genders have done based on quality and positive effects on their companies so overall i think men should be paid more.,ABU
why is this even a problem it's all about choice they earn more college degrees than men... so they have more opportunities it's up to them to take it how is this even a feminist issue?,NOT
just because you think you have big dick energy doesn't automatically make you trans basically,NOT
as a former track runner yes they have an advantage a huge advantage!,NOT
if vegans want to save animals why are they eating their food?,NOT
scrolling through the comments looking for freelee,NOT
no issue with transgender but they have to race with the boys not girls alternatively they should start a transgender competition for transgenders.,ABU

thanks klaus nice work:),NOT
>vox not being raging leftists i am doubtful of the underlying motive,NOT
feminism exists because of propaganda like this shite video nice try though i guess the tiny dick white guys need a boost up every now and again and of course all the republican woman who don't have any friends or souls need to feel appeased because their own mothers couldn't stand them and because they can't play well with others,NOT
at first i thought wow trisha passes quite well i can't believe blaire would try to say she's still a guy. and then i realized that i was dead wrong yet again.,NOT
i laughed so hard when u said u r sitting on ur kitchen floor 😂😂😂,NOT

shes probably just trying to wind people up for clout,NOT
she coulda just titled this i am trash..makes more sense to me ..you know it's a con job when she's on the kitchen floor...her logic i cant keep a man so i'll just on the bandwagon and be one...sad...seek help before you damage the entire trans community.,ABU
i love how there weren't any of the more dangerous fields being studied any chance you could look into things like construction or law enforcement plenty of openings we'll always need more masons and police so it's not like there's a limit on jobs there.,NOT
i'm bisexual girl and i've been attracted to straight girls so does that make me a straight man??,NOT

"""this isn't sexism it's just common sense. gold",NOT
work less paid less.,NOT
feminists can never use this card against me😁😁 my own mother makes nearly two times more money than all of her male colleagues because her rank degree scale and years of work experience is much higher.,NOT
the gender pay gap is a myth as proven by the video women desire a more balanved lifestyle more than men men are more likely to work more and harder therefore they get more pay also if your employer is paying you less than a man that's illegal so why don't we see millions of lawsuits every year for discrimination?,NOT
trisha correct me if i'm wrong but i believe you are describing gender fluidity you said that you identify as transgender 000% and you identify with your natural born gender 000%” it is more than okay to feel like you don't fit into just one gender label but just because you relate more to gay men does not mean you are transgender it goes much farther than that please educate yourself about the lgbtq trish,NOT
"i agree with most of the stuff you said in the video but what if there was a huge wage gap on woman on a job?,my good friends mother is working full time as a journalist and is writing news paper for a work time of -1 hours a day i dont remember the paycheck that she needed to make but lets just say by working  hours she is going to make k)she is working like crazy for 0hours and she should make k right well right but the problem is her boss from k she is getting payed a lot less than she should about 200€ she is scared do ask her boss the reason that she gets a low payment because is a little bit hard to find a job in that city i dont know if her boss is sexist or an asshole or even both but that is a huge wage gap and indeed is happening in some reare cases.(i dont disagree with the video i just want to say that this happens some times and i got as a explaination my friends mother that is based on a reall story oh and sorry for my english ",NOT
thank you for spewing the facts and truth and not myths.,NOT
this is really interesting i didnt think about how job flexibility could have a big impact on how much work you can do.,NOT
there absolutely is a wage gap it is illegal to pay men and women differently for the same work under the equal pay act of 963 yet women are not offered the same opportunities as men this video is misleading.,NOT
this gives the information that is needed i am glad that for once vox has given some context to this subject with this proof that they understand the reasons i don't know how you can claim that there is something insidious behind this phenomenon.,NOT
does ur bf count,NOT
soooooo you debunk the wage gap right away then go on to say we need to force equality of median values between full working people regardless of education and job expertiese this is why everyone hates you.,NOT
the real problem with women in the work force is there are stigmas against women doing certain jobs and some male and even female employers would rather hire a man thinking he'd do a better job this happens less and less year after year as less and less we are told to pursue careers that are for girls or for boys so there is an issue but it's not the lack of equal pay for equal work,NOT
who would expect a conservative group to consider every fact right me neither all the arguments that try to explain why there isn't any wage gap miss out one thing of course you know that but you constantly manage to ignore it women have to give birth and therefore  need a stable environment  can't just be available 4/  can't just move around the world as firms want them to i consider a loving father to say the same things but as workers need to get more flexible because the companies are outsourcing their risk to the employees men have to addict to such injustices the real problem is the worker unfriendly workplace,NOT
girl trust me you will never go back,NOT
i really thought she was born male i think there has been lip injections and the hair isn't nice that vocal fry croaky voice is horrible.,NOT
the thing is women and men would earn the same if they are in the same job and have the same credentials the so called wage gape is comparing the average earning of men to women so there really isn't any problem with that.,NOT
noooo freaking way!,NOT
why are you saying that being natural and not putting on makeup or doing your hair is not girly and more of a guy thing?,NOT
the fires are actually being caused by directed energy weapons lazars do not have red beaming lines they're actually not seeable to the eye this is strongly controversial and is patented there are documents over this and video footage their doing this all around the world let's never forgot when nato forces indonesia into dirty work by creating artificial tsunamis japan is affected by heart quakes from threat from leaders who own the private bank corporation let's especially not forget how the only countries in the world who aren't under the world bank are the middle east and they are the only countries in a war a war started by you guessed it the ones who use these energy weapons artificial weather have been at war every single year for the past 0 years has every politician bought out and paid for is the united states of america's which is a corporation with a president and offices do note district of columbia is not a state do note we're born into debt through social security and by birth are expected to pay taxes to private shareholders in a federal reserve that's private you don't believe me you mustn't believe your self strong neglect because you're conditioned by birth to think on the contrary conversely though it's foreseen by thousands of government officials all of this disclosed information and other countries who suffer america is the laughing stock out of all of them we're blind to the truth and within blind faith we believe we are free our freedom is an illusion that our vote matters let alone count all of these problems resonate upon our disbelief it's even happening we are the reason all of this is happening because we settle and agree on it as a republic democracy we're a totalitarian corporate oligarchy sitting on a time bomb so far we can't even stand up if we stood up it would all blow up metaphorically if we all stood up together it would all collapse under the new world order in control by the elites of this world the bank owners rockefeller's rothschild corporations have long paid out politicians and government officials to carry out their agenda that's why you never see anything happen that's why you see things get changed and nothing goes through arnold s is right about things not going through but it's not him that's right he's carrying on a message he's advocating for it but he's not saying it these activists are using a little girl to carry out their information because they know the outcome corporate greed will destroy them and they will be homeless or if not last night so and so killed them selves/we're shot” like honestly y'all think epstein killed himself i knew this before memes came out before it even happened there's another field of activism going on behind the actual activism.,NOT
i guess i'm a transgender gay man because i lounge looking like a bum more than i dress up ‍♂ i'd understand if she was trying to say she is gender fluid but all her reasonings are not even valid...being trans or even gender-fluid has nothing to do with who you're attracted to nor does it have anything to do with gender stereotypes...,NOT
they should make a third gender in competitions transgenders vs transgenders solved or these men who are identifying as women should compete with what their biologically body is not who they identify as.,ABU
why don't they ever explain that they are comparing apples to oranges?? you have to compare the exact jobs against each other instead off comparing job titles,NOT
very well done on turning this one around i never thought i would see this happen.,NOT

remember carnage the movie simon amstell made a couple of years ago about a vegan future set in 067 watching this is like watching that movie except that it's real the vegan future really is coming! feeling very hopeful for 020.,NOT
so.. women get paid less because they become unreliable when they have kids.. how is that sexist i think women have a natural instinct to want to be with their kids.. of course it's already becoming more popular to have stay at home dads...,NOT
i'm slowly going back being vegan! wish me luck ,NOT
watch matt lush here on youtube he is a vegan also he knows alot  try veggie grill in la!,NOT
hmm to each it's own but because a man changes his clothes to woman clothes and chooses to sleep with men also in his mind he's a woman also mimics what he feels like a woman acts like now he's equal to a natural born woman even though naturally also his genetic is still male and if he still has or have had a prostate he's male,ABU
the truth is a micro-aggression.,NOT

oh my god yesyesyesyeyseys yay yay ayay ayayayya im so proud of u and try for a month thats when u rly see a differene,NOT
there is still a gender wage gap the video is very good the conclusion misses something however the best-paying specialties often require flexible hours in business for instance a high paying career is one that requires you to have a lot of meetings outside of your - routine given that women tend have more commitments at home than men they are not as free to shape their lives around their work like men so are there less women in high-paying jobs because they consciously dislike high-paying jobs and prefer lower-paying jobs no because we expect women to take care of the kids to make dinner to wash the clothes to take care of the house as a result men are more flexible than women as a result you wouldn't hire someone who can't be as commited and if you are expected to not be as commited you won't even consider these jobs this explains why in science and research careers for instance which don't require as much commitment outside of - hours women do just as well as men is it fair it's a different debate in my opinion yes it is see ya,NOT
you can eat all you care for on a hclf vegan diet  i have lost 0lbs!,NOT
links to studies?,NOT
this video actually states that the gender wage gap does exist it just says its ok it really annoys me when people don't understand that gender wage gap just means women on average get paid less than men not women who work at the same position as a man get paid less then men.,NOT

freelee is going to be responding to this with major thumbs up,NOT
my grandad told my mum she could only do a science degree because as a scientist himself he thought that was all that mattered and that it would give her better prospects she's not naturally gifted in sciences and would have enjoyed something like english or philosophy much more as that is what she's good at my mum has a decently paid job now but has low job satisfaction and always says she wishes she had been allowed to follow her passion this is what would have to happen on a societal scale to close the wage gap you're advocating for women to make choices they will regret for the rest of their lives.,NOT
trish you look so amazing that pink with your hair my gosh you're killing it girl!,NOT
yes trisha! i went vegan weeks ago and its great! the beginning can be a little confusing but once you get into the lifestyle it's amazing!,NOT
this is cheating boys compete with boys sorry.,ABU
this is so hurtful you dont get to choose i am trans and its so invalidating to hear an influencer thats confused and who doesnt know who they are yet causing damage to the community people like you make the community look like joke im not saying you arent trans but you are confused and you need to do your full research people look up to you and its so rude for you to go on the internet and spread the wrong messages because youre not educated yourself.,NOT
or women could just be more flexible with their hours like men are,NOT
i try not to be one sided but girls in my class still bully me.,NOT
the fact it does not exist,NOT
well the obvious solution is to have men get pregnant as well.. i mean we have to assume that more mothers are going to want to take time off to raise the child they made vs the fathers we have to make people women make people it takes a lot of dedicated time women are going to have less time to work/experience than men in the same age group the only way to make up for that disparity is to artificially inflate wages for women lets be honest that's what we're talking about right?,NOT
i think it's an issue that traditionally feminized and female-dominated fields like counselling nursing teaching are paid less than male-dominated fields like engineering and tech why do we pay teachers and counselors less when those feilds are just as if not more essential to society as stem jobs?,NOT
mr prager did you get demonized for this video?,NOT
ok if women were paid less then why arnt every jobs full o woooomeeeen,NOT
waiting for freele's reply,NOT
we are omnivores you idiots. where do you get b1 from in plants?,NOT

someone please link this on every fb feminazi page,ABU
this is so unfair for biological women these are men and no amount of estrogen will make them into women you can't change biology.,ABU
i appreciate the additional video on this topic it saddens me that it's always falling on deaf ears as those who would benefit from learning the truth are just too willfully ignorant to take any opposing view into genuine consideration.,NOT
get the app happy cow! it'll tell you all the vegan restaurants near you and i know you love eating out i'm sure la has some amazing vegan places ,NOT
instead of getting packaged fruit to eat get the whole thing like watermelon cantelope etc make tons of smoothies with frozen fruit and almond milk and spinach drink lots of ice water with lemon lime or cucumber and replace meat and dairy products with rice and beans salsa and condiments,NOT
i...am so confused right now,NOT
its like some kind of religion /,NOT
watching this eating carrots and peanut butter yum!,NOT
this is making my brain hurt,NOT
if you compare men and women in the same jobs men unequally earn promotions and make on average  more this video misses the point because even when you compare men and women with the same jobs education levels and backgrounds women make less regardless on the occupation choices of women as a whole.,NOT
realistically feminists are just going to forget about every fact stated in this video and go back to screaming like headless chickens in their lame ass parades,NOT
this is surprisingly neutral it's a refreshing change.,NOT

so you're saying that the gender pay gap has almost nothing to do with gender but more to do with hours and times worked life choices and the profession chosen yes thanks for confirming what rational people already knew ,NOT
well done add some beans lentils nuts for extra protein.,NOT
trisha like in my day to day life im a mess like i dont wear makeup and i have zits me wait... i dont identify myself as a dude but also i dont wear makeup and i have zits.......trisha hunny its called not wanting to put on makeup and its a natural thing for your body to have zits its not because you are a dude.,NOT
isn't it also illegal to pay people differently based on sex aren't female porn stars and models way better paid than men i mean there are no male supermodels.,NOT
no mention of the biggest driver of the pay gap motherhood this is a perfect example of a variable labelled as choice that really isn't one the fact that in 017 the us still proscribes to the breadwinner model is madness and the real reason women earn less than men and it is a sexist model no biological reason why women should be the primary caregivers not supported by any empirical evidence worth reading) the lack of affordable childcare access to acceptable maternity leave or good quality part-time work means that mothers are hugely disadvantaged when it comes to work employers are even likely to discriminate against women of childbearing ages simply because they might have kids now you might think hey having kids is a choice that many women benefit emotionally from so why shouldn't they get penalised economically for a personal choice?' there's two things wrong with that firstly it isn't true for thousands of women who have unplanned pregnancies and secondly having children benefits society especially a capitalist one that needs continuous growth to survive so we should be rewarding mothers not penalising them.,NOT
even though i don't agree with you about everything but i love you,NOT

trisha i love vegan chicken fingers the best brand is gardein you pop them in the oven for  minutes and they're great with condiments or in salads! they're not the healthiest but when you're craving something breaded and crispy they're a great option ben and jerry's also has non-dairy ice cream the chocolate brownie one is my favorite since you live in la you are at the center of bunches of amazing vegan restaurants!! you have got to go try some i would also love to watch a video of you trying different vegan foods taste test on your channel good luck!!,NOT
ok the wage gap does exist but not because of inequality it exists because women tend to not work as much as men do either due to children or by choice.,NOT
just made my year vegan anniversary and going to make my future kids vegan too hope the world realizes is the best change for your health and for mother earth 🏻‍♂️🌱🤞🏼🌍,NOT
mom has posted finally i love your videos.,NOT
being logical won't work in this situation she's obviously trolling.,NOT
no no!! don't tell the truth it does not fit into the rhetoric and the agenda of neo-feminists don't do it.,NOT
it's almost like you can't have everything you want just because you want it and there are consequences for your life choices weird.,NOT
i'm not an expert on the trans experience esp bc i am not trans myself but i see a lot of things that are problematic with what you're saying trish  if u don't feel happy being solely a woman but also id as a woman sometiems while simultaneously id'ing as a man then maybe what you're trying to say is that you're gender non conforming however when it comes to oh i want to be a guy bc they don't have the same expectation from society that doesn't justify wanting to be a man at least in my opinion) of course it's up to you how you want to id i don't want to silence you at all but i want to make sure you're saying these things as someone who's actually informed on what it means to be lgbtqia no hate for you just want you to be informed love you trish.,NOT
no one should be taking trisha seriously seriously.,NOT

made a youtube channel just to like this video thank you pbn,NOT
i really enjoyed the video but it ended off by saying that we can fix the wage cap by changing hours that's good and all but we must not deter from the true goal of viewing each other as equals remember everyone respect women!,NOT
the term she was looking for is bigender she just didn't know what terminology to use.,NOT
"""glistening in the wind ily",NOT
i'm so lost.,NOT
what happened to your instagram /,NOT
i'm pretty sure that if a women picks a dollar up off the ground that it's actually only worth  cents while if it were a man it would be a whole dollar as such i found myself in a particular issue when my year set of twins  male female brought up the wage gap difference to fix this i found that the average  tooth fairy gift per tooth would be balanced by my daughter being provided more coins to equal the values they are both super happy that i had talked to the tooth fairy for them the tooth fairy tends to leave a little extra though providing the 2.7 for my daughter while this is a little more than the proper balance of money from the wage gap which my son isn't too okay with i see no problems with it when they get older and i have to pay them to clean their rooms i'll probably end up doing the same thing as the tooth fairy that way everything is fair.,NOT
i wonder how many of these petulant man children in the comments actually watched the video to realise that their bickering is pointless and irrelevant to what is being presented here.,NOT
ok i'm all for lgbt but this is not fair at all.,NOT
so to fix it all we have to do is stop having kids right that way men and women can be exactly the same.,NOT
gosh society have became stupid,ABU
no just no identify as a women fine your choice but now you're forcing everyone to not only tolerate the genetic lie but actually feed the lie it allows her to be she wants to be i want to fly like a plane i can't cause i wasn't born a plane i can still say i'm a plane i guess 🏻‍♀️,NOT
if they feel they are really earning it and feel they are not cheating guess this comes with the change and acceptance we are all gonna have to deal some changes in making the world equal.,NOT
this is all hypocritical nonsense if gender is only a social construct then it follows all sports should be competed by males/females/others all together the fact they don't combine male/female shows the whole charade is nonsense.,NOT
well i don't wear makeup on a regular basis.. i guess that i identify as a male now,NOT
i don't think this is right but don't girls usually run faster anyway?,NOT
you know what people can say freelee just bullies and doesnt work and doesnt help the vegan movement but look at trish literally the last person we ever thought now giving it a go you go girl!,NOT
i'm confused she says that she was born a female but she identifies as a boy but she looks completely like a girl,NOT
i'm sorry but this whole vid smells like bullshit trish.,NOT
how can you eat that food and still maintain your figure i can't eat out more than once or twice a month otherwise my gut expands all the way to boston one piece of fried chicken makes my ass jiggle for like a week.,NOT

the wage gap is fake look it up,NOT
blaire you look so pretty in softer lighting when you were cutting back between yourself and trisha i couldn't help thinking...well-done plastic surgery vs badly-done plastic surgery just sayin',NOT
do you get maternity pay in usa in britain women always had longer time off than men but it's been fixed now so men and women can share the maternity leave so the woman has the right to go strait back into work as soon as she has given birth and the man can stay at home to raise the child obviously the women might need a week off after giving birth but that shouldn't affect her career,NOT
if the wage gap exists why would any reasonable company hire men if women could do the same work for less the answer the gap doesn't exist.,NOT
i want to be vegan but it's almost impossible with a family that eats meat like everyday,NOT
okay so i don't know who the clown at :2 is but he is just embarrassing.,NOT
lol freelee is probably ecstatic about this.,NOT

girl. normally i can defend you a little bit but it was wrong for you to title this video i am transgender female to male) and then claim to identify as a bisexual woman some days and a gay man the other you could've titled this i am gender fluid instead of making such a bold statement that you don't even stand by 00  you support the lgbt community and provide reasons to not take transgender people seriously  i cant,NOT
feminists would complain that the reason why women are only in of the fields that pays the best are because they are women.,NOT
piers the twat is anti vegan that's positive promotion for veganism.,ABU
these prager u vids are an enigma to me one can be a thoughtful fact-based argument there is no gender wage gap war on boys feminism .0 and the next can be an unfactual highly-opinionated rant dangerous people are teaching your kids everyone should stand for the national anthem) you guys definitely keep me guessing if nothing else.,NOT
mmmmmmoney money money money money money _money money money_,NOT
she's not vegan anymore it lasted like one day lol,NOT
if u want a frappe get soy milk or coconut and no whip cream you can do this i've been vegan for year today sp proud of you and peanut butter dates and tofu have lots of protein put them in smoothies and its easy to bloat at first but it will go down its important to eat enough to get your b1 vitamin in you and if you don't you could feel sick and non energized if you are doing things right you should feel more energized!! love you good job you go girl!,NOT
hmmm choices maybe it's not really choices but gender roles embedded in our society that in turn control or substantially affect these choices why do women chose majors like teaching or counseling or nursing because those are the roles/majors women are generally expected to be interested in by choosing these majors they are less likely to have to compete with males and more likely to get the job when it comes to jobs like attorney ceo so forth these are jobs predominantly maintained by males and women are more likely to have to compete with them why does this competition matter if the woman is just as good an applicant oh because women are thought to have to pick up the kids when their sick be home in time to pick the kids up from school and have kids which means paid maternity leave and the list goes on thereby lessening the hours she can work and making her less competitive that also answers the hours question.,NOT
transgender woman vs male boxing who would win ,NOT
best decision you'll ever make so proud of you yay!,NOT

but after years of abuse on your body you may not lose the weight instantly i suffered from binge eating and processed food and it took about months for my body to heal and start loosing weight,NOT
people can be non-binary or gender fluid without seeking attention it's more validation and it's also not a fad i just think there just wasn't a term for it before and now that there is people are using it what trish is doing on the other hand is for attention unfortunately for her is she's trolled and cried wolf so many times no one takes her seriously or even actually cares anymore.,NOT
so in simple terms if you really want to get rid of the wage gap women need to stop having kids and work the same hours with the same level of flexibility as men do problem solved next problem please!,NOT

elizabeth warren pays her female staff on average a median income of  percent of her male staff now she has five men who are in high level positions and this skews the numbers she has a lot of lower-level female staffers who make less and this skews the numbers elizabeth warren does not pay women less money for doing the same job she is not a sexist who pays women less for doing the same job rather her staff gender gap reflects differences in jobs however when she looks at the economy she believes women are making less money for doing the same jobs as men this is why nobody should ever be taken seriously who says equal pay for equal work as if this is what the numbers mean.,NOT

the weaknesses of the video are as follows they still insinuated that discrimination was a factor as they failed to mention otherwise they didn't talk about wage negotiation they neglected to mention that most women choose to raise children and yes there are studies that give a clear indication that both men and women prefer this to working so it is indeed a privilege for women to do so) and perhaps most importantly they failed to mention that these industry-specific differences are literally everything to do with specialisation and earned promotion.,NOT

its simple.. dont have children and work the jobs that men work and you wont get paid less this whole gender wage gas bs never takes into the account the amount of men that die in the process of making all that extra money you know for the life of me i've never seen a woman that works in the field of heavy demolition and hazmat...(might have something to do with the fact you have to strip all your cloths off and run around in a paper thin tyvek suit with a papr mask for - hrs per day all while sweating your ass off all day long(or freezing it off.. it can go both ways there is no happy medium in between) our modern economy isnt based off of paying people to do basically nothing and in terms of employers its not their responsibility to pay women more because they have less free time to actually work in life its your personal choices that determine what your net worth is and if you personally think being a single mother(or whatever the case is entitles you to somehow make more money for doing less work for another individual/company your delusional thats just not how things work in north america and for that you can blame capitalism.,NOT
men and women make different choices even that study that compares house hold chores with full time working parents doesn't take into account that while the work is considered full time the men are working insanely more hours especially when full time in these studies is pegged at 5-4 hours men routinely will work 0 hours in their jobs women value flexibility over pay this has been proven in countless surveys and studies yet vox seems to think that you should be able to have flexible hours aka not work as much but some how he paid the same there is no discrimination going on there is no social conditioning in a master patriarchal scheme to make women think they want flexible hours men and women make different choices and that's ok stop creating discontent where it is not warranted women in the west are the freest and liberated people's on the globe just stop it.,NOT

did you make this video to test the conservative point of view i've been in the work force for  years and yes there's a gender wage gap to use an argument such as men are willing to be on call at all times etc is why they're paid more is not valid women who work the same long hours and are available at all hours get paid less period companies wouldn't hire just women to save the 5 because they still believe men can do a better job even if it costs more.,NOT
you are doing a justice to the world by making this video.,NOT
 dudes ran in a girls race nope not fair andre and terrence should not have been allowed to race against these girls,ABU
the main reasons there's a wage gap between men and women  women have more paid time off work compared to men when they have children this creates a debt to the companies that pay them  more women leave work or reduce their hours to spend more time in a homemaker role compared to men making it difficult for firms to earn back the extra debt that women create compared to men meaning that women are taxed as a gender to pay back the debt that is created by the entire gender which is also why the wage gap closes towards their later years because they can put more time into work instead of homemaking)  men are more competitive and aggressive due to our naturally higher testosterone levels which means men are more likely to take risks apply for the higher paid jobs more productive in highly stressful work environments more likely to have the skills for senior level positions and are wayyy better at asking and negotiating pay rises not saying women can't do these things just a higher proportion of men are capable of it than women).,NOT
the one with the braids look like his name is de andre.,ABU
a big issue that is often missed every company i've ever worked for has had many women who have refused promotions because the male spouse was self employed ie plumbers electricians etc) the main goal was more about providing benefits like health and retirement that a self-employed spouse could not provide.,NOT

mkay mkay so females can't be competitive males don't respect women aaannd all straight men are masculine and all gay men are feminine hhhhhhhhhhhhhgh,NOT
not that you ever read my comments anyways however i will say i've tried the vegan thing just all fruit and you can still gain weight if you're not like freelee riding a damn bicycle  miles or more daily you're not working on anything you're eating so it doesn't matter what you're eating so being vegan or vegetarian for that matter does not matter as far as losing weight stopping the dairy not eating red meat will certainly help you but you still should count calories and watch your intake eat lots of protein you can do this trish do it for the animals i've always thought of being vegan also why i haven't started and or started and kept doing it i don't know one day i do love those people who are vegans one for what they stand for when it comes to the animals however there's a lot of drama going on in the vegan community and i won't say any names or anything else but i am sometimes scared of becoming a vegan because i'm afraid it will turn me into a real bitch lol,NOT
for me personally i love starches more than sweets many vegans thrive on a fruity diet but for myself personally i enjoyed reading the starch solution by doctor mcdougall it resonates with me more just try multiple things as long as you are eating mostly whole foods you will feel better and be healthier make sure you are eating enough!! many people arent used to eating so much but vegan whole foods aren't very calorie dense so you need to eat more and throughout the day eat lots of veggies and fruits potatoes are your friends  most vegans tend to eat high carb low fat good luck and persevere!,NOT

why are they still pushing this agenda the pay gap has been debunked time and time again yet there is a trending topic about it on google and youtube.,NOT

"if a woman doesn't like the idea of taking the time and energy and making the sacrifices to raise her own kids why have them if it happens anyway there are so many couples would happily take and raise them that there is no problem there but if she has bought into the idea that she must have it all or else she must resent all men and if making as much or more money as her husband is more important then pay someone else to raise them or me and i mention the husband because the video does) daycare workers will never love or treat those children like their own and they come and go so the sense of abandonment starts young and telling them they shouldn't feel it is about the adults feelings not theirs ever heard the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world"" in case you need that spelled out it means that the person who spends the most time with and talking to/guiding children is the one who actually raises them not the one who simply houses them pays the bills eats dinner with them if even that and gives the biggest gifts) he or she develops the closest relationship and passes on their values and beliefs and thus naturally has the greatest influence on what the kids will do with their lives thus that person becomes the hand. i'm old enough to have seen many many outcomes of both ways and there's no going back or do-overs, and no amount of sorry's change things) so we made the choice to be the ones to love and raise ours and i'd be that hand who was there knowing the financial challenges and i am so glad we did it was worth every struggle and that's what i tell them you are worth more than any amount of money i could have made. yes kids raised by others usually still love their parents but when talking with them many wistfully and with repressed guilt say they wish they could have had something like what we did for ours but that they'd never tell their mom because it would just make her feel bad so they carry the painful burden quietly kids have enough pain in this world so why add to it if it's for a point of pride for the philosophy a choice to be financially richer and have more stuff at their expense my boss and co-workers would not remember me long after i am gone would not likely be there for me when i am old and feeble and need help or visit me regularly if i am in hospital send cards call or text or put flowers on my grave i'd never imagine being a stereotypical passive-aggressive guilt mom who overtly or subtly makes them feel bad for holding me back and being the reason i couldn't achieve my feminist dream. whoa nice thing to pass onto your kids eh oh and if this guilt-trips you at least you are an adult and can handle it better than a child.",NOT

this is an insult to the whole trans community she's mocking the meaning and struggle of being trans and obviously has no clue what she's talking about weather it's a joke or not it's still discusting that she thinks this is appropriate to post that isn't the only problem with the video she's heavily gender stereotyping and being sexist i am so sick and tired of her trolling and desperate cries for attention.,NOT
im exactly the same with freelee with the fact of animal slaughter.,NOT
it doesn't matter if it's 7 cent or 9 cent it's still not fair to women i have female friends in the work place that get paid less than men it's hapoeninb in my school it doesn't matter if it's one cent it still can make a big difference.,NOT
if she actually sticks with it and becomes a vegan it shows that literally anyone can do it really proud of her for going for it ❤,NOT
but you couldn't even eat your vegetables at the korean barbecue ,NOT

still not sure why i keep getting chicken ads with freelees videos....,NOT
you and metal music is a pretty hot combo just saying really nice touch at the end!,NOT
omg i got really excited when i realized you weren't joking i recently went vegan myself i will never go back i wouldn't recommend going vegan right away i went vegetarian first while also trying lots of vegan food to find out what i liked find good meat dairy replacements i've been on the road to veganism for about a year a half just recently went vegan just know you can eat anything as a vegan there are vegan versions of everything you just gotta find the good stuff if all you eat is fruit you will gain weight unless you work out a lot it was hard for me at first but once i stopped trying recipes from pinterest it got a lot easier lol check out channels like hot for food may's test kitchen they make amazing vegan food yesterday i just had my first vegan donuts for my birthday they were amazing so don't think you have to give up junk food either my diet is pretty healthy but i'm not gonna give up junk food altogether if i can go vegan anyone can i never even ate vegetables til i was in my 0's going vegan has also helped with some health problems i've had i just started sharing some of my favorite vegan meals on facebook you're welcome to check then out i can't post a link but it's facebook dot com 22nicolerenee i have an album of vegan meals that i've been adding to weekly there's only a few but i'm gonna be adding a lot soon i wish you the best of luck!,NOT
trisha isn't even capable of being a vegetarian let alone a vegan!!,NOT

she's at it as well???,NOT
well yeah einstein of course you get paid less if you work less...why do you make a video about such a simple thing?,NOT
it's a pay gap not a wage gap.,NOT
you guys do a fantastic job thank you!,NOT
my mother is a personal trainer she makes around minimum wage my father is a plant manager he pays for just about everything my mother chose to switch from the factory work my dad stayed in after having my sister she wanted a more flexible schedule so she could be able to take care of us she went and got her dream job dad is usually on call can work up to  hours on a bad day and on a good one he has been at the same place for almost  years if he could he would get an easier lower paying job but he can't afford to my fiancee is a mechanic he makes 2 an hour unlicensed when he writes his test it could jump to  0 when we have kids he could be close to 40/hr i am going into medical office administration while it can eventually pay in the 20s i will never earn as much as him unless i end up being promoted or get extra schooling i am at a disadvantage though when kids happen we both want me to be stay at home until the last kid is in school so that's a lot of years of advancement i lose this is my choice in the end no matter what a woman who wants a family will end up sacrificing more time even if just to birth and recover what we need to do is encourage women to try trades and high academic pursuit shared maternity leave or father maternity leave fathers as stay at homes seriously if you could afford it who wouldn't love time off. or even when you are staying home and on leave taking classes related to your field to keep your knowledge current i believe that if we want to we can close the tiny gap left and all be happy.,NOT
next step trisha finally gets a puppy!! d,NOT

when you piss of both feminazis and meninists you know you've done something right,NOT
totally missing the point here there is 00 a gender pay gap though smaller than 3 difference between men and women even with factors such as education level age race and job title in every country around the world i think the reason for this is more biological than social such as men naturally having more risk-taking tendencies such as asking for promotions and women naturally having more caregiving tendencies such as devoting more of their time to household duties.,NOT
there is wage gap because men is doing better not because of discrimination for same job experience and hours of work women gets payed same as men,NOT
it's nonsense like this that makes me think maybe bullies are a good thing” then i remember that i never really got bullied during the  year of my life spent in socal and didn't turn out like trisha there so…,NOT
women and men get paid the same for the same work,NOT
don't be vegan!!! i love the fuck-off binge mukbang vids too much 😂😂,NOT

omg yes trishaaaaa,NOT
i never find obviously gay men hot i've had coworkers or class mates think they're hot but i don't can't explain it.,NOT
there isn't any wage gap in the businesses but there is a skill and experience gap between the genders in the society some of this gap is caused by biology some are caused by social pressure.,NOT
smoothies really help and are convenient for getting enough nutrition and that shit i'm vegan),NOT
"trisha...there's a such difference as identifying with and identifying as""",NOT
you guys she is a gay man trapped in a woman's body so she makes the best of the body she's born in annnd lives as a drag queen.. because she's a gay man... trapped in a girls body... duuuuuh. disclaimer this comment was intended at poking fun of trisha... not gonna lie.. and not intended to promote hate on her or any other group of people who wish to identify as whatever they seem fit ,NOT

"""the truth is that women take on a disproportionate share of child-rearing tasks. oh you mean like pregnancy and breast feeding two things men physically cannot do this isn't sexism vox its just a natural outcome of the roles that biology has assigned males and females.",NOT
sorry but i think you just are jealous of how males are in society like you are jealous that men can be assertive and not be a bitch you are jealous that you don't need makeup or hair done and it not be frowned upon you don't want to be hit on by weird guys like most people don't want that this doesn't mean you are trans you just like the idea of being a guy cus they are treated better in society idk but i think that's how ur felling🤷‍♀️,NOT
"good video i did not expect a description of reality i was on high alert for pandering and mis-information and was pleasantly surprised though i will say until women prefer men who stay home and find value in homelife there will continue to be disproportionate home-work responsibility disparities hypergamy exists cross culturally and racially and is one of the contributing factors that men for better or worse place a higher importance on working all the time""/""being a provider to attract a mate poise themselves for a family.",NOT

this is all coming from someone who took the 0 layers challenge to a whole new damn level of disgusting a couple years ago.. granted we don't speak of such things because we don't dare to be scarred even through the ear for life about what she did in that video.. just . *vomits,NOT
so stop calling it a wage gap and start calling it an earnings gap.,NOT
trisha you are mentally ill this is nothing to be ashamed of rather the opposite often times but for your sake i think you should talk to someone.,ABU
maybe u shouldnt talk shit about stuff you dont want to actually learn about genderfluid allgendered are real identities.,NOT
woo hoo lets make change happen this decade },NOT
is that why she dated jason 😂,NOT
don't give in to the eat as much as you want if it's vegan mentality it's extremely unhealthy also moral absolutionism will hinder you more than help and since you're not fully a vegan for moral reasons if it's extremely hard for you to avoid animal products if youre out with friends or something then just do it if you're comfortable with that) good luck in the next two weeks!,NOT
she's a human who likes to do drag as a male,NOT

her eyebrows different sizes,NOT
"you mean an earnings gap"" pay gap wage gap is misleading and close to intellectual dishonest also sticking to the premises that the earnings gap is bad for women is odd since you don't really explain why it's bad.",NOT
you should definitely try to look up fast food vegan options or cupcake places for the long term but for right now id suggest eating lots of fruit/veggies mostly you can easily find meat/cheese/etc substitutes but fruit is probably the best option for you trying to lose weight quickly also if you spend a whole day eating fruit youre going to be bloated by the night! its not bad trust me its all gone by the time you wake up!,NOT
listen i don't get paid for taking care of my cat so why should you get paid for taking care of your kid you don't have to have a kid you know(unless rape) so the only people to blame are yourselves if that's your excuse don't get me wrong this goes to everyone stay at home dads are increasing over the years.,NOT
tldw women earn less money than men because they work fewer hours.,NOT

the fact that we still have to talk about this...,NOT
we had feminism to give women choice we have feminism again because most women didn't choose to go into stem jobs?,NOT
vox actually reported on this issue honestly once i'm.. shocked pleasantly shocked but shocked nonetheless.,NOT
the wage gap does exist but it's not about women getting paid less it's about women choosing jobs that pay less than men do why do women choose lesser paying jobs it's not because they need more time to take care of their kids not every woman has a child it's because of the way women are raised if you walk into the girls toy section of a store it's filled with baby dolls and lots of other toys that are associated with taking care of children and things that are considered feminine other videos about the wage gap will point it out women go into pediactrics over brain surgery all the time i'm sure there's more but i'm not aware enough of the job market right now to know if this wasn't a sexist problem then women wouldn't be choosing lesser jobs than men in the first place.,NOT
the wage gap is a myth!!!,NOT
as a vegan i don't recommend freelee's diet its pretty crazy just eat normally minus animal products i mean for those who love her diet more power to you but i have tried it and i hate it so you just have to find what works for you,NOT
carb up trish that's what i love most about being vegan i eat all the carbs i want and don't gain a pound when i was eating meat and dairy i looked like i was pregnant also breakfast tons of cereal are vegan use almond or cashew milk silk has a yummy thick chocolate cashew milk that my hubbs loves also oatmeal sweet potatoes with almond butter omg ancient veganic bread for sandwiches i like veggie sandwiches or tofurkey) you tube bananna icecream aoolea with almond butter and honey on top there are tons of yummy things have fun with it and eat things you enjoy good luck,NOT

hey freelee love your channel and you spreading the vegan message i was wondering if you could do a video on maddi bragg she's a young youtuber and has a large fan base 1. million followers on instagram) mostly of young girls like herself she has been promoting the use of animal products and in her latest vlog she has even been supporting zoos it would really be great if you can open her and her fan bases eyes to the cruelty.,NOT

the lgbt community completely baffles me for years people have actually taken their lives and spent their lives representing the community so they can be accepted and not judged treated the same way which i'm all for but then when the community finally gets somewhere they turn around well i say they i shouldn't group everyone together i mean a few certain others like blaire they turn around and say no .. you can't be that your this your not allowed because that's what everyone else is like y'all baffle me if you want to be accepted you probably shouldn't be turning around telling others what they are and aren't allowed to be ........... get your sh|t straight no pun intended),NOT

best explanation of the fake gender wage gap i'm so glad i continued to watch this since it was merely an ad on another video it's all spot on thank you for sharing!,NOT
fuck it i'm going vegan well i'll try,NOT
the gender wage gap pales in comparison to the wage gap for workers with disabilities workers with disabilities earn for every dollar their non-disabled colleagues make 4 so yeah the gender wage gap sucks but the disability wage gap is a travesty.,NOT
but isn't that the point of the wage gap to show that there is an overall difference in compensation yes of course that is not because some evil managers want to pay less money but because of personal choices which are a direct product of influences from our society there is a wage gap though it is not a matter of paying more or less but of a social issue that makes woman and men tend to different carreer choices i guess some people manipulate everything it's just a shamr because the concept behind it is nice and would help both woman and men.,NOT

your body will likely not transform in two weeks but eating mostly fruit and veggies will do wonders for your skin and digestion that said somebody else in the comments said not to eat only raw fruit and veg to start and i'd agree cause it will probably be too abrupt a change to stick to if you seriously want to try out the diet and help your health and aesthetics long term i'd start by going to vegan restaurants and trying well prepared vegan meals even the ones with fake meats cheese etc if you're adventurous and eating fruit and veg at home also it would be a good idea to allow yourself some vegan sweets as a transition i'm not a vegan activist and i'm not writing this to you because of your reach i've been dealing with disordered eating on and off for the last  years and since i went vegan some months ago so much in my body and mind has changed for the better yes i've lost a bit of fat too) and i hope it does for you too good luck.,NOT
she's just not well-versed about the queer community and a lot of people aren't i think maybe trisha could be non-binary/gender queer but it's a big step to say one is trans i mean everyone has different journeys but being trans or any sexuality or gender shouldn't be announced on a whim or for clout.,NOT

"""it's not sexism it's common sense lmao big facts.",NOT
people keep wanting to put feelings first yes i understand you're a transgender girl and that's your gender identity but you must understand that there is an obvious biological advantage that comes with being biologically born male like the woman said in the video men produce a lot of testosterone which increases the production of red blood cells that absorbs more oxygen enables men to develop larger skeletal muscles and develop larger hearts these give men a larger aerobic advantage so no transgender girls who are biologically men cannot and should not be allowed to compete with cisgender girls because of the obvious unfairness.,ABU

look women have fought hard to have their place in sports and still are but it's a difficult topic of is it fair to either group to me in strength and stamina women are at their own level and men have theirs however with these transgender students it's difficult to know where their strengths place above or below the girls team a possible solution could be to make a group for transgender athletes one solution i'm against taking those transgender students completely out of sports because it's not fair everyone has a right to partake in something that makes them happy it's like with the first woman who ran in the boston marathon and she did it no man could stop her and no one should stop these kids from running i see the girls standpoint of fairness and i also see the trans-girls standpoint of inclusiveness within the sport.,NOT

i gained weight when i was a vegan/vegetarian i was always hungry that food went right through me but not quite because i was also bloated) plus my hair thinned out and my skin went to hell i was anemic and hypoglycemic if trish has pcos which many overweight women do all those carbohydrates will make that worse let's just say it doesn't agree with everyone bland and unsatisfying food will just make binge eating and cheating worse freelee rides her bike like crazy yet seems to leave that out when she is talking about her weight loss .,NOT

that fucking thumbnail,NOT
"if two people have the same demand from other workplaces same experience same education same grades same connections and in every single way are identical to the workplace then they should get the same salary per hour that's simple the wage gap in many cases if not most) comes because women value family time and social time higher than men do they also on average have more sick days than men do then you have the whole baby making period in the 0-4 year period for women.. if a man and a woman started out fresh out of university at the same job and same salary the statistics tell us that a man will sacrifice family time and social life to work more all these extra hours give more experience more connections and you'll be more in demand by workplaces because of that in return that gives you a higher salary likewise a career woman that did all the same sacrifices that the man did will be similarly payed for their experience however another difference in men and women also determines their salaries and that's how much they demand a man will typically not be afraid of conflicts or stress in salary negotiations where as a woman will typically fold earlier and get a lower salary why because men are psychologically plugged or trained/influenced while growing up that men don't quit and women you have to sit pretty"" is it right or wrong neither each and everyone has their life to control if you want a career and rise to the top you have to sacrifice something if you want a family and time for kids and a lot of friends then you have to sacrifice something else biologically and psychologically we're predisposed to certain things as a man i would love to be a stay at home dad and take care of the kids house and things like that however i work in education which also satisfy my desire to be around kids and teach with that comes many different advantages and disadvantages just like other types of work or lifestyles do point is that everyone needs to stop looking to blame others for their own shortcomings or sacrifices money isn't the only thing wealth can be measured in some  year old man or woman that sacrificed family and friends in order to build their career might have money but they don't have the same social life or family bonds again you pick what you want ..don't blame anyone else for that.",ABU

you will probably gain wheigt but when your body gets that you're not starving yourself any more it will stop storage food so in the long run you will loose wheigt  and btw welcome to our secret little vegan club/love tin,NOT

but my college professor with a ph.d says she's right about the wage gap.,NOT
trisha i don't like being harassed my straight guys is this being transgender?,NOT
look it's not just we look different on the outside we're different inside aswell women are designed to carry children men are designed to defend the pregnant women making us faster and stronger just by nature we need to cut the shit and stop alouing these kids to do crap like this those guy's are taking opportunitys away from leget girls i bet there not even fast that's why they wanted to race girls,ABU
she's trolling and you all are retarded,NOT
im quite confused why would sjws get so bitchy when it is proven that the wage gap doesnt exist i know that most of them are whining like children about their other problems but i dont see the need to be whiny when proven that the discrimination of pay didnt exist.,ABU

trisha is crack cocaine in human form.,ABU
honestly i don't think she's trans but she definitely is going through some sort of identity crisis abd i think she's trying to figure out what's going on in her head which is fine to do but she should not be public about it without knowing for sure if she's trans or not and all of her wild ideas of herself she just shouldn't be so open abiut that stuff on the internet bc is can hurt her and others,NOT
not as radical as i expected but the argument is limp dicked,NOT
cue freelee response vid rolls eyes,NOT
my sister dont believe me say that there a huge gap men get paid more just because there men,NOT
im not a vegan but i will be posting vegan recipes because most of my dinners coincidentally are vegan not a fan of meat,NOT
to be fair there are misogynist people in some positions of power who tend to not promote women as readily not employ them or discriminate against them in other ways it really does happen and it's not a thing that should happen and this could explain parts of a wage gap however most people aren't like that and you don't tackle an issue effectively by exaggerating it to the point of absurdity and thus ruining your credibility in the public eye like most feminists these days do).,NOT
only meat eater here,NOT
im sorry but f*k you!!!,ABU
always always be smart and ask questions when you go out to eat don't buy animal products just because the rest of ur friends are you have to keep motivated and with veganism your have to eat a larger volume of food to get more calories because plant foods are less calorie dense.. which is sometimes the reasons why you can get full easier since ur stomach is much more filled up than with a small piece of meat at the bottom of your stomach and also keep track of vitamin intake you're most likely going to lack in vitamin b1 so maybe purchase a supplement or fortified foods to help overcome that and also a lot of plant foods contain non-heme iron which is harder to absorb than heme iron(in meats but to fix that you need to keep up your vitamin c levels orange juice vitamin gummies in order to absorb it more efficiently and protein should be fine if you eat more lentils and quinoa(especially quinoa because it is a perfect protein).that's my advice for u good luck!,NOT
the pay gap is even lower and almost non existent in countries with better maternity leave pay than the us that helps bring the average pay of those women up while theyre having kids,NOT
so glad i'm vegan and will be for the rest of my life 🌱✌️,NOT

you go girl!💙🌷,NOT
as a left-leaning individual i can say that this is a very well-done video this kind of content is exactly why i subscribe to prageru and would love to see more of because it uses facts and research as opposed to anecdotes to challenge a particular view it could only be made better if they were to cite every claim they make and link in the description so we can follow up on them there are certainly other videos by prageru that do make me suspicious of the source and i feel a better argument could be made if those were cited left-leaning because i'd rather not identify by party because neither side is 00 correct on everything and to place that label on yourself is to put yourself into a box where you feel pressure to defend your ideology's world view as opposed to your personal world view.,NOT
take that feminazis,ABU
this is sick i cannot even believe thee young ladies have to suffer because two teenage boys are confused about their identities thus stealing there chances at obtaining scholarships this has got to stop and transgenders should start their own league.,ABU

okay have you ever heard of a tomboy this video actually pissed me off.,NOT
the video is factional and all but.. how could you miss the way race ability etc affect the wage gap latinas in the u.s make like 0 less than white women and nearly half of what white men make.. this video seems to consider white women most of all and it's even reflected in the clips of working women.,NOT

i'm sorry trish i love you but i don't think you will succeed i really hope you do don't get me wrong but it wouldn't be the first time you started a diet/workout regimen and gave up after less than a week.,NOT
i'm so happy for you just eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full substitutes for meat and dairy aren't the best things for you but they definitely help with the transition two weeks may not give you a ton of results but it is a start anyway just try getting a lot of fruit and veggies and watch a few vegan youtubers for some recipes you can make just about anything vegan.,NOT

i can't believe this bitch got a mermaids ad but actually dysphoric and transition trans youtubers don't get ads,ABU
although you know that you can eat as many calories as you want it's extremely important that you do eat much more on the plant-based than you would on a diet including meat or dairy when i first switched to a plant-based diet i was eating just as regularly as i was while eating meat and dairy i was craving those things because they are so filling and i was frustrated however all of my cravings disappeared when i started eating more plant-based foods just a pointer for if you ever go through the same thing i'm so proud of you trish ,NOT
i mean this is coming from the same person who seriously wondered if dogs had brains,NOT

is she going to throw out most of her shit?,NOT

"feminists antivax and flat earthers seem to do the same thing purposely misinterpret info pick the only article that supports them even when there's  that say why they are wrong and try to pull the uneducated or look at these obviously fake statics and pretend they are right"".",NOT

have you seen her mess of an apology video?? i feel like she's not trolling anymore and it makes me really sad you should reach out to her and have like a conversation she needs help and i think whatever gender therapist she's seeing doesn't know wtf they're talking about.,ABU
i commend vox for making these kind of vids in spite of how sexist the youtube community/comment section can be sometimes and dealing with the sexist backlash,NOT
male logic translation women make choices that affect their income negatively while men do whatever it takes to clime the corporate ladder the wage gap is a myth here is proof if you are a c.e.o and you can hire women at  cents on the hour to the dollar an hour a man works for the same output in labor who will you hire if you want to get rich the answer will always be the woman since she is cheaper labor that is simple economics folks the reason that woman are not dominating the workforce because of this logical choice is because they make decisions that adversely affect their work performance taking time off to raise kids and inflexible schedules is bad for business so you make less for those reasons ladies no man is oppressing you you did it to yourselves so maybe quit blaming your bad choices on men ok also just so we are clear paying a woman less for the same work is discrimination and there are laws against it since you never hear of women winning lawsuits then these companies obviously are not in violation of said law so your wage gap argument is invalid.,NOT
ah prager u.. even a broken clock is right twice a day.,NOT

for wage gap you need to find a man and a woman with the exact same qualifications and exact same working hours in the exact same job and compare them,NOT
earnings gap not a wage gap if you could pay a woman less to do the same job then every company would hire women.,NOT

"gardein products are great especially as you transition and might struggle to come up with meal ideas you can not eat as many calories as you want i've found that to be very misleading in this community use an online calorie calculator to get a general idea of what you should be eating or better yet get your rmr tested and know for sure how many calories your body burns at rest still pay attention to your macros at each meal nothing crazy just try to include a healthy protein at each meal) <this is what has worked for me you'll get ,00 different answers but you'll have to tweak it to find what works best for you -)",NOT
try gardien fishless and chik'in products!,NOT
how can a vegan get b1 if b1 supplement comes from animals?,NOT

men are faster than women they are biological males period.,ABU
let's all stop bashing trisha for everything i understand that she needs to be held accountable for her actions but in saying that i think this is a huge step and we should all support her in this time of change as opposed to tearing her down.,NOT

i've never seen your videos before but i instantly like you lol,NOT
the liberals ruin everything they touch.,NOT
women are also knocking senseless the graphic design field as we speak my teacher(male was rightfully concerned about the competition that awaits him in a few years.,NOT
but why not work towards more equal division of labor in childcare obviously there's no institutional way to do that but it seems much more effective than flexibility in hours that isn't even feasible in many fields.,NOT
so the earnings gap is due to women's choices is what you're saying women more often choose not to go for jobs if they have to work less flexible hours whereas men more often choose to go for those jobs fair and square no problem there.,NOT
crazy how vox has ignored this video completely also there is no wage gap it is an earnings gap don't bring up the race gap” it is illegal the equal pay act of 96 made that illegal,NOT
i dont want to be vergan because i love chicken ),NOT

try imitation meat! you can season it however you want and it is so good for people who are trying to cut out meat i've been vegan for about five months and balancing meals have been that hardest part carb up every morning! eat bigger portions of carbs so that you don't get weak from hunger.,NOT
how much of the gap is explained by the lack of standardized paid maternal leave in the us that's one of the main things i was hoping to find out i'm not angling for a certain number or anything if it's negligible that's fine but i was hoping it would get mentioned if only briefly.,NOT
if you like green tea starbucks green tea frappaccino without whipped cream is vegan and delicious!,NOT
i had to pause the video and say your body is so bomb i saw your waist and just..jaw dropped i'm envious,NOT
trisha isn't going vegan she was just stuffing her face at the cheesecake factory last weekend she made that video for views surprise surprise).,NOT
so the wage gap exist but not because the world is sexist or patriarchal but because women are usually the one who takes care of the childrens and that effect the wage someone please tell that to those sjw liberals and fake feminist who hate men.,NOT

this is the most informative and inspiring film i have ever seen.,NOT
"there's still a huuge gap if you look up how much the employees earn per hour* plus,women also don't get promoted as easily as man and the wage gap during their child rearing years just shows how the market is unfriendly towards mothers who want to work and take care of their children at the same time(i'm talking about what they learn per hour) working mothers are seen as women denying their responsibility of child rearing however it's the opposite for working fathers they receive empathy from their bosses and have a higher wage than average men but what if the working mother is a single mom how is she supposed to raise her children alone and earning half of what a man earns per hour this video is also very misleading and disappointing even if you say that it's only temporary,in other developed countries,like japan,the wage gap actually widens even more after the thirties,and reaches its peak at fifties and years of reduced make a huge difference on a woman's life we should stop trying to excuse ourselves and start working on solving the problem we created.",NOT
im watching this video while eating kfc 😂😂😂gawd im disrespectful,NOT

i'm more than accepting of who people are and who they want to be but this is unfair and to be quite frank its bull sh what about the more physical sports like soccer.. biological girls are going to get hurt and they sit there acting as if they're taking a stand.. smh this is a form of cheating,ABU
whoever did her make up did a great job i loved it it brought up her beautiful features😄,NOT
damn what about the self esteem of the girls they are crushing.thats a life long sting so how do you jutify that.or the girls that want to run but dont even try because of the unfairness make a transgender category and they can run against each other they are not girls they are trans.transformers more than meets the eye sorry couldn't resist,ABU
trish i love u and i'm supportive of trans people but unless you've been diagnosed with gender dysphoria ur not trans it's just facts,NOT
why does it seem there aren't enough females in ceo positions etc let me explain simply in the work place if you want to get to the highest position possible you have to make sacrifices you cannot have everything your way it's impossible you have to begin to work extremely long hours to get to the top which means you sacrifice your free time family time etc males are more willing to do this than females in general males don't have it all so why do feminists think they can males have to sacrifice their family time and free time etc because they may be travelling around the world a lot as part of their job women are natural caregivers and most females in general want to start a family because they have a limited of time to have babies women typically want more balance in their life they don't want to be juggling a high profile job family life and other responsibilities think about it that's alot of work for one person especially considering how much work you need to put in if you have to raise a family it isn't easy for females because they're natural caregivers and they typically tend to be more involved with family anyway for example looking after the children taking them to school etc feeding them etc hence why women take on more part time roles and hence why the gender wage gap statistics are misleading if you work part time you earn less than a full time worker fact women were actually happier in the 950's because they didn't have the responsibilities of having to work high profile jobs look after the home look after the kids like more women may be experiencing today furthermore another reason that explains why there aren't more women in high profile positions is because of competitiveness and personality females are competing not only with females but males too males are naturally and evolutionary more competitive due to their natural dominant traits) so having to compete with other females and other males isn't exactly easy females typically have an agreeable personality unlike males in general) what this means is females are less likely to disagree with something and be vocal about it in general) if females want to succeed in these types of environments and get promoted/earn more money they must take on these male traits competitiveness and dominance women must sacrifice a portion of their femininity in order to gain equality of outcome just like men would have to sacrifice their masculinity otherwise known as toxic masculinity to feminist sjws in order to create equality of outcome desired by feminists) feminists don't understand that having both a mother and father in a high profile job that requires lots of working hours requires time away from their kids who's lives are gonna get affected the kids they are missing out on family time and it's going to affect how they are raised because their parents may be too busy working to give them attention and the care thus potentially resulting in the children to grow up unnaturally independent and not unattached to their parents distant) to conclude i'm generalising here so don't comment saying i can manage because you're a minority which i acknowledge hence why i said in general.,ABU

well women are better at multitasking and taking care of children resulting in lower paying jobs like taking care of their own children or being a teacher or a waitress and men are generally stronger and can focus on one thing better resulting in better jobs like engineering these are just natural born instincts and so if a women has a job that men can kind of do better the quality of work might be less than a man's quality of work resulting in being paid less i don't know this for a fact but i think that is a possibility right?,ABU

you should try to purchase a vegetarian/vegan cookbook there are really good ones out there and make sure you don't only eat fruit because then you'll get sick of it so fast and always be hungry you can still eat all your favorite foods just the veggie version black bean or beet burgers are amazing gardein chicken products like their orange chicken or teriyaki chicken are incredible you can even eat like taco bell just order beans instead of beef it's way easier than most people think for protein just focus on things like mushrooms chickpeas beans tofu vegetables etc.,NOT

so every straight men is trying to be as straight as possible uhm how about non gay males not acting so straight,NOT
hmm.. it's blantantly ignorant to say that there is no pay gap i mean it's clear that the average woman does make less than the average man but it's not anyone's fault but the women who are making the choices that are holding them back from economic success there's many variables and traits that exist within this  cents to the dollar thing the largest ones but not the only ones being mother hood the fact that women choose lower paying jobs and competitiveness so while i agree with the statistics that feminists just need to stop bitching because nothing can be done to put more money in their wallets because it's already illegal to pay people more or less based on discriminations such as race or sex but the message that the gap isn't real is just going against facts they're not really anyone's fault but they are facts women make less than men fact of life quit having children and work more maybe you'll make the same amount.,ABU

next women's boxing.,NOT
this is explained by the fact that all the higher paying jobs demand more time working when women are still expected to take care for children it is because the hour aren't flexible enough that there is a gender pay gap corporates don't choose women even if they work at lower wages because they are not viewed as workers but rather as women who have to be available to their children at home tasks are still managed almost entierely by women even when both parents have full time jobs the gender pay gap therefore exists you should be ashamed to post such ignorant content.,NOT

such crap aauw never published such a study there is a pay gap dont be stupid.,NOT
"don't call it a gender wage gap to mislead people just call it different life choices earnings gap"".",NOT
i'm confused doesn't this help prove that there is a gender wage gap precisely because men are in the high paying fields such as engineering and computer science while women are in more low paying fields such as education and social work yes it is each individuals choice to be in those fields but only because our society encourages them to go into those fields and still sets women up as the carers and teachers while setting men up as the brainiacs and scientists or athletes most of us don't do this on purpose but we all do it indirectly by supporting gender traditions like barbie vs hot wheels or the wife taking the last name of the husband and we have gender traditions for the worforce too for example picture an airline pilot and a flight attendant i always picture the pilot to be male and the flight attendant to be female same for me goes with chef/server doctor/nurse manager/receptionist i always thought this is what was meant by the gender wage gap which this video proved to be true not that companies are so sexist they literally pay men more than women to say that so many women choose these caretaker jobs over men and that so many men choose these intellectual jobs over women is all based on each individuals choice seems to be ignoring our gender defining culture right now we are still a fairly sexist society wouldn't that affect everything especially the workforce?,NOT

i can say there is hello im liliyanna im transgender and im a welder when i was male i was payed 25.5 hr as a woman i was offed 1 hr max this is the same job.,NOT
so basically the wage gap which is really an earnings gap exists because of the careers men and women pursue and the number of hours worked i don't see where this is a problem if women decide to work as many hours and pursue the exact same careers as men do they'd be earning the same if this was a true wage gap which insinuates that for equal work men and women get paid unequally all businesses would hire women over men cutting their employment costs.,NOT

"i understand that a lot of the gap can be ascribed to choices made by both men and women but i think it is important to consider societal attitudes which discourage women from aspiring to careers in high-paying jobs and especially stem fields and push them toward softer"" more traditionally feminine career paths.",NOT
"talking about the gender wage gap is besides the point because even the concept equal pay for equal work"" built into law violates legal rights that are owed to a person and constitutes a due process violation namely if i due to my personal preferences want to give more of my own money to a man than to a woman that is my personal choice it's my money and i have the right to do what i want with it if i prefer working with men more then with women and thus pay a man more than a woman for equal work no one has the right to intervene and tell me how to manage my own money it is my money but the government does it forces me to pay them equally it forces me to give my own money to someone although i entered no legally-binding relationship with that person but is all based on the ideological concept of equality' given the fact that lawmaker's ideological concept be it equality or whatever cannot trump legal rights that are owed to a person basing the laws on the concept equal pay for equal work is a due process violation.",NOT

2k feminiazis disliked this video,ABU
what about modelling industry feminists female models earnings dwarf their male counterparts earnings well feminists ignore the truth conveniently.,NOT
i agree there is no real discrimination but i think that family contributes to this gap women are the primary caretakers of children therefore they take more time off work and men as the breadwinners often have to find a second job to support their families i believe there needs to be done to minimize that gap since too many men are experiencing too much stress and too many women are earning less which means also less savings and a smaller pension for them in the future.,NOT
"well produced and fact orientated video.. which means there is too much logic for the people using the argument on the fist place i'm guessing you lose them about min and half into the video why bother thinking about the arguments presented in this video when you can simplify it to different outcome??? unfair!!!!""",NOT

love you girl! 🥰🥰🥰🥰,NOT
its funny to think about that when people aren't killing each other in war they occupy their minds with this sort of thing like the wage gap isn't that big of a deal at all i'll explain why i said that later) the only reason this is going on is that in the modern world we lack the stimuli from tragedic events we as a species are used to so we have to come up with our own and i'm not saying that women aren't discriminated at all but so many people misses to understand the fact that things have never been better its naive to say that the patriarchy is behind all of this when in fact in the last decades we have been moving so much forward in this field it isn't as simple as to just move forward from the way of thinking that men are superior because in the past that was true due to physical attributes that were necessary i.e hunting and warfare the way of life we have now is so small portion of the human history that its almost idiotic to say that women have it bad so my point is that it is important to drive equality forward but please understand that it isn't an overnight thing but hey what do i know i'm a straight white male from a country that was one of the first to give women right to vote and has already had a female president.,NOT

after seeing some comments regarding the maternity leave i have something to say if you care enough to read things changed so much in the last  years many developed countries have not only maternity leave but paternity leave as well so usually the woman is the first who takes that leave to recover from labor/operation and to breastfeed if they have milk but more and more women choose not to breastfeed or they simply don't have milk children's health doesn't suffer much from this factor actually) then it's the dad who takes a leave and women usually leave enough milk at home so that dad could take care of the child there is no reason why he can't if you think about it for example in finland you see as many dads as moms walking in the park with their newborns for that reason so there is no reason for that gap you people are referring to btw statistics tells us that in the past couple of decades more and more dads take a sick leave to take care of a sick child in europe it's not only on women anymore spouses are finally a team with equally shared responsibilities after all very few families might afford for one of the parents to stay home to take care of children/home because of today's economics so this gap even if it exists should disappear completely in the near future there is no guarantee for a business if they hire a man he isn't the one who will take care of children when they get sick and not to hire a childless woman only because in the future she might have children is not practical at all after all men are physically stronger but women's health and endurance is better and they live longer in almost all of the countries easy statistics to look up) they fall sick rarer and take more care of their health and if they are valuable to the business there is no reason not to hire them if they are more suitable to the position and there is absolutely no justified motivation to pay them less even if they take one or two maternity leaves during their career men will take as many months to take care of their health when they fall sick or their children will and it is beautiful if you ask me children have both parents equally present there is no better thing for them i hope these facts are enough for you to realize why there is completely no base at the decision why to pay women less for the same work there is no way for companies to predict the future of the employee no matter the gender.,NOT

maybe we should be thinking instead about why men and women choose those college majors there's a reason many women don't choose stem fields as a woman who majored in math i can tell you that it is not easy being one of the very few females in all of my classes luckily i had a very strong support system from my family and friends or else i'm not sure i would have made it its easy to see that the problem isn't the jobs its the reason for picking the job and college major in the first place.,NOT
men are wired to be vicious aggressive protective that is how humans survive thousands of years ago with those sabertooth tigers lurking just outside your backyard apply those alpha male traits in the business and you get those male dominated ceos in business the big boss cannot wink fold and be weak otherwise the competitors and even business partners will eat him/her alive testosterone makes a big difference as well.,NOT
men make more money because men care more about making money this isn't rocket science anyone that can't see this must be willfully ignorant men are not more materialistic but they absolutely care more about how much money they make and guess what that's fair the person that cares more and tries harder as a result should do better i know we love this idea of the mary sue characters like ray from star wars.. no practice no effort just instantly a master of whatever she tries to do that's not real life unfortunately the person that tries the hardest usually wins men care more about making money so they try harder to make money because they try harder guess what every decision that they make will be influenced by the desire to make more money and in the end they will likely out earn women stop trying to prove that women are better than men it's crazy annoying and it belies your inferiority complex.,NOT

yes the wage gap exists but not because of injustice or discrimination people in free capitalist societies are free to do whatever they want women and men make different choices in life and so they earn different medium wages since this is not an issue why do we need to address it why do we need to close the wage gap when this is the result of individual freedom?,NOT

i commented once before and it's going to sound like i'm saying this hostile and i'm not at all but you telling her how this works how a transgender should be where you have stated in a past video you still have your penis and what have you down there because you would mourn the loss so does that mean you're not fully transgender you still want to hold on to some male parts because you would mourn the loss so obviously you don't know exactly how it works either i don't either but apparently it's still open for debate what transgender is and what it isn't and how many genders there are so again not with any animus at all here but who gives you the right to say she's not doing it right and you're doing it right not a hater just wondering why you feel you're an expert at it because you have a lot of followers would love to hear a true answer and not somebody cussing me out you want to be accepted like everyone else and be a normal person i got it but here you're squashing someone else who obviously is got issues and isn't dealing with it well but at least trying to express it i don't think you should be jumping down on a lost soul what gives you the right to say what the fuck that's not how it works ,NOT

you're talking about personality traits not being transgender.,NOT
thank you for not jumping to the conclusion that it is discrimination or oppression like sjws.the wage gap in specific careers really boils down to flexibility in hours.and women focusing on children is often the result of interplay between couples or lack of couples) a lot of mothers would rather be the primary caregiver rather than the father it does not mean that the men are lazy how dare those dads not raise kids more or the mothers are lazy how dare those moms focus on the easy task of raising kids of instead of non-child care chores and work) its just their preferences.,NOT

wage gaps if they are real make sense the government expects married women to have a male with a job alongside them to add up to the total salary needed for the family and even if the male doesn't have a job it is a proven statistic men do better than women this means performance determines how much you earn for work not your gender.,ABU

modern feminism is so odd...,NOT
trisha your body is just fine you don't need to look like her your perfect the way you are,NOT
i have many female friends who chose to get into different fields and made the same money as men the problem is they fall in love and want to have kids they get emotionally attached as a mother and take breaks which forces them to either stay in current position or take a break from their current job while the men who still shoulder most of the expenses continue to compete for higher wages which makes it appear men make more then women on average the simple truth is it is life choice decisions that affect income on the opposite end of the spectrum i have seen female coworkers who are extremely career oriented and they make higher income in higher positions then other men because they don't care about having kids or have a male partner who works in a lower paying position and is the house husband it all comes down to choices but feminists and gender inequality advocates don't want to hear that also evidence shows that men on average don't live as long as women so go figure.,NOT

women before us have fought for our rights to compete in sports fairly and this is what happens if there is no difference than there is no need for segregated sex teams biology doesn't care about feelings hormones don't mean anything when you've gone through puberty and have all the benefits of a male physic have transgender women sports because the fact is trans women are not the same as women it's honestly sad to see girls and women being pushed out of our own spaces.,ABU

as a trans guy myself i think there's a huge difference than being trans and not really feeling like a woman i personally can't speak on your feelings but j think you need to do you reserch so many people who think they're trans but aren't because of other issues that they believe could be fixed my being different gender for instance you being attracted to gay men doesn't mean your a gay guy you just happened to be attracted to some of the qualities they have i think that it's awesome to try out new pronouns and to experiment but i don't believe in just going straight in and coming out as a trans guys i think one thing for me that really makes me confused about this is the fact that you've gotten multiple breast jobs to enhance your boobs as a trans guy that would absolutely kill me you can obviously do whatever you want and i hope you well in your transition but i think you need to do way more reserch and figure out if you want to become a man not just a drag queen.,NOT
"the wage gap is just the average earnings of men to women not even taking into account the job,education or hours worked",NOT
but its obviously not as explicit as one singular employer having one man and woman whom he pays an unequal amount its not that clear cut and you'd be naive and frankly ignorant to believe so it's a systemic issue we devalue women's jobs and have created an atmosphere where women are discourage from taking careers in fields such stem or medicine typically the higher paying jobs alternatively the explanation for the gap in positions would be that women simply aren't smart enough to earn the top positions.,NOT

i think she is confusing bisexuality with being transgender,NOT
you video is very informative and truthful however i think you are missing the point its not about attempting to understand what is really going on they are not interested in that its about having a complaint regardless of whether it is legit) backing it with some carefully crafted statistics and/or research and repeating the complaint over and over and over until they get what they want which is never enough so they repeat the above because it works enough times and so they feel empowered and self righteous it is a mental disorder really.,NOT
so you're bored with who you are so now you're gonna just be like okay i wanna be trans that's fun this isn't a fucking game people suffer and struggle every day trying to just be who they are you need to double fucking check your education if you want attention on you be a good person and stop being so damn dramatic.,NOT

how did you get that download option next to the subscribe button??,NOT
you aren't talking to actual feminists about the attempts to close the wage gap clearly high level efforts to closing the gap aren't simply demanding women get paid more they are more frequently trying to solve the issues that cause the gap to occur those differences that you think need to be accounted for are the very things feminists are trying to address don't control for the issues that cause the gap fix those issues there is also an opportunity gap for many jobs not simply differences based on as you put it choices that it's dishonest to ignore.,NOT

yassss i commented on her video saying i hope you drag her,NOT
okay so this video seems so far to make it sound like being a feminist is a bad thing i am a feminist in the way that i think people should be equal no matter what there gender and that yes there maybe some wrong info but doesn't mean there isn't a difference between the way men and women are treated i may be a bit confused so if you would like to explain to me how i am wrong or whatever in the comments nicely feel welcome to do so,NOT
it's like gold plated vs gold just because something is dressed up in gold doesn't mean it's gold through and through they should be ashamed of themselves,ABU
before you comment that the wage gap doesn't exist i strongly recommend sticking around with the video i think you'll find that there's consolodation from both sides and gives note to an often untalked about fact that fathers are not encouraged to care for their children as much as mothers.,NOT

1 it's illegal to pay a woman less than a man for the exact same job and vice versa  a lot of the difference in pay between men and women overall can be attributed to personal choice in careers  there are underlying biological and evolutionary factors at play when it comes to which careers men and women choose  none of this is bad.,NOT

what people miss about the gender wage gap is that there isn't any this gender gap myth doesn't take into effect hours worked type of job full time part time also the fact that women don't particular do the same jobs as men and if they do they don't work as long as men do women like nurturing and office roles that are best suited for them you know jobs that are not particularly dangerous no women out there are gonna break their back doing a real man job like construction just ask any sensible women and if they say they do they're lying simple as that,NOT

we also miss why there is sbout 0 reasons,NOT
the problem is that in the current american culture we keep wage/salary a secret somehow thinking that it's shameful or private or something and putting a huge taboo on revealing what we are paid to our coworkers when i worked a job that gave me access to payroll data i was shocked how much salaries varied between people doing exactly the same job who had identical experience and tenure when there are many jobs like that then the statistics become hard to extract the gender wage gap from the overall inexplicable wage disparities if every company published how much it paid each employee then we could figure out the breadth and depth of the gap.,NOT

"talking about the gender wage gap is besides the point because even the concept equal pay for equal work"" built into law violates legal rights that are owed to a person and constitutes a due process violation namely if i due to my personal preferences want to give more of my own money to a man than to a woman that is my personal choice it's my money and i have the right to do what i want with it if i prefer working with men more then with women and thus pay a man more than a woman for equal work no one has the right to intervene and tell me how to manage my own money it is my money but the government does it forces me to pay them equally it forces me to give my own money to someone although i entered no legally-binding relationship with that person but is all based on the ideological concept of equality' given the fact that lawmaker's ideological concept be it equality or whatever cannot trump legal rights that are owed to a person basing the laws on the concept equal pay for equal work is a due process violation.",NOT

some great vegan sources of protein are beans/lentils/legumes especially in combination with grains like rice or buckwheat tofu is a good protein source seitan or wheat meat is also great if you have time/interest you can make it at home very cheap and easy but you can also get it at most health food stores eat a wide variety of fruit and vegetables most of which for the record also have protein in them i wouldn't worry too much about protein in general most americans actually eat close to twice the recommended amount in a day it's pretty easy to get enough definitely do some research on getting the nutrients you need because at first it can be difficult but once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy if you're having cravings there are some good substitutes for meat and dairy products that you can get and vegan desserts are definitely a thing  there are so many great vegan recipes/recipe blogs online you can find recipes for everything from super healthy raw food to vegan triple chocolate cake some of my personal favorites are chickpea salad sandwiches stir fry and fajitas and don't feel bad about getting stuff in packages you don't have to o everything all at once start with what's easier for you.),NOT

the main thing people miss about the pay gap is that it doesn't really exist there are laws preventing discriminatory pay what the  cents to the dollar myth comes from is a broad brush evaluation of what all men earn vs what all women earn apples to oranges when you actually factor in things like hours worked education and experience and the same career the wage gap disappears.,NOT

hum.. i agree that these numbers are controversial however it shows that the place and the occupation of men and women are still different in our societies if you want to achieve global equality and liberty any job should not be labelled as a man or a women job why women should be less interested in engineering and why men should be less interested in social organization why do women do more part-time job why are they more women than men staying home taking care of the children ,NOT
yay i am so proud of you this is fantastic newsi it may be difficult at first but you are stronger than you think honey i believe in you you just have to retrain your brain and way of thinking every time you put your fork to your mouth i highly recommend you subscribe to the vegan mojo he offers alot of amazing helpful tips that will help you transition over to veganism you don't have to just eat fruits or lettuce he makes food that you would normally buy at a fast food joint but made completely from vegan ingredients you don't have to give up your love for chicken tenders burgers pizza tacos whatever you love to eat there is a vegan option out there just do your research but i wouldn't recommend following what freelee preaches honestly her diet is only sustainable if you are an athlete who exercise alot you will give up if going vegan if you stick to just what she eats you want to take baby steps and ease your way into this lifestyle because you do want to be in it for life if you aren't eating the things you love and enjoy you're going to want to give up i know you want to do this for aesthetics but the bigger picture is to do it for the animals you know how those videos made you feel well it is the cruel reality of what happens every single day in the meat and dairy industry again.. yea meat tastes f*cking awesome so for someone who has been eating it their entire life would find a vegan lifestyle impossible to stick with because they think they can only eat fruit and salads etc.. but it is not true at all just do your best and don't beat yourself up if you fail just start again fresh the next day baby steps ease your way into this lifestyle...because once you see how amazing your body is going to feel you will be hooked don't forget to drink plenty of water too best of luck sweetie i am rooting for you d,NOT

"did you count college drop outs,high school drop outs,the difference in job fields when it comes to pay and ect.if you did then you would know that the pay gap isn't caused by sexism but the decisions people make in college and highschool example one kid has a major in art the other has a major in chemical engineering which would pay more people would say chem engineer but what if the artist was incredibly talented and had good advertising skills than that artist would pay more no matter the gender so if the chem engineer was male and the artist female would you say i'm wrong plus what if said artist decided to do commissions by companies and also bid paintings online so now do you think that the female artist is no richer than some one like steve jobs so through those decision's the artist is rich while the engineer is the average male but what's the difference the only difference is the one is talented while the other has no talent nor exceptional education in the field so the only one that's to blame is himself for not picking the most suitable job i'm thirteen and even i can tell some of what you said was bs! ^∆^)",NOT
imagine vox thinking it has an opinion,NOT
plus it should not be called wage gap but earnings gap or something.,NOT

does anyone know what happened to freelee's instagram?,NOT
well guys here's the next shane series,NOT
isnt wage paid according to the service you give? men are paid more in some jobs because they provide more service and customer satisfaction in these jobs so they have to earn more i think that makes sense it also explains why female models are paid more than male models the answer is simple the female models have a higher service satisfaction ratio than their male counterparts so why all the fuss? i wonder?,NOT
vlog brothers made a better video on this topic covering the area in a broader sense.,NOT
share this video,NOT
cut out fats fat gives me huge breakouts!,NOT
unfortunate but true,NOT
notice how she didn't bring up women having children or wanting a home life once not once solid points.,NOT

what the fuck also why does she look like this now??,ABU
i will download this video if possible.,NOT
i just googled fair oak farm and i cried what kind of monsters do such cruel things to the baby animals sooo cruel!!!!!,NOT
too many bullies commenting she isn't trans but she obviously doesn't know what being transgender is she just sounds confused either that or she's a troll just trying to get famous using controversy.. but that would require a level of processing she really doesn't display here so it's kind of hard to say hard to wrap my head around someone her age being this oblivious about gender and gender identity.💁🏽,NOT
also vegetables i know that sounds obvious but popeye had the right idea.,NOT
to be honest idk how you see her content as good she pretty much gives youtubers a bad name is she capable of telling the truth?,NOT

man i feel bad for her she going though something onbvi i mean not dysphoria but something.,NOT
should be named idiots of 019!!,ABU
what they really mean is women should be paid the same as a man for the same job title not the same work. i have noticed in my life i have had the same job title as women but i was required to lift more any produce more then then women in my job just cause you think you are working harder then someone else doesn't mean you are if someone takes  min to do a job and i take min todo the same job i will spend min pissing around so does that mean the person that took twice as long to do the job working twice as hard nope this idea that woman work as hard as men or harder is bs sorry that woman have to put in more energy to do the same work as men but you are not working harder.,NOT
the video states that the wage gap shrinks to . cents once you factor out the different choices men and women make but she then proceeds to claim that the remaining gap of . cents is caused by the choices that had just been factored out of the calculations.,NOT
literally almost all the trans youtubers i watch posted vids about her lmao trish is so fing dumb,ABU
i'm excited so i'll be waiting for live broadcast 01 🌎💖🌱🇵🇪,NOT
how long will this last is the question regardless good luck trish,NOT
this is michael an barack obama's doing,NOT
why would you want to close the wage gap if you don't know the conditions that produce it that's like wanting to close the wage gap between ceos and their gardeners making people more similar for similarity's sake is just pointless.,NOT
some good ideas would be potato fries(no oil) pasta bean tacos(lots of protein).,NOT
i've watched trisha since 01 and i do not think she's trolling because she has said these same things before she made a video in 01 called gays i wanna bang and she says it sucks to be in a woman's body but do i think she's trans no.........i think she's uncomfortable by societal standards..........not by her own body sis wants to be mom and have children for goodness sake.,NOT
i look forward to pbn's vegan recaps every year vegan for years ️🌍,NOT

yea i'm only  and a male and i plan to be the ceo of my own tourist trap in japan my sister fashionz,NOT
i wish they would title these documentaries differently because so many people won't even take a look if it has the word vegan in it.,NOT
this shit is just crazy people have just lost their fucking minds they are boys with a weave and bad eyeshadow if you were born a man guess what...your a fucking man,ABU
most men lack the orderliness and patience needed for child care so women are often relegated voluntarily or involuntarily for domestic work it is sad thing that male humans are evolutionary weak in parenting when some birds fish and amphibians show good male nest-keeping and parenting.,NOT
usually i'm not the type to gatekeep but honestly knowing trisha this is the biggest insult to the trans community if this is a joke it's offensive she either wants attention or is confused is she really trying to convince us she has gender dysphoria ???,NOT
well i'll tell my jobs i work for private security where i'll work as a bouncer for up to 2 an hour security escort for all kinds of stuff up to 2 an hour and to transfer prisoners riding in a van for hours with murders rapists and drug dealers inches away up to 3 an hour now how many women are gonna do these jobs where i've been beaten stabbed and shot multiple times because i've yet to see any,NOT
hi trish i haven't been vegan long its been about half a year but so far what has helped me is eating at least one really great starchy or carb filled meal a day like pasta vegan pizza or potatoes something like that it makes you feel so great and energized and won't send you into like a funk eat a variety beans different colors of veg and fruit so you get all the nutrients you need and that's how you actually feel great don't feel pressured to need to fit a vegan structure like raw or hclf in the beginning it is easiest to just start by eating vegan foods that you like just so you don't feel as restricted in the beginning especially for these weeks la is so great for vegan foods i live in china and it is way harder here p good luck!,NOT
doesnt exist in the uk we have minimum or living wage everyone is paid due to abilities and hours they work meaning more skill more pay per hour so if you want to fix the wage gap then work more men take jobs that are heavy hard working women take softer jobs like table services and retail,NOT

this was a pretty good video tbh i'm still skeptic on both sides but this was well presented though i wish your sources were there also it does seem dodgy that there's still a .6 gap obviously most of this can probably be explained but i worry for the poor souls who're paid less purely for things like age/gender/race etc.,NOT

excellent video but it's already to late to change planetary degradation the need to dismantle industrial civilization reduce human population simultaneously and remove the domineering cultures from the lands they have invaded is what's need but as i stated it's to late industrial civilization has already effed up the dominant cultures have proven themselves incapable of governing other peoples lands or country's they have failed the world,NOT

gotta love it how vox uses ww showreels to exemplify the amount of women used in hard labor jobs when men were less available because they were drafted to fight wars.,NOT
you need greens lots of fruit and baby kale cuz it's not so strong try jugo juice the mighty kale smoothie so good so sweet and eat more than you usually do so u don't binge.,NOT
this video wasn't terrible you actually acknowledge that women gone into more less paying jobs than men and that they are more likely to stay at home with their kids instead of staying overtime at work i honestly expected this video to be garbage but it was actually decent.,NOT
proud of trisha although i know she's probably not gonna stick with it,NOT
still the questions remains why do women make those different choices? a lot of those choices in college major number of hours worked etc. are influenced by the fact that women are still expected to be homemakers even if both parents work full-time countless studies show that when a mother and father both work mom does the majority of the housework and child-rearing this could partly be due to biology where women are more inclined to nurture their children giving you the benefit of the doubt but it is undoubtedly largely thanks to societal pressure and cultural norms.,NOT
yay conrats ! its great ),NOT
long story short women consistently choose jobs that pay less then blame women for it they are also more likely to take time off less likely to work overtime more likely to leave for pregnancy less likely to act for a raise and less likely to ask for a promotion there are studies on all of this but it doesnt fit the feminist narrative so it's ignored.,ABU
oh and in order to lose weight on a vegan diet you can pretty much eat everything you want as long as it's a low fat whole food such as fruits vegetables whole grains and beans eating lots of processed foods oils or high fat plant foods like avocado olives coconuts nuts and seeds will likely make you gain weight but in moderation those are fine.,NOT

it's always good when a woman debunks this crap cuz its more likely to be heeded.,NOT
my friend tried to debate me on this she believes all this stuff about the wage gap but when i tried to explain to her that the statistics don't account for different jobs she said no women get paid less for working the same job” i asked her what specific jobs she meant then and she said the jobs they do studies on” that drove me nuts you can't just read a study and not even look at where they got the information like seriously what do people think happen that women just get handed a  cent check at subway after their shift and men get handed a dollar you can't pay people differently just based on their gender anyways i should show her this video.,NOT

scrolling through the comments to find the one positive comment that somehow excuses the 3k likes,NOT
i dare you to title your next video i'm coming out ,NOT
she probably should have really thought this through before posting this video for the world to see being a part of the lgbtq community i don't think she tried to offend the community but this isnt a well thought out decision personally i feel she should explore herself more and acclimate herself to the proper terminology.,NOT
quinoa is delicious cooked for  mins with apples cinnamon honey and of course water.,NOT
"""but if i pretend there is a gender wage gap for same work done changes might be made that mean i get paid more or work may get easier so why not promote this debunked myth if it's rejected i lose nothing but if it's accepted there's a possibility of easier work and/or greater reward i'm not being played on for my credulity i'm being smart by pulling a slot machine for free nothing to lose everything to gain!""",NOT
for all the hate people give social libertarians they have made liberal sjw's back way off on the stridency of their discrimination claim regarding the wage gap now instead of a patriarchal conspiracy we just get a video complaining that women get to play with the kids more and have a more balanced lifestyle for a tiny bit less money progress towards the truth is slow but it appears to be real.,NOT
i think all men use hormon bloques and compete against women..done sarcasm ...,NOT

hey joe get jamie to google vegan dog food bahahahaha.,NOT

i love this conservative channel if the jewish american business society had a youtube channel this would be it point one of sexism getting a woman to speak about the wage gap because she is a women good job i think you fundamentally failed at your there is no wage gap if conservative statistics put it at . cents that is still a wage gap and much less than the actual figures.,NOT

eat nuts gurl! almonds cashews walnuts macadamia nuts etc nuts are great protein and have amazing skin benefits also eat dates great for a raw food to add to any meal.,NOT
the information shown in this video doesn't account for how women are more unlikely to not work over time more likely are to take time off work and how women are more likely to follow their time scheduled for work while men are more likely to be their when the company needs them calls them in companies pay more for employees who are able to do this) women also own the majority in in four of the five lowest paying majors women are also less likely to take jobs involving risk and are less competitive in the work force the video is correct in how most statistics that show a pay gap don't show the factors yet neither does theirs there are more factors involved then what the video has told you and what i have stated the video does not give a full synopsis on the wage gap.,NOT

''it's not sexism it's common sense' can someone put this quote on a t-shirt?,NOT
lmao the amount of people being misinformed by this video is amazing.. why do you think men are available on-call to their job more than women?? because it's not their job to go feed the kids help them do their homework and tuck them into bed.. those are called agentic traits women are expected to have communal traits there are so many theories that debunk this video its actually ironic an old lady who is like  years old is voicing this video its as antiquated as all the dinosaurs who comment supporting it.,NOT
so based upon the bull shit wording by the state a boy can simply walk up and say he identifies as a girl and that's that proof me wrong,NOT
can you please provide sources thanks!,NOT
this is awesome and all but since when do femenist and leftist care about facts?,NOT

i understand you're an edgy troll but this video is really hurtful i've been subscribed for years but after this i cant continue to support you you're misinterpreting what it means to be transgender and using it as a way to get attention.,NOT
how are there so many dislikes when the comment section seems to be in agreement,NOT
maybe check out genderfluid,NOT
oh gosh i'm so happy to see this happening congrats trish so happy for this big step you're taking some tips to get you started...don't starve yourself eat until you're full no point in over-eating you can always eat later when you get hungry again buy tons of potatoes rice pasta starches to keep you full fruit to give you energy basically that's it whenever you want something more consistent go for the starches if you want energy and a light belly go for the fruit but do never ever starve yourself also googling vegan recipes is a great way to see yummy stuff to eat check out vegan corner for easy amazing recipes aaand if you don't wanna cook i'm sure there's tons of vegan places there just ask them to not cook stuff with oil that's pretty much it hope it helps i'm so happy for you and proud good job girl you can always come to us vegans for advice we'll guide you through this journey and of course freelee as well d xx,NOT
you all do realise this is recorded a while ago.,NOT
i'm starting to think you are just free advertising for chik-fil-a,NOT
what makes this even better is the chick fillet,NOT
sooooo what you are saying is that men are more flexible with regards to their working hours and that when a job demands flexibility people who are flexible are rewarded men are flexible for work women want flexibility from work how could that gap ever be closed ultimately should it even be?,NOT
stupid women who cant even do simple math bark about wage gap that is non-existent ,NOT
that's is random but i hate the new youtube comment section,NOT
yay trish if you're trying to lose weight try to avoid sugar salt fat and oils in your foods  of course the natural sugar that is found in plant foods is fine! good luck!,NOT
the problem isn't animal agriculture its overpopulation our earth doesn't have enough resources to sustain billion people and counting cutting out animal products from your life and replacing them with mass amounts of plant foods wont prevent the planet from destruction it actually causes more harm than good do proper research i was vegan for almost years and happily went back to eating animal products veganism is an agenda filled with lies and bullshit glamorizing processed fake trash over the food that kept our ancestors alive you exist because your predecessors ate animals and yall are saying you escaped the matrix ha its just the beginning my friend,ABU
ngl shame on you for neglecting her opinion you can't just trash and decline how she does feel inside whether it makes since to many or not.. her trying to come out to the world isn't easy people should stay in their own lane including you because you can't understand how she's feeling i understand you most likely have different feelings that led you to your transition but honestly back off be understanding for her your video should seriously be taken down.,NOT
okay you need to stop because there are actually people who watch you that are transgender nonbinary and genderfluid! you should educate yourself by getting friends that have gone throught the bs that family members that don't accept them! people lose their lives every day because of this educate before talking about this crap!,NOT
weak willed women and sjw's created this problem get yourselves out of it you want to coddle your kids deal with it there's a reason genders and specific rules of the body were created to be maintained.,ABU

trish has many many personalities and maybe one of her personalities actually is a gay dude why cant she vent her feelings like you others want to do..people always want to be gatekeepers on sexual feelings. exhausting. agree or disagree..and move on..live your own sexual life. no one has to accept you or agree with you but we should all tolerate each others choices it has no meaning to my life so why do we care what she feels or wants.,NOT

do i have a brain 000 am i trisha paytas 000%,NOT
i think what most are missing from this video is that the wage gap is inherently caused by culture and the disproportionate effect children have on women vs men the wage gap problem is an apples to oranges issue because its caused by forces primarily outside of the workplace but we see its effects as the average wages between men and women what vox is trying to say is that to fix this inequality we should approach it by giving women more opportunities to balance this extra demand placed on them or some how alleviate it through policy whether its better childcare maternity and paternity leave to allow the father more time to help or more flexible work hours its not about trying to pay women more to compensate but by giving them the tools to be on an equal footing which i think we can all agree with.,NOT
how does your mind make up all this crap?,NOT
if freelee replies ill go vegan.,NOT
make sure you workout though over eating even a on a vegan diet will make u gain weight happened to me because i listened to freelee,NOT
"2:5 i consistently get the oh my god i didn't know you were straight"" it hurts especially when my first interaction with them is normally flirty maybe if i follow trishas logic i'm a transgender stripper",NOT
i almost fell out of my chair when i saw this title i've subscribed to trisha for so long i have to see it to believe this but proud of you i will even go on this journey with you ,NOT
even if you mess up don't let the vegan nazis get onto you every vegan meal or snack is a step in the right direction i would eat lots of carbs try to use no oil or if you do use any or vegan butter use very little best brand is earth balance but just try and eat simple like a bowl of pasta with sauce and some veggies or rice and veggies or you could home make sushi with jasmine rice and avacado or cucumber and it's so fucking good just keep it light and simple and if ur starving then eat some go to quick snacks i get all the time are dr mcdougalls ramens they are very low in fat and super delicious and healthy but yes girl such an awesome decision good luck! 💕,NOT
trishaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa your fucking influence could change so many lives  eat the melon alone for reasons i don't remember it's better to eat melon by itself  vegan restaurants in la are caaaaaarrrazzzy as i am sure you know don't restrict yourself  look up vegan recipes on pinterest cookie&kate is my fave blog omg i'm so excited to hear this i really hope it goes well i hope freelee gives you lots of advice.,NOT
if anything she could have said she is nonbinary but ok,NOT
now i know why people say i shouldn't look at the comments.,NOT
“this is vodka by the way. bruh that sent me-,NOT
it's not like my dad has had a really hard time finding a job since he stopped teaching and my mom works her ass off to support us my mom works an :3 to :3 job common in nb and she doesn't take as many vacations as a lot of other women plus she misses a lot of events me and my brother are involved in because of work which used to often take her across the province for a week or two) does she get payed as much as a man who works the same hours holds the same position and takes as many vacations yes she does.,NOT
i know of only one wage gap wa ge,NOT
another thing is men are more likely to ask for raises or promotions than women so even if the man and the woman are doing the exact same work with the exact same hours and are both deserving of a raise a smart employer isn't going to just hand it out unless they ask for a wage or risk losing a valued employee,NOT
there are only two questions relevant here  do women get paid less for doing the same job title with the same job requirements as men no the don't because that is illegal  do women have the same opportunity to move into higher paying jobs and demand the same pay as men via negotiations yes they do once these are considered any difference is purely down to the choices made by men and women and if women want to have kids they must accept that they are going to suffer in terms of pay but if they want kids clearly kids are more important than a career so who are you to judge?,NOT
human beings don't accept change easily..... sadly in this video it shows one group battling against the other group..... just like republicans and democrats people will eat meat until the end of time i guarantee it and you'll never change their minds even though they have to take a handful of pills daily as a result of their views lets all live peacefully as one and each have our own ways of eating.,NOT
mommytang is the best wonderful recipes!,NOT
yes trish proud of you x,NOT
for proteins stock up on nuts beans green veggies also for new vegans they have fake meats that taste very real that have protein make the transition easier if you have any cravings to make it fun i would look up fun recipes on youtube or pinterest frozen fruits are really great for snacks and smoothies plus you don't have to worry about them going bad.,NOT
yesssss this is ironicccc,NOT
there is no wage gap there is however an earnings gap as people who do the same job with the same credentials tend to get paid the same amount because regardless of the business owner they want to maximize profits and thus pay their employees as little as possible while still retaining more skilled individuals however if billy works  hour weeks and mandy works  hour weeks one will make more initially and be more likely to receive promotions in the future which results in better wages and thus even greater earnings down the line this is the jist of what many purposefully mislabel as the wage gap as a wage is the rate one is paid hourly not what you earn over a specific amount of time including non-work hours that is what we call earnings.,NOT
yeah.. you can't really blame her the lgbtqaip community really messed up the concept of transexual people also i identify as a gay man because i love britney spears,NOT
here before it gets deleted,NOT
“muscles glistening in the wind uh what ,NOT
hahaha feminists can shut up now or should i say radical feminists.,NOT
the man talks like a religion promoter lol,NOT
claims to be a man wears rainbow sparkle stiletto nails.,NOT
pharmacy is a more female oriented profession and the hospital i work at for example all managerial positions within the pharmacy department is filled with women not only that but even the higher positions in the pharmacy are still female dominated.,NOT
i would like to point out that those individual choices are affected by sexism and gender roles women are dissuaded from going into manly careers where they earn more because they'd be the only women in that workplace and people tell them its not a woman's job yes its technically individual choice but its a highly railroaded choice.,NOT
it is an unfair advantage for abc to pass criticism of this obvious physical advantage off as transphobia is pathetic.,NOT
"when ur vegan u have to eat a lot more because fruit and veggies and carbs and stuff because it's a lot less caloric dense plus chia seeds and flax seeds help so fucking much also smoothies in the morning with super greens and fruit and chia seeds and flax seeds are super easy ways to get nutrients nutritional yeast also helps get nutrients and it also gives a great cheesy flavor also watch a bunch of what i eat in a day videos""!! im so happy to see one of my fav you tubers go vegan keep educating urself! keep learning and growing you'll feel great plus it helps ur mental health at least it helped mine",NOT
the logical conclusion of the wake movement everyone must identify as trans or be outed as transphobic.,NOT
im here for the comments,NOT
half the commenters just saw wage gap in the title got triggered then disliked at least watch the video.,NOT
you can do it trish  don't worry if you fail just don't give up and keep trying and problem solving until you get it lots of people will be happy to help.,NOT
fries grilled portabella mushroom tastes weirdly like steak when seasoned with mccormick montreal steak seasoning which is also vegan) fried rice without the egg vegetable/tofu eggrolls superfoods veggie burger veggie grill smoothies dates so good when blended and eaten with apple slices like a dipping sauce) veggie grill fake chicken sandwiches almond/coconut/soymilk vanilla lattes depending on preference) coconut or soy milk caramel but with no caramel drizzle)/strawberries&creme/vanilla bean/mocha frappuchinos from starbucks with no whipped cream zucchini pasta a bunch of different kinds of pasta and sauces salads tofu tacos with avacado hummus and veggies lots of types of dark chocolate krinkle cute sea salt and cracked pepper kettle chips grilled veggies sweet potato fries... the list goes on! if you're craving something there surely is a vegan substitute out there good luck and with much love and positivity sent your way im rooting for you along with a bunch of your vegan fishie gang!!,NOT
she has also came out as a chicken nugget,NOT
the wage gap is so old and obviously debunked i'm an extreme leftist and i know this.,NOT
i'm sad cuz it's only been days since she posted this video and i see today on snapchat she's eating chicken and waffles  wth trish (,NOT
so the case is that the entire concept of a gender wage-gap was established from a misinterpretation of a statistic regaring average salary of men and women and some people came to the conclusion that this difference in average salary must be because of discrimination when it's really because of differences between how males and females think/choose men on average tend to go for the higher-paying jobs and work longer very interesting.,NOT
any veggies that are dark colours and nuts are super high in protein,NOT
watch thriving on plants on youtube for day to day vegan recipe inspiration,NOT
that chick is so totally ridiculous and she does make a mockery out of trans people.. ,NOT
that's a pre filmd vid,NOT
this is not america sad only  of country are all about this unnatural sinful lifestyle they will just be sinners in hell one day hell dont care about gender.,NOT
i thought men and women are the same aha,NOT
you forgot the variable that some women permanently or temporarily leave the workforce when having children big omission!,NOT
the ones that were born girls should be allowed to dope.,NOT
women simply work less,NOT
women are typically higher in agreeableness and being agreeable doesn't normally work well in business,NOT
omg relax those fucking hands,NOT
how can there be a gender wage gap if there is 70 genders?,NOT
what you're listing as reasons to why you're trans.. those are more like transphobia fetishization and misogyny...,NOT
where i work women tend to want to work less hours and call in more often then men they also complain more about work and usually the manager has to cater to the woman more when it comes to the task at hand it's just a number game though i can't say that there isn't women that are more capable then me but when it comes to labor it's hands down a man's industry,ABU
the goal is educate both plant meat eaters to try to start buying food that improves earth's ecosystem on the meat side buy sustainable regenerative grass fed finished ruminant animals wild caught fish cage free pasture raised chicken eggs vs factory farmed on the vegetable side buy organic bio dynamic poly permaculture vs monsanto monoculture doing those will make humans animals plants soil environment healthier happier nature didn't get it wrong human greed got it wrong but we can change it buy sharing good info.,NOT
if this happened in combat sports it wouldn't even be debatable.,NOT
"if they have an unfair advantage if??????!!!!!!????? what about the aspirations and lost scholarship opportunities of the girls whom have no hope of winning against them???????? what's next? i'll tell you what trans m to f people being able to take on women and girls in boxing and martial arts when that happens what is going to be the literal point of having don't hit girls slogans in schools?""",NOT
this was a very well explained video,NOT
for the slaughterhouse videos.. somewhere in asia they beat dogs then eat the meat there's something sacred about eating dog meat when the dog was tortured alive any torture is depressing...,NOT
so she relates to gay men drag queens,NOT
lmao last night on her snapchat she was eating chicken and waffles,NOT
hormones are steroids ,NOT
she is garbage.,NOT
right right i forgot i chose to be payed less.. doesn't it seem kinda coincidental that the jobs dominated by women are the ones that get payed less??,NOT
why do they earn less because they dont do as good a job,ABU
thaaaaaaaank yoooooouuuuuuu for making this video,NOT
it's literally factually incorrect.,NOT
the answer is not to put more women in those male-dominated positions as chs pointed out that it comes down to personal preference but to either put more money into those female-dominated positions like social work or find a way to make those more profitable no easy task).,NOT
"""i identify as schizophrenic""",NOT
my mom told me two different people one a man and one a woman were in the same job one after the other they had the exact same work and the same hours but not the same salary also works consider less good the moment women work in them i don't live in usa but here it works this way.,NOT
so basically there is a average pay gap because women mostly choose lower paying jobs on average than men,NOT
she's not trans being masculine doesn't make you a man if she had dysphoria i don't believe she would have gotten her boobs done so many times she even has a thing on her patreon where people can pay to help her get more plastic surgery she's just doing this for attention because she craves it.,NOT
i wear makeup about once a month lol,NOT
please freelee go check his account he's using animal for his filthy art /3,NOT
because they are men duh,ABU
go buy more bananas,NOT
talk about synchronicity i decided 02 to go vegan right at the end of 019 it's not a choice it's a requirement i've been quasi vegetarian for years eating usually plant based meals but still enjoying meat and fish occasionally and dairy as a staple but just before new year i saw among other ghastly footage of cruelty and indignity a vision-bite of a small animal being tortured and killed for the the food predilections of the chinese and that image has stayed excruciatingly present in my mind it seemed to me that the animal was asking me as i looked straight into her bewildered dying eyes in a moment of direct contact through the camera lens to be kind to be aware to aid and support the life of the world not eat it the goddess looked at me through those eyes eyes that were saying goodbye i cannot unsee or un-hear her message so i'm taking up that request.,ABU
omg trisha has really lost touch with reality wtf is going on here i would love to know what shane thinks as one of his/her best friends i'm so curious thank you blaire for not being an over sensitive trans woman and see things as they are and ain't afraid to tell the truth i really love your videos and to hear your opinion thank you ️❤️❤️,NOT

all students should be shown this in schools especially in colleges.,NOT
this video was filmed over a month ago shes wearing the same dress makeup that she wore to the internet famous premiere cause it's the same day she is definitely not still vegan she's eaten eggs chicken and bacon on her snapchat since the video was filmed.,NOT
if women don't have kids they will be free from the wage gap especially since they can sue companies for the difference the problem begins when feminism opens the barriers to motherhood and the workforce many women consider it normal to work and have kids yet end up with the burden they may get help from their spouse parents or a caretaker but feel the need to bond with their child even if they are entirely free from their chores etc many women end up being stay at home mothers feminism says there's nothing wrong with it and that it should be a paid job the many ways feminism turn women into womb when they can simply be child free.,NOT
you women cried for year's saying we are equal to men we are just as strong as a man and can do everything a man can do if not better why you think women are allowed to fight on the frontline in the army and now that you got what you all wanted your starting to realise that you women are weaker than us men ,NOT

trisha we're so proud of you the fact that you are giving the vegan diet a chance is a huge step hopefully you will become full vegan bit even if you don't we understand its just so crazy and wonderful to hear this!,NOT

this video is a joke on her snapchat story yesterday she was eating bacon eggs and sour cream onion chips that are not vegan sooo i would say this is completely fake and what she said about being vegetarian is false too since she was eating bacon lol,NOT
i swear that watching this entire praegeru series on youtube has given me a superior and more practical education than years of college did factor in the subtle indoctrination i no doubt received obtaining a liberal arts degree and all i needed to unlearn in the real world i'd say these little videos are invaluable.,NOT
not bad not bad at all good video,NOT
this is so wrong on so many levels why are the parents not talking about how the transgender did actually try to race the on the boys track team and didn't do well and that is why they went to the girls track team.,NOT
"""it isn't sexism it's just common sense ",NOT
beyond meat products are awesome the feisty crumbles are great in tacos!! you would never know that you are not eating meat.,NOT

when you do anything to get views,NOT
really guys she said she was a chicken nugget a few years ago,NOT

320 feminist dont like de video (,NOT
after two weeks i recommend just taking out red meats then when you are accustom to that take out birds chicken and turkey) then after that cut out fish followed by other animal by products i'm only a vegetarian so i can't help with animal by-products but take it slow because cutting it all out at once is extremely difficult not saying you can't and not saying people don't i just couldn't personally do it best of luck to you girl i'm so proud of you and the influence you're giving off!,NOT
6:0 don't forget a chicken nugget too,NOT

thank god jason got out of this relationship,NOT
i think youtube is up to something.. i searched up gender pay gap myth and the top results were liberal videos with just over mil views when normally this video should come up because it had more views i liked this video but when i came back it said that i hadn't liked it google and youtube tries to censor out the right and promote their own left ideologies typical...,NOT
i mostly agree with this video although i think there are some things one still has to consider as you mentioned there still is a wage gap between men and women for the same work which you explained as being the cause of men being more willing to do long hours but why is that biological differences between men and women aren't that big so that they would allow us to say that the reason is biological no it's the way how men and women are raised differently in our society that's also the reason why most women work in lower paid jobs as you mentioned at the beginning because we raise them to work in these jobs that's the core of the whole gender wage gap discussion.,NOT
trish protein is not the important thing,NOT
no one trish im attracted to gay men so i must be transgender,NOT
once this bitch and a lot of others get off this platform it'll be so much better,NOT
just try don't sneakily go eat some ham or dairy without your fans knowing it because the begging part of it all is the work things because of all the withdrawals but eventually you will realise how much better you feel,NOT
it's a total and utter myth you would have to be extremely gullible and know next to nothing about stats to fall for it....,NOT
it makes me sooo happy to see normal thinking people in the comments please keep these corrupt people out of government and vote trump 020🙂😇,NOT
"this is really offensive in the worse way this is not humor"" please seek help and think about what you're doing /",NOT
just because you don't like girly things doesnt mean youre trans just because you didn't like grown men staring at your boobs doest mean youre trans just because you don't like a role of women and want to be the man and the assertive one doesnt mean youre trans it's okay to not conform to gender roles and still identify as your birthsex it really seem like everyone be forgetting that.,NOT
such unfair bullshit!! if the wmen do not do a massive protest against this the women will get what they deserve!!!,ABU

goes vegan for views,NOT
just bc trisha is masculine with her assertiveness doesn't mean she's a man women shouldn't think that bc they do something considered manly means that they are a guy vice versa no guys should think they are a woman bc of something feminine these stereotypes were put into place just recently in the grand scheme bc guys used to wear dresses its just fashion and surface stuff i had a bestfriend who was trans and believe me i know the confusion of a trans in the first years of transitioning and for her to make a mockery out of it bc she thinks gay guys are hot.. lol i find a ton of gay guys hot am i trans no,NOT

as a hindu when we were growing up we were never meat focused we were food focused beef was not on the menu so whether its here or not makes no difference to us we fast where its just vegetables times a week) our meat eating is reduced to the days and its mixed between lamb poultry and fish and that too its always mixed with vegetables what is known as hinduism knows that meat is not really important eat what you enjoy and eat it in moderation but with alot of awareness so you get the satisfaction and proper nutrition this vegan versus carnivores are just too extreme in my opinion we believe in balance of life management of your mind and body this extreminism is dangerous to our world vegans are becoming aggressive and as a result not rallying their cause very well who wants to be an angry vegan neither do i want to be an angry carnivore balance in mind and body.,NOT
im weak as shit lmao,NOT
wait trisha is 1 wtf,NOT

"as far as starbucks you can sub anything with coconut or soy milk there's gotta be great vegan restaurants in la that's the easiest way to introduce yourself into the diet there's a lot of normal food also. it doesn't have to be labeled vegan"" technically oreos are vegan there's substitutes for everything just remember being vegan doesn't mean gnawing on kale and almonds and don't beat yourself up or give up all together just because you slip once or twice it's a big change and you can't expect everyone to transition into it easily every time you choose a cruelty free option you're helping the longer you go the easier and more rewarding it will feel also from experience try not to bring it up in convo to new people.",NOT
i was hired to a position previously occupied by a male about my same age when i was cleaning out the filing cabinets i came across a pay stub he had left was i surprised and angry to see his salary was 0k more than i was offered and i was more qualified to boot i had no children so that wasn't an issue and was known for working long hours often long after everyone else in the office had gone home it was blatant taking advantage i left after months when i realized there would be no moving past the glass ceiling or changing the male dominated management mentality men need to realize that women can do work as well or better than a man and get over their baseless fears of possibly inadequacy.,NOT

i think it's a troll i never take her seriously.,NOT
i would have spent another minute and explaine that having these choices is a good thing for women an alternative that requires government intrusion to remedy perceived discrepancies would force women to work longer house perform more dangerous jobs etc that they may not want in the end this seems a non-issue time to move on unless you're fund raising) nice video!,NOT
this video makes the assumption that women being stay at home mum's is going to continue to be the norm and that work hours should work around them how about we change this norm which inherently chooses to oppresses women maybe that should be a message of the video continued increase in women not staying at home to take care of kids and less kids all together.,NOT
these comments are disgusting,NOT

why you don't eat a balanced diet meat-vegetables,NOT

it's interesting how even after taking everything into consideration there is still a gap and this gap is shown to be something for women to be grateful for like yeah it's only a 0 gap so yall feminists better sit yo ass down why is there any gap why is everyone rejoicing saying that they've got the feminists there shouldn't be a gap.,NOT
my only complaint about this video is that the average is not the median it's the mean someone please explain to me why all these videos and articles use median instead of mean when they are referring to the average the mean average the median is the middle number it separates the top half of a group from the bottom half why would you use the median in this case why wouldn't you use the mean average) surely some statistician could explain this.,NOT
trisha...i love your videos....but slow down for the love of pete sometimes i can't understand what you're saying!!!! lol...but what helps a ton is watching what i eat in a day for vegans there's so much more than fruit to eat in your diet best of luck and record it please we would love to watch!,NOT

"her eyes look a billion times regular size instead of a illigal alien she's a legal alien haha ps she's right and said smart things a good question comes iup from this study why do women work less and are inflexible they have children or dont want to work at night caus it's scary.,.,",NOT

i don't think gigi knows that there's such thing as schizophrenia and delusions.,NOT
this isn't sexism it's just common sense. my new favorie quote.,NOT
i think that woman got less and still in many places get less wages cause there is a certain mindset that women don't have as much as the caliber as a man also woman come with a load of baggage as in child care which is alone too much for a business to handle that is why women are not chosen for jobs everytime it is practical for men to be chosen for businesses but this neglects woman who want to work the system is filled with holes maybe the problem is not present in your region but nothing in the world is regional we can find many cases of wage gap in many places i don't believe i'm a toxic feminist or anything so if you want to argue let us do it politely😊,NOT
it seems like a cultural shift that's just going to iron out after a while that's alright.,NOT

they r boys weather they like it or not this is unfair,ABU
freelee's you can eat as much as u want isnt 00 accurate...maybe it is if you run a 0k everyday amd do alot of excersise but the foods u can really eat as much as u want of are like carrot sticks minus hummus or like apples or oranges or grapes because those will fill u up fast bc they have a lot of water so u wont really have to eat that much to be full like the whole eating a ton of rice or a whole box of pasta or  pounds of potatos or  mangos is not really healthy unless off course u do a ton of high intensity excersise...,NOT
this is awesome!!! i hate having to say this but.......... please go and talk about this girl sorsha on youtube she is a vegan but she is a bitch.,ABU

freelee i truly used to dislike you and your message because of how harsh it can sometimes seem but the more i watch the more i like you and the more i want to become vegan like you say you don't have to like me but you have to hear me and i have could you possibly make a video about converting to veganism while you're still living with your parents my parents think veganism isn't healthy because they aren't informed and when i explain why it's actually good for you they get frustrated with me and don't let me really go through with it is there any advice you could give thank you!,NOT
this lady is crazy,NOT
she is definitely trolling again.,NOT
why not have an estrogen vs testosterone level test for these competitors before they're allowed to compete it's no different than when pro athletes are doping i.e mark mcguire lance armstrong etc. to gain a competitive edge over the competition have these transgender athletes submit to a test and once their estrogen vs testosterone levels are at a baseline consistent with the rest of the girls let em have at it.,ABU
they maybe women now but they aren't females since they lack the basics that nature gives the female body,NOT
she keeps switching from median salary to average salary which i'm guessing is to the benefit of her argument.,NOT
sooo the wage gap is only a thing because women generally work less.. why was this even an issue then?,NOT
aaaaaaaaaaaaah this is vodka btw effin dead,NOT

i'm sorry but this video is misleading it does however kind of show how even with years of data and statistics you can manipulate the truth.,NOT
scientists run experiments round the clock,NOT
so if we want the wage gap to go away we need to encourage our daughters to go into higher paying fields i can do that ),NOT
i'm so proud of you trisha! i hope you keep this up your body is a beautiful temple and it deserves to have the best care💗💗,NOT
these are not females it doesn't matter what anyone says lipstick on a pig is just that they should not be allowed on females sports teams.,ABU
so excited that you're gonna try being vegan!! it's an amazing lifestyle !,NOT
vegan for years best decision in my life.,NOT
i have a question if you're vegan shouldn't everything be organic? pesticides kill insects most produce is covered in pesticides,NOT
the best part about this is a female is narrating this this channel is my hero,NOT
just saying because u probs dont know but mcdonalds fries arent vegan! and make sure to eat lots of leafy greens for protein you can get omega from flax seeds and you should supplement b1 because you cant really get that anywhere on a vegan diet the best breakfast would be lots of fruits or a smoothie watch bonny rebbeca raw alignment or fully raw kristina to get the hang of things and see how to eat proprely,NOT
haha this is brilliant ,NOT
it makes me sick god please stop this,ABU
wrong in so many ways.,ABU

i decided to go vegan just over a month ago and for the most part am doing ok with it i still struggle with work lunches but am adding to my recipes all the time i'm doing this for the animals the environment and my health been diabetic for  years) i started with just one recipe homemade falafel with veganaise i then replaced my usual bacon and egg breakfast burrito with overnight oats it's amazing my sugar used to go through the roof just eating oatmeal with skim milk and sugar now i can have oatmeal with bananas blueberries sugar cashew milk and chia seeds my sugar actually decreases a bit it's a freaking miracle i only just tried the date and banana smoothie a week ago it was only two bananas and dates but i couldn't finish it this girl who is 2 lbs and could eat large donairs couldn't finish a smoothie despite the razzing from family and a husband who refuses to believe that eating meat is bad for you or the environment i'm sticking with it i'm not the healthiest vegan yet but i'm sure that will come side note also decided to start studying buddhism why not,NOT
it is never too late i was vegetarian for 8yrs then i watched dairy is scary and that pushed me over the line and became vegan over yrs ago not only is it good for you and the planet it feels so good knowing no animal has suffered because of what you eat or wear and at the age of 4yrs old i feel great and happy i am doing my small bit saving animals and the environment.,NOT
i want to go vegan or a little bit but im not sure how to tell my parents becuase they think the vegan diet is unhealthy and i would need to substitute meats for other things to give me protein?,NOT
transgender males should not be allowed in girls sports i don't see transgender girls competing in male sports,ABU
i've read the comments on her video the video she recorded is like a month old she's already eating animals again /,NOT
don't majority females get along better with males cause less bitching also don't we always dress down at home and then dress up to go out this is so strange,NOT

people reacted the same way when gigi came out as a lesbian fuck the haters be you.,NOT
wow is abc really gonna side with these disgusting perverts?,ABU
this really opened my eyes thanks for sharing this information,NOT
i agree with this video but the hiring only women argument is a bad one as that itself would be called discrimination and would not be allowed in extreme circumstances under u.s law.,NOT
to share truths bringing to light one of the darkest corners of humanity allows people to make decisions based on facts ritual animal abuse in the service of our taste buds and our refusal to acknowledge the verities of the industry is an atrocity akin to those who are caring out the act of processing animals for human consumption a vegan for two and a half years i am proud and privileged to be a part of the compassionate mindful vegan community this documentary helped me feel validated in my pursuit to make a difference for my health for my children for the planet and…for the animals.,NOT
it's completely stupid to say this is unfair,NOT
glad you covered this you're one of my faves on youtube bad ass bitch,ABU
transgender denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex tomboy is a girl who exhibits characteristics or behaviors considered typical of a boy including wearing masculine clothing and engaging in games and activities that are physical in nature and are considered in many cultures to be unfeminine or the domain of boys,NOT
i'm pretty sure that she made the video with her shirt tucked lopsided.,NOT
she is a chicken nugget,NOT
hi freelee i have a question about a problem that i have and i was hoping you could either make a video about this or just give a thorough response i'm only  and i live in a household where everybody eats animal based products i've been wanting to become vegan for a while now but i know that my family will not change their diet along with me i don't have a job since i am currently focusing on school extra curriculars and volunteer work specifically with animals and i'm sure i'm not the only one in this situation what do you suggest i do thank you for inspiring me to want to change my diet.,NOT
good lord please don't premote freelee worst person ever.,ABU
made me remember when i struggled with my own gender identity in the past i thought that i might've been a gay guy in a female body turns out i'm just very boyish and never really fit with the female must be girly stereotype. ,NOT
no gender gape,NOT
maybe it's just in my head but people just become so much more beautiful when they speak up for animals!!,NOT
that is not transgender that is genderfluid or nonbinary you are being a transtrender by saying you are trans and still comfortable identifying as your born gender!,NOT
i think.. i think i just got second hand dysphoria.. is that even possible right now. djjaskdnisneid ,NOT
does she not understand the difference between being ftm and being a tomboy-,NOT

stress makes me break out like crazy i went vegetarian minus the main dairy product like milk cheese eggs etc and i still breakout when i stress out before exams don't rely on veganism to cure all of your problems and don't expect to see results straight away you're not going to see results in weeks i would say after two months of me being veggie by body actually got use to it and i went from  stone to and a half i actually gained a lot of weight in the first month due to the changes in my diet by body wasn't use to.,NOT
i'm just waiting for the day a transgender person plays girls basketball and start dunking on people lol,NOT
the last line of holding a chic fil a cup and saying this is vodka by the way was so iconic,NOT
"i don't get what she means when she first says that when you account for different choices women and men make the wage gap shinks to , c and than she says that this gap that does exist is again due to differnt choices that doesn't really make sence does it?",NOT
trisha when she needs to pay rent,NOT
women and men are different both have different duties to each their own men go to work whereas women stay at home and take care of the children stay single or have no child if you want the same wage as men i'd be the richest just by hiring low-wage middle age women for my business,NOT
subscribed our point of views are exactly the same this video needed to be made.,NOT
is the plant based app still running mines not working and hasn't for ages?any ideas?,NOT
freelee react too sorsha!,NOT
if you notice that the highest paying college majors include different fields of engineering an area that is highly devoid of female talent.,NOT
oh i thought this was an ad before the actual video,NOT
"""we need to be aware of this if we're gonna close the wage gap the only way you're gonna close the 7 gap that feminist keep harping on about is to either force women into higher paying jobs they don't want or force men into lower paying jobs they don't want.",NOT
hang on i thought the feminists were saying for decades that men and women were the same these trans athletes are just outworking the other girls.,NOT
just go easy on the potatoes pasta rice and bread it's so easy to overeat these things just stay beautiful girl you're gunna feel great.,NOT
so glad i made the decision to go vegan the beginning of this year i've learned alot and now i have my husband going vegan as well.,NOT
this is so awesome but i just have a feeling it will only be the two-ish weeks she has tons of fur leather and animal tested products and in no way do i see that no longer being in her future being that she loves designer and such but i do love the idea and hope that she continues to further her vegan lifestyle to prove me wrong :,NOT
nobody on the left claims women are paid less than men for the same job except in third world countries and rare instances where equal pay legislation doesn't apply) so congratulations on the strawman.,NOT
subscribe to freelee!!!!!,NOT
women also have to compete against transmen as well apparently i'd be fascinated to see how a transman in a 00m sprint/mma fight against a transwoman would do.,NOT
u should watch mommy tang!!,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap that it doesn't exist.,NOT
impaulsive made it ,NOT
"can you believe there are actually hard working people out there that actually contribute something to society just like my mom who was a single mother raising me and my autistic brother who is very low functioning while working hard my whole entire life) that get such a shitty paychecks and basically no recognition for the hard work they put in but girls like trisha paytas are millionaires being idolize and people wanna be just like her but all she's doing is making such idiotic and crazy video's basically being a moron on the internet for a living it's just fucked up and not right people like her are the reasons why the youth is so fucked up these days most kids have no clue what it means to respect themselves and respect others and we all know she actually doesn't identify as being trans she's just doing this coming out video for money/views that's basically the narrative of all her video's and that some how makes her a queen"" please this world is so shit..",ABU

great video it's about time someone shut down this obviously false myth.,NOT
great if there is such a wage gape why aren't businesses firing men and hiring more women they would save a fortune,NOT
men are also more likely to ask for a raise.,NOT
you can eat bread pasta pizza also cake!!!,NOT
trisha dressed and acted more feminine than 0 of the people i know irl regardless of gender or what they identify as maybe trisha is trolling or maybe trisha is more gender fluid than they realize?,NOT
i totally agree with you on the trisha topic but i guess it's okay for sam smith to come out as nonbinary i believe in nonbinary being a thing i don't believe in genderfluid astrogender or anything crazy like that but when a person is trans and can't identify with being either male or female i believe it's okay for them if it fits them to call themselves okay english is not my foreign language is themselves with v correct? nonbinary if that's what makes you feel euphoric and eases your dysphoria hell yes go for it and with sam smith i just hope we have a positive example of a nonbinary person i just hope for some other representations than those crazy astrogender transtrender).,NOT
blaire you are g l o w i n g in this video,NOT
see filmed this a month ago,NOT
thank you mam for clarification because nobody would be believe if man explain it,NOT
for some added fun see how thomas sowell dealt with this issue waaaay back in 98 on firing line it goes back a loooong way.,NOT
"""men are more likely to work longer hours without advance notice what i'm not a man lol",NOT
some of the proclaimed pay-gab is said to be because the mommy penalty' a woman that choose to get a kid will drop in income because of that but here is the thing you women don't need to get kids right no one is forcing you and you can live the life as a man if you please men can not get children by them-self so i would say that men are worse off in men will never reproduce in their life but its only in for women.,NOT
hilarious well women wanted this so live with it took over there washrooms jobs and now there sports.,ABU
i haven't done enough research to form an opinion on the wage gap but the condescending tone of this video really doesn't help its credibility.,NOT
trisha was eating meat on her snapchat story not even  hours ago,NOT
only came to dislike,NOT
who else watched kevin garrahs video on this?,NOT
i saw eden was supporting trisha too,NOT
rahsaan yearwood is disgusting...how do you let your son become your daughter...smh..,ABU
ok but why does it have to be a gay man why can't you be with a bi or pan people tf?,NOT
i think her ex and his friends made her so ashamed of being a woman and made her so ashamed of who she is that she has become so confused about who she is without them i think she genuinely thinks she's in the right mentally but she is not getting good guidance and she needs therapy i don't think she knows you have to have dysphoria to be trans maybe she's gender fluid maybe she's just ashamed of who she is either way her friends really need to help her right now.,NOT
she had chicken on her snapchat story today lol,NOT
nuts are a great source of protein!,NOT
the only thing good about transgenders is not having to buy plan b.,ABU
i've been vegan since i was 2 nearly years ago,NOT
she needs to learn more about the lgbtq community and stop faking shit.,NOT
if women want to close the wage gap become educated in more valuable vocations work as many hours as the highest earning men and don't have children just like how men have no guarantee to have children it's solved now do it and stop complaining.,NOT
i love you blaire i'm so glad i found your channel you always crack me up🖤,NOT
i know trish is just starting to be vegan but she should be careful with makeup because a lot do test on animals..,NOT
do they make these videos for children or morons which is there target demographic,NOT
justice at last,NOT
how proud are u that she already devoured a pizza on her snapchat from domino's?,NOT
i think she's actually a male to female the voice is very telling actually.,NOT
there is no gender wage gap,NOT
this video is what we needed it proves that there is no gap in salary for men and women working for the same time we may not have attained equality in all aspects of life and society but it dosen't mean that we don't need to pick our fights i think that is part of the reason modern feminists are seen as radical and such however i don't know about the situation outside of the states and canada so i cannot be sure about it.,NOT
let them consume themselves,NOT
yes there is it is simple math,NOT
some of the comments are harsh this is a big step for trish let her take her time give her encouragement don't discourage her don't hate her for eating pizza comment a good dupe tofutti pizza is 🏻),NOT

"yay i'm glad you decided to become vegan or at least give it a try i've been a vegan since may the hardest thing to give up for me was cheese and eggs since i am a huge breakfast person the vegan eggs are really gross however aside from that i've found tasty vegan versions of everything else there are drastic differences in taste between brands as well it can sometimes be a hurdle trying to find the artisian good brands as i'm from the same metropolitan area you are originally from rock-bottom god i hate this city so much ugh! lol anyway off topic it shouldn't be hard to find the good brands in ca i saw that youtuber vegan gains made a video response for you i think you should check it out he offers a lot of insight that i think would be helpful for you the best butter alternative brand i have found is called miyoko"" the best cheese brand would probally be chao melted) or kite hill boca burger spicy chikin pattys are pretty good hope this helps a little trish take care .",NOT
what are the marks on her forehead maybe she just bumped her head a little too hard.,NOT
every time i hear about gender wage gap all i could think about is what jim jefferies said lol,NOT

i am confused ,NOT
congratulations d  going to give love and advice to trisha now d 3,NOT
damn a video that isn't completely biased good job.,NOT
the video was pre-recorded she was eating fried chicken on her snapchat a few days ago,NOT
she came out as black bish anyone who has eyes knows that,NOT
definitely try gardein's meatless fish nuggets and meatless chicken nuggets i was able to eat vegan for a week because of those products ),NOT
trisha you don't transition to satisfy other people ,NOT
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱you're so beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination.,NOT
if animals didnt want to be eaten then why are they full of food?,NOT
tbh if trish can go vegan i can do it god dammit now i don't even have an excuse not to.,NOT
wtf this is a hits blunts moment.,NOT
she also forgot this thing called the equal pay act from the 0's.,NOT
thank you for this report please learn how to talk without vocal fry and upspeak.,NOT
envy is what god doesnt want!,NOT
"definitely eat more substantial foods besides fruit to keep you full for longer and give you more protein and fiber like beans lentils,whole grains(quinoa brown rice oatmeal sprouted whole grain bread and also veggies! you need veggies to be more satisfied because of the high vitamins and minerals found in them definitley gave your greens if they are hard for you to eat throw them in a fruit smoothie spinach is great in smoothies because you can't taste it at all try to like saut or steam veggies like broccoli green beans asparagus honestly any veggies you like once you start eating the little by little your taste buds will adapt and you will eventually start really like vegetables also hummus is really good to dip veggies in  i hope this helps and i hope to see you sustain this lifestyle and incorporate more fruits and veggies in your everyday life love you trish",NOT
my biggest tip for losing weight on a vegan diet is to avoid processed foods obviously) just cause its vegan doesnt mean its healthy haha although vegan junk food is definitely better for you than non vegan junk food just stick to fruit veg wholegrains nuts seeds and legumes if you wanna lose weight fast limit your fats ),NOT
"1,00 triggered feminists",NOT

galina schatalova research her works,NOT
billions more people billions more animals for food fact.,NOT
did trisha suffer from a stroke in the last few years or something???,NOT
youre going vegan but dont eat vegetables lol what are you gonna eat rice and beans everyday?,NOT
i don't like how people are mean she is obviously a bit confused she or he is having a gender crisis she has my support.,NOT
there are genuinely trans men out there that wish they had male parts trisha not being one of them getting a strap on and calling it a day isnt going to cut it for them /,NOT
try mangos just try a bunch of stuff vegetable stir fry everything go to the vegan restaurants around la,NOT
i'm currently trying to be vegan for a few months now and i've been really successful lately but i also have celiac's disease too so when i'm on vacation it's really hard for me to find vegan and gluten free food (,NOT
really annoying that she abuses the struggle people go through for clicks.,NOT
so excited for trisha and i really hope the vegan community can be behind her and help her through her journey thanks so much freelee for helping her and showing her the slaughter videos you really do change people's life's keep it up girl ,NOT
milli vanilli been training look out,ABU
this video provoked me so much the wege gap is 00 about sexism women-dominated professions are lower paid than male-dominating professions even in a scenario where both jobs requires a university degree and the same dedication and hours spent at work the thing about that men are willing to work more hours relocate etc depends only by the fact that they are not expected by society to take equal responsibility for children and household work women for example have far more parental days and are expected to stay at home when the child is sick for example of course this will ultimately bring the woman less money this is not a choice it is a patriarchal structure.,NOT
whatever happened to the video of you and trisha talking about the situation,NOT
women make less because they decide to make less more then men.,NOT
correction earnings gap.,NOT
i think this video is well put for what it is i would like sources to back up the data in your video i also think that some of the reason the men care for their kids more is because it isn't possible for them most company's offer paid leave to women but none to men iirc thanks for reading thoughts?,NOT
vlog your day and what you eat,NOT
women make 7 to a mans 1 but the mans only left with 30,NOT
this video basically debunked the wage gap while also still claiming that there is a wage gap what,NOT

so we're the fuck are the feminist women r getting fucked by men out here and they won't say shit,ABU
if it were a male explaining this it would have a lot more dislikes,NOT
there is a gender wage gap but there is no gender earnings gap everyone gets the same for the same work you've mixed up your terms.,NOT
if you doing it to lose weight for weeks then maybe you will have better results from the atkins diet for quick weight loss but i think been vegan for two weeks then why not commit to it 0 percent your title says you going vegan but you said only for weeks why not commit and become fully vegan if you going down that route i tried it out for months few years ago was nice but yeah i eat meat still no hate thanks why weeks only become vegan for life ),NOT
trisha going vegan is like freelees life's mission lol it's awesome.,NOT
thank you for this she needs some mental help.,NOT
five hours websites government websites job workplace statistics motivational wage seminars and learning about economics vox has proven they can't even get basic journalism right to prove a theory to be correct you have to research it to be false and harshly this is the scientific method id like this to be correct however if your numbers experiment yields unfair able results guess what it isn't real it's a earnings gap and it isn't sexist it's about individual choices and the core belief of equal opportunity not equality of outcome if you stick with a narrative over the evidence you're an ideological individual.,NOT

freelee! you're amazing!,NOT
it's okay if they are in packages proud of you for trying it out:),NOT
veganism is an evil death cult,ABU
i think it has something to do with the fact that women arent pressured as much as men to work men are waaaayyy more pressured to have money in their pockets so it makes sense they would go for the jobs that pay more sex is also a motivator for men to have money there's still a whole slew of women in the world who aspire to be housewives it doesnt mean women are less ambitious some nurses works 2 hour shifts we just have different levels of whats comfortable.,NOT

don't be afraid to eat too much some people end up gaining or losing a lot of weight when starting out as a vegan so don't expect to loose a bunch of weight in weeks it takes a while to make progress so take it slow and be patient it'll pay off and you'll feel and look great,NOT
i found out about the gender wage gap when i heard bernie sanders harping about how awful the situation had become for women i went to his website to read up on the topic i found only bullet points so i was forced to do my own research to see how such an injustice had continued to occur it took me about  minutes to find out that bernie sanders was a socialist windbag who cared more about votes than doing what was right any politician any politician who tries to use this bs wage gap number to push their agenda should be bound gagged and flogged we're talking about national policy and the highest political offices in our country there is no place for this kind of bs when something so important is at stake.,NOT
what about all the 2-3 woman who have earned more than their male counterpart when variables are identical?,NOT
"check out kalel cullen's chanel,she has a lot of good vegan recipes!!they helped me a ton ️",NOT
i personally wouldn't follow freelee's raw-till-four as much as he's a jackass vegan gains response video has some good advice and like you said kalel's what i ate in a day videos are ace and don't feel like it's all or nothing at the moment!! if you can keep it up for weeks that's great...but a lot of people find the cold turkey way doesn't work for them so maybe try going vegetarian for a few weeks...then cutting out eggs...then switching to non-dairy milk in drinks...etc.,ABU
i agree with this and if it is true then a law requiring men and women to be paid the same for the same qualifications and work should not be a problem.,NOT

you bastards got it all wrong you guys are a bunch of feminists looking for something to go on with your agenda you are retarded and the wage gap has been illegal since 969 you don't take in mind that generally woman work less hours take more days off go to lower paying jobs also men for example have higher times in jail and have a higher suicide rate along with higher deaths at jobs not to mention that a lot of triggered feminists cause men even if the didn't and then ruin there lives in fact woman are probably more privileged then men i could go on for ever to be honest.,ABU
what i learned from this video go to business school,NOT
this channel is the greatest thing i've ever seen,NOT
trish posted on snapchat and instagram that she was eating chicken and waffles.. guess her vegan diet didn't last long...,NOT

eat your healthy fats nuts avocados and don't drench your food in a oil but a little is fine i think healthy fats will keep you satisfied ️,NOT
this shit is not fair this remind me of the jawanna mann movie men are born with more muscles and less fatty tissue its unfair the the real girls who have trained they whole life against the obstacles our body presents on its own i'm so tired of trans women telling real women what a woman is unless you have experienced cramps from a heavy period or had to deal with boobs especially for an athlete bc bigger boobs can be a hindrance in sports you are not a woman you are a trans woman which is a different category i think i feel like i'm a doctor today so why don't i go operate in some ppl might feel like a policeman later on and arrest somebody i'm all for ppl living the best life they want to live but when it starts to affect someone else future that's where i draw the line if one of my children was running with these girls i would bring pickett signs to every meet,ABU

i hope youre serious trish i have a chronic disease a plant based diet was the best thing ive done to help myself but it takes time here are my suggestions i hope you look into them make fruit smoothies instead of drinking coffees bulk frozen fruit is cheap and easy to use full of antioxidants which you def need c frozen strawberries banana c coconut water same formula for anything make  however many you need couple it with fresh bananas with sunflower butter add cacao nibs make an oatmeal bowl with hemp milk and fresh fruit breakfast is what powers your day make it count smoothies and solid whole foods fruit in general bananas especally have been proven to enhance your mood if you feel good and are thinking clearer you will eat well lunch can be large too mexican food is fine lay off the corn and gluten though ive rrad they can cause inflammation in the body which you dont want beans and rice are your friend beans rice gauc lettuce tomatos add hummus and veggies like cucumber carrots celery cauliflower etc eat plenty of snacks nuts are great dates with nut better hummus and veggies salads are great too add quinoa for protein or chickpeas theres a brand called chickpeaots something like that they sort of taste like crutons olive oil pink salt and apple cider vinegar is a classic house dressing keep it simple and dont go hungry this diet is not limiting youll have things youve never had before and feel great too if you wanna keep going after two week look into detoxing everyone if full of toxins and your body needs help getting rod of them,NOT
well the whole gender pay gap is fake it has been debunked so many times!,NOT

i'm mad watching this i'm a trans guy),NOT
was waiting for this,NOT
so great i'm so proud of you my advice start following some vegans on instagram for some inspiration and delicious recipes ,NOT
the only way for transgender athletes to compete in sports is to have some sports that includes both women and men you know like how they have mixed doubles in tennis with one man and one women that's honestly the only way i see it being fair for trans athletes.,ABU
 business depends on the company and the economy if i work for a small business i will be paid less than a corporation there is the equal pay act of 96 or 4 i always get the years mixed up so you can sue women usually work with jobs that are more for emotional reasons and a good chunk of them pay less than jobs like engineering don't forget that part time jobs do pay less i'm just saying look at these things before saying there is a pay gap.,NOT
but check her last video i mean like same trisha i think i wouldn't be able to go vegan either like maybe i would eat healthier and eat less meat but i still would eat meat if you haven't watched her last video she did another mukbang plus since she made that video if you follow her on sc she still eats meat and dairy.,NOT

it's literally impossible for me to go vegan cause girl i need me some popeyes,NOT
she says choices create the difference not the wage gap but aren't choices created by the gap in education in the fact that women are often forced to work in less-paid sectors that women more often take care of children and thus spend less time at work this gap is not a myth!,NOT
nice lady sorry not interested good luck to everybody,NOT
did that woman say theres quorn in the greggs sos rolls or corn?,NOT

maybe you take advantage of your gender choice just like your skin you are acting like its harder for you but the truth is you get nothing but special treatment earning nothing karma will catchup when you get aids tho dont worry,ABU
...............is she.. ok ,NOT
it seems she maybe just jumped in too deep too quickly it only took a few days and she's just posted a video already of her eating multiple non vegan items also there seems to be a disconnect between a vegan diet and a vegan lifestyle i love that she tried or is trying but maybe baby steps would be more efficient and productive for her it's easy to get overwhelmed and give up when you try for too much right out of the gate.,NOT
i'm so proud of you for stepping up and being vegan it's amazing,NOT
omg trish this is amazing make sure you supplement b12: it's from bacteria beans/legumes and grains are great for protein.,NOT
these films are what started my vegan journey and i'm so happy to be watching one for the first time as an official vegan!!,NOT
there is no wage gap women statistically work less than men to care for children or take more vacations because woman also will take more time off than a man will,NOT
women chose to make less money got it!,NOT
veganism is wonderful for your mental health!! i have suffered with depression since i was 3 i was on all sorts of medication different meds at one point then after months of vegan i came off all the meds and the rest is history x,NOT
i tried going vegan was only able to last only one week it's so hard i wasn't dedicated enough ,NOT
2:4 if claudia goldin is such a good researcher how come she thinks that the entirety of jobs performed in society can be reduced to three categories business tech and science seems like she's trying to cherry pick the date to fit her conclusion doesn't it.,NOT
check out hotforfood if you want some less healthy vegan recipes gardein chicken tenders are amazing honestly i don't even notice that they're vegan not the healthiest thing ever but y'know gotta have those cheat meals sometimes as for everyday things i personally always keep rice beans and frozen veggies around for quick and easy meals make sure you aren't letting yourself getting super hungry that's when you'll end up craving and binging on foods that aren't as good for you congrats trish hopefully this will be the start to some great changes for your health.,NOT
small problem with the animation at :20 it shows the wage ratio shrink from  cents/dollar to . cents/dollar which means that the wage gap is even more extreme that we previously thought.,NOT

as long as they compete with men and not women then theres no problem,ABU
it's showing she's able to download the video i feel silly but how??,NOT
that video already seems like another do dogs have brains video,NOT
one more comment female dominated jobs seem to reflect female's natural abilities as a result of having babies unfortunately when a couple i.e. a male and a female decides to have children it is usually the female's job that is sacrificed why because the male's job pays more was it the female's choice alone to have children so why does it always seem the female takes the hit career-wise?,NOT
this does not apply to any minority male,NOT
.. great so it's not that women are victims of sexist paying it's that they're just victims of sexist hiring and educational procedures just wonderful clearly this completely debunks sexism in our society.,NOT
i would suggest watching the documentary forks over knives it's very informative and shows why animal products aren't good for you and it gives you ideas of what you can eat on a vegan diet i've been vegan for four months and i recently when hclf high carb low fat and i would suggest eating whole foods definitely eat lots of carbs like bananas rice potatoes etc and do not calorie restrict a lot of vegan foods are low in calories therefore you can eat a lot more anyways i'm soooo happy for you!,NOT
those are guys doing it for attention they say they want to be different only changed there gender because they were not good in men's sports.,ABU
i guess the wage gap as represented here not caused by active discrimination but work time choices does exist between the sexes i just don't understand why it is always put into the perspective of sexist discrimination i wouldn't deny there to be still some issues with that but just concentrating on this factual wage gap here i do not see why it is seen as such an important cause to close it by force) as presented here it seems that the wage gap is mainly caused by the division of parenting tasks partners choose in which women still often do more of the unpaid work at home and therefore earn less careerwise surely our society will change so i guess work at home will be seperated more equally and i don't think this is a bad trend as it promotes egalitarian principles and so on this however is a cultural issue as this wage gap is mainly based on this choices and not structual discrimination it's comparable with the single mom single dad ratio maybe yes there are essentially more single moms than dads and maybe it would be nicer to have this more equally but it is not due to discrimination of men but rather because of the still existing sex models children stay with their moms so it would be nice to dicuss this topics without always putting things as discriminative.,NOT
fun fact women entering the workplace lowered wages for everybody,NOT
veganism...the suicide cult...hundreds of videos on youtube by ex vegans who nearly died on this starvation chemical filled diet....beware..sponsors of this movie own hundreds of vegan restaurants and are cashing in on billions of dollars while they enjoy meat and dairy and while you take a trip down suicide alley to end up very ill or mentally compromised for the first months or years it's cool as you stop eating junk food which you should have never eaten anyway but after the detox is ended...then the problems will start and the community of desperate vegans will bear down on you to make sure you go down that sad road to hell with them you will become abusive too of every and any one who does not subscribe to your way of misguided eating habits you will be obsessed with food you will eventually end up afraid of everything you touch as food...what is in it what does the packaging say and packages will promise you the moon but very rarely deliver you real food besides you give the cells in your body the tedious work of converting a bean or lentil into human flesh...and these cells will eventually revolt leaving you with cancer and other incurable illness i know as a friend ended up with bone cancer within a year of turning vegan...beware of this suicide cult making money while they lead you to your grave and you end up with very little joy of living and can go nowhere on the planet unless you visit this group's special vegan restaurant which eats up all your cash so you don't even have money for rent!,ABU

gap is opposite women are promoted early to pump corporate management quotas those underqualified women therefore make less than their much older counterparts extending the 7 myth) companies then forced to raise executive women's pay at the expense of males quotas and glass-ceiling myths drive women's pay higher and higher while any look across any management tier shows underpaid and underage women thus perpetuating the gender-gap myth.,NOT

trisha lmfao im going vegan!! for a week lol ok,NOT
the easiest way to think about debunking the wage gap is this way if women really are paid less why don't certain businesses just hire women so they can save more money in employee salary?,NOT

the fact that she made an apology video but left this up shows that she isn't sorry at all the fucked up part is i really don't think she has bad intentions i think she is just self-sabotaging self-involved and socially unaware but the road to hell is paved with good intentions and even if she somehow justified this in her mind as meaning no harm there is no excuse for ignorance of this level this video is just so tone deaf it gives me a headache and i truly hope she figures herself out off camera ,NOT

their not female accept the fact people have to stop pretending they believe in this stupidity for once and for all their males who want to be females stop calling these people trans gender you can't transition from gender your born with ok their males so why can't they identify as  year olds and compete there it's because if the government accepts people saying their in wrong body for age just imagine the uproar anyone could claim to be a pensioner and no one would ever have to work this is why it's not accepted to say your in wrong body for age so let's be straight and honest their not females no argument fact you can't change gender fact fact,ABU

i love animals i have kept many animals as pets during my life dogs cats canaries parrots fish everything you can think of but going vegan is also killing animals indirectly what do you think will happen to the domestic animal breeds such as sheep cows chicken and to a lesser extent pigs and goats i am not judging you or saying that you are wrong for not eating meat it's your choice i am just stating facts the current way of keeping domestic animals is cruel and it should be changed but eliminating meat from the diet of people is not the answer people don't eat dogs yet dogs suffer much more than farm animals to see what i am talking about i will give you an example i am mostly a catch and release fisherman but also i keep some fish you might say it's cruel but i am contributing for the fish population much more than you who aren't fishing or eating fish i pay a daily fee which is not cheap to fish.the law is that most of that money goes to fish stocking which means that thousands of fish are bred and released every year because of me and people like me so who is the real contributor to the wild waters here? me or you fish that is the daily limit on trout fishing are humanely killed to feed me and hundreds are released due to me.,NOT

welp quit watching after she said if women are paid so much less why don't businesses hire only women? buddy friend pal if you're still repeating that nonsense argument you clearly have nothing to contribute women are paid less because their work is valued less than men's. therefore businesses don't hire only women because they value women's work less would you hire a bunch of workers you believed are much lower quality workers simply so that you can pay them lower wages if you still lack this basic understanding of what the wage gap is then do not talk to me about why it's fake if you're going to argue against something know what it is first sigh,ABU

it's so funny to me how they all look sick with those sunken in eyes their wrinkled skin and pale skin color but they think they look great they look great when they start and they still have the nutrient reserves in their liver and body fat and they loose overweight from going vegan but then after a while they turn pale and gray loose often lots of muscle mass and facial fat giving them that formaldehyde dead eyes look it's sad people can't think logically and are so brainwashed with this anti human ideology it's almost as if they can't think clearly anymore and the more animated they act the more it looks as if they're trying to convince themselves they're not weak sick and unhealthy looking i've been looking long at going vegan wondering if it would be healthy thinking it probably would be but never started until i looked at the opposite side of this diet a.k.a the carnivore diet then it suddenly became very clear to me that veganism is an unnatural and unrealistic and polluting ideology that's based on new age drivel lies and deceit and not based on a biological reality we're ourselves animals with carnivores needs and we're not living on starship enterprise the planet would be better of if we all ate meat and let the animals freely graze on the planet everywhere since they can eat the plants we can't eat and we don't have to dig up the soil use pesticides or artificial fertilizers and nature could just be nature we just had to stimulate the facilitation for them to give lots of offspring and we could eat them without hardly any need for the cultivation of land destroying nature.,ABU

eat till your saturated not till your stuffed! if you eat till your stuffed evidently your going to gain weight so happy for trisha!!! ),NOT
so there is it's just that girls are conditioned to go into careers that we value less as a society and the small gap within careers has negotiating skills and self worth evaluation ability to factor in again conditioned by upbringing and society.,NOT
pay gap is it real or not theres so many controversial opinions about this but my opinion is somewhere in between information providing from some of the readings and viewings made me understand and gather some opinions of my own about gender pay gap/gendered labor i actually believe that men are more favored in high paying jobs than women are in adams et al he provided some ideas and real life situations that might cause women to get paid less hold a lower position or not getting hired at all one of them things he mentioned was that some businesses prefer males because in this gendered stereotypical society women are more likely to leave work or miss work for family stuff unlike men where they will choose work first to be able to provide for their family because of this idea that men focus on work more than women it allows men to get promoted easier or get hired first in his book he also provided a list of equal situations for both men and women and how each of them are perceived differently i don't necessarily think theres an accurate pay gap where a man and women with the same job title get paid differently but i do think men are likely to get promoted higher than a women in order to pay them more in the video there is no gender wage gap” she talked about how the wage gap isn't accurate because it counts for all women and all men working but it doesn't distinguishes between careers or whether they are part time or full time in her video i agree that more of the higher paying jobs is dominated by men and the lowest is dominated by women so of course you see the difference of the pay women and men get like she said it's a choice but its also society's fault for making some careers seem gendered for example engineers for men and teaching for women personally i'm a liberal studies major and i'm choosing a low paying job i'm not sure why or even if i want to do it anymore because of this topic but it was my choice to go for a less paying career.,NOT
is gender studies not one of the worst paying majors?,NOT
i like how freelee started to put graphic at the end of her titles so i am warned,NOT
i love you trisha but please look more into what being a transman means.,NOT
so what this is saying is that to end the wage gap a night job must pay the same as a day job and risky jobs must pay the same as safe jobs and remove the overtime extra pay sorry but that looks a bit unfair thanks for clearing up what you want done to end the wage gap.,NOT

ever thought men work harder than women ever thought maybe the man had been working there for longer than the women?,NOT
this on the right path by looking in to specific data that goes into the grossly misleading wage gap but even this draws ways too easy and broad conclusions there needs to be flexibility to account for the variety of working decisions woman make throughout their career the main focus should be on educating girls that they should be excited for any job that catches their eye like how nurses are still a taboo job for men) we have to get girls visualising themselves succeeding in male dominated roles elsewhere we should all be sharing info on our income to help all us in negotiating better salaries this should help disclose any lingering gender pay inequities as for the family that's up to the family to figure out if they want to have kids and this vid is promoting sexism by saying just mums have to work around their kids if that's how it is in your family that's your choice at the very least thats a social cultural issue not a pay work issue.,NOT

your diet choice doesn't matter vegan vegetarian etc it is about input and output!! what helps you lose weight is burning more calories than you consume that's science of course a well rounded diet whether it's vegan vegetarian whatever is best and staying active as well freelee is very active so yes she can eat alot of calories you also have to consider metabolism life stressors things like that affect weight loss and gain.,NOT

the statistic you start out with covers all jobs not just harvard-type office jobs please include the jobs that are more physically demanding dangerous it health-impacting because those are also in the original statistic and are done mostly by men men will do these jobs because a they pay more and b they are trying to support the women in their lives truck driving construction mining firefighting policing mechanic jobs and so on may have some representation by women but it tends to be small women tend to want the safe clean office jobs but who built the office buildings and got paid well for doing the rougher job in the end black lung disease is a male disease and men make up for a disproportionate share of workplace fatalities because they are trying to earn good money for their families and then they get dinged for earning more how heartless can you get?,NOT

nice and eye-opening thanks i'm also years late but apparently that's how youtube recommendations work. on the other hand even if 9 of the worse paying majors were male i still would like to see teachers early childhood educators included) psychologist and social workers earn more there is no sexism in this wish either just the thing that these people do a lot to individuals and in my opinion should be valued more this claim that women chooose to study things that lead to lower wages sounded a bit like blaming women for earning averagely somewhat less but then who would do these jobs also if some men didn't do the dangerous jobs who would trust me there are men who would never work on an oil rig and there are women who would never even touch an elderly gentleman or lady or care for them professionally if they can't do this on their own i forgot the word for the home where they live then. no i do not compare these jobs and you should neither do that because they are enterily different and not comparable i would like to add the situation in my country beginner teachers earn circa 628/65 usd per month without the taxes nurses or social workers who work with the elderly or homeless for example earn even less i now simply don't trust my owm calculations because it seems so few like - dollars/hour compared to american wages yes things are a bit cheaper there and we have free universities but my point is that these people do not earn enough money regardless of their gender. edit for correction of sentence-structures i struggle with english.),NOT

while this is interesting and re-contextualizes things neatly you've gotta wonder why literally all statistics show that women earn less even if it's not as big a gap as is usually mentioned we went from 0 to 0% is uplifting but it's also still 0% plus all the data you mention talks about women in positions of relative privilege so…of course they have it less bad than the average woman does.,NOT

this video is pretty accurate there is no gender pay wage gap in the workplace but that does not discount that it still exists due to societal sexism men and women may make the same amount in the same job but they are told from a younger age that those lower paying jobs are more likely to be a fit for them we are told to be teachers social workers and therapists while a man is often told he should be a doctor lawyer or scientist it's not on the workplace besides that . cents which is still not good but forgivable but rather on raising our girls to believe that they can do whatever they want to do!,NOT
you're little squeak when you fell lol you're so dang cute.,NOT
thank you you are amazing!,NOT
basically when you put in all the factors there is an actual gender wage gap but it's not as big as the general number that some people use equality is a long continuous battle that has gone on through history and will continue until everyone is totally and completely equal there will always be assholes and sexist out there same for racist but if we can change ourselves we can work to make that number smaller we do not live in a post feminist world just because we have the right to vote does not mean we have equality i think that should be noted and understood that it's the general mindset that we need to change.,NOT

the reason men make more is because they work more hours in the same jobs the reason they work more is because they're more ambitious on average the reason for this is because men are expected to earn money and pay for dates to court women women can always fall back on marrying rich so it stunts the ambition level of the average woman there isn't much that can be done about this as the root cause of these behaviors are biological let's just accept that there will be a pay gap but it's closed when you consider the paying-for-dates gap and the fact that women control 0 of consumer spending even though men make about 0 of the income in the usa what does that last piece of data show yes that men make the majority of income but women spend it they spend men's money ask any marketing or advertiser which gender they sell to have you ever heard of a woman called a deadbeat in our culture no why is that within that answer also lies the answer to the wage gap bandeadbeat,NOT

the video omits history and social context as well as clearly known facts that men by a wide margin outnumber women as chief executives in fortune 0 companies only  of all ceos in fortune 0 companies are women why men and women take different jobs is not a matter of choice but social norms history and context feminism understands these social norms to be corrosive to the broader social fabric when any sector of society has to struggle this hard to contribute that society serves its members poorly what can be the value of supporting one already dominating point of view that helps only a few what is the value of the inequality that this video supports?,NOT
how is this even a debate,NOT
trisha i am so proud of you i know it's hard giving up what your body craves but if you stick with it you won't miss animal products i promise it takes  days to form a habit anyway i am so proud of you and really proud that you're trying to hold yourself accountable my heart swelled when i saw this love ya girl 3,NOT
good job vox the video is both factually correct and proposes the solutions to solve the gender gap that exists in the same profession on the same position this an intellectually honest and interesting video the problem is that it will not solve the infamous  cents to a dollar since women will still be more likely to take part time job or be home stay mother and against what feminists say it is valid and respected choice) so this 9/10 should be dropped all together.,NOT
i'm so excited,NOT
i'm vegan too !!!,NOT
she needs a psychiatrist,NOT
some tips for eating vegan for the next two weeks love that you're doing this and being 00lb myself this could inspire me to maybe take that step for my health  look up recipes so that you can get more protein and healthy carbs buy more whole fruits and not packaged ones so you'll get more for your money and then just cut them up all at once when you have like half an hour so they're ready to go farmers markets which i'm sure la has a lot of have cheaper produce typically buy things like brown rice oats sweet potatoes etc so you can actually stay full eat fruits and esp veggies in abundance try lots of vegan restaurants bc la is vegan heaven! cook your veggies and season them well so they taste good and you actually want to eat them kisses and i hope this works out for you!!!!,NOT

this is all evidence towards that women are earning less because of their work place decisions not because of a apparent societal stigma against woman,NOT
soooo the feminists we wrong saying that the wage gap was caused by the sexist patriarchy?,NOT
simple truth men in same jobs do not make same pay either this is fact this is called negotiation men do not force their employers to pay equal to compensate for their varying negotiating ability save for strikes and union representation if women want true equality they just have to learn to negotiate better without coercion of the law or using their feminine character in any way learn to play the game they so desperately wish to a be a part of in a truly fair way.,NOT
"this channel should be put to death however everyone working at youtube believes that there is a wage cap with vox pushing on racial profiling such as their video,”walking while black” i'm surprised they haven't been taken down already.",NOT
this just sounds like there's way too many options in the world transgenderism has been glamourized so much lately through the media and now people who would have never even thought about it are questioning if that could be them so now we have a very girly woman saying that she's a transgendered gay man drag queen.. edit the transgender community is calling to everyone nowadays because it's become the popular thing it seems wonderful by the current portrayal.,NOT

how can you make a video about the wage gap without mentioning the wage gap between black and white?,NOT
exactly if i could hire someelse to do the job for less i would right now wages are my biggest expense,NOT
why is it necessary to explain the obvious its sad that people are so ignorant not to figure it alone.,NOT
i just don't see how a wage gap matters much when you're making 00k+.,NOT
men on average earn more than women especially mothers stop shaming women professionals and saying they are less driven its society's construct that prevents mothers from free daycare maternity leave and a reasonable schedule is demanded by both mean and women!,NOT

i am mostly vegan myself but.. i don't think this is a good film i don't think a daily meat eater feels much incentive to keep watching after the first few minutes minutes or even seconds that's the audience you want to reach right? not the people who already agree with you!! it's so judgmental so preachy so condescending the people you are trying to reach hate that!,NOT
they/them is confusing it's literally just respecting people's pronouns they will tell you their prom puns and you will call them that,NOT
last summer i worked as a waiter at a college one month i got paid 15 more than one of my counterparts who just happened to be a woman modern feminism would look at this and say that the college i worked for was sexist as me being a male earned more than my female counterpart what they would overlook is the fact that i worked more over time and didn't take any of my earned holiday and so was compensated for it at the end of the month i did this not because men work harder but because i had student debt to pay off) in this case i was on the exact same salary about 1 an hour and was contracted for  hours a week this is a prime example of how the wages and earnings are two totally different things you can be on the same salary but have different incomes depending on holidays taken and overtime worked its a shame feminism has gotten caught up in this hysterical regressive liberal movement as feminism is one of the greatest triumphs of the 0th century,NOT
its easy for a woman to earn as much as the men in her field she just has to work as hard and as many hours as them and deliver the same results in most cases to achieve and sustain this may imply not having children.,NOT

even if trish is just doing it for attention at least she is getting the message out to her fans and subscribers and perhaps encourage them to do the same nothing wrong with that,NOT
don't business like investment for example hire men more often because the people paying for this feel more comfortable with a man instead of a women explaining this stuff it's sexism but it's what happens stem jobs don't really matter though since as long as the job is done it's done.,NOT
i have no problem with vegan but a vegan sausage roll and vegan hot dogs that's all just more processed foods we eat meatless occasionally and it's tacos with veggies and beans not processed junk that is chemically processed to be like meat they are feeding everybody fake processed meat that not healthy.,NOT

i give mike mccloskey a great deal of respect for coming out and owning up to the truths exposed in the expose perhaps he can transition his business to a successful and sustainable vegan farm and offer truly educational tours to the public most of us contributed to animal agriculture in one way or another until we were fortunate enough to witness it and have the chance to change our ways i wish him the best financially and spiritually in a new kind and merciful venture.,NOT

actually they do take into account occupation education and position another part of the wage gap is that men are more likely to get bonuses than women who work the same hours and are more likely to get promoted if a women tries to discuss/negotiate a higher salary then she is needy if a man does the same he's a leader.,NOT

i am not vegan or vegetarian at the moment but i have been watching your vlogs for a while and i have a few ideas that i think could help i have noticed that you don't cook for yourself all that often(which honestly i don't either lol however being vegan i hear that you have to learn how to cook or you will get really bored of the food you eat i think it would be smart to look at a lot of the vegan restaurants or healthy restaurants around your area and find out what you like if you do this you have somewhere to eat when you go out and you can always post mate it when you don't feel like cooking again i am not speaking from experience but i feel as though finding these restaurants will open your eyes to new vegan foods you might like and you would have no excuse to not eat vegan good luck trisha!,NOT

“i choose not to identify as multiple personalities i just finished watching her did/personality disorder/alters video 🏻‍♀️,NOT
this video is ridiculous the problem is that women are paid less for doing the same job so when a field employs more women the average income in that field decreases because women are paid less than men the reverse is also true men get paid more for the same job so a field's annual income will average out higher because they hire mostly men.,NOT

yeees it was the best choice of my life when i went vegan it´s ok to have setbacks so just focus on the times you do eat vegan especially when it´s hard like when you go out with friends to eat burgers or have a barbeque eating vegan is fun just go for a vegan raid in the grocery store and other places you can also order alot online hm yummy stuff.. well their is ice cream made from tofu or oat d and you can mae yummy smoothies from fruit like bananas and dates spiced with cinnamon or vanilla d and i love you for doing this  very good you don´t just get mad at freelee and such you really listen and think.. big hug  lina sweden,NOT
i'm not particularly a vegan but i do enjoy the vegan diet and vegan products that being said i know you really like toast so i recommend buying the vegan butter that is at trader joe's honestly so much better than regular butter!,NOT

❤️🤓✨yeah!!!! más veganos cada año go vegan go activism go to the liveration animal 🏻,NOT
this shouldn't even be a debate regardless of which gender you identify as it doesn't change the scientific fact that genetically speaking men are predominantly stronger than women therefore to deny that someone who was born a male has an unfair advantage competing against women is ridiculous i don't make the genetic rules they just are what they are and for the record i'm happy for this kid if she is living the life she wants to live if she's happy that's all that matters but you cannot deny scientific facts and expect people to agree with you.,NOT
ain't gay but that pink kitchen theme is adorable.,NOT
so basically the wage gap is real but only because our society still hasn't figured out that women's purpose isn't to care for the kids,NOT

im a vegetarian and i really want to go vegan slowly cutting animal products at of my diet but its hard  but still trying,NOT
a great video but there will most likely always be a wage gap because a man who works longer and more often should get payed more than a woman who doesn't and vice versa.,NOT
i appreciate this study however most of the points it makes for reasons women do not work late is children the conservative side argues that women in general do not work longer hours before i accept this video at face value i would like to see the same study for women without children and see if the wage gap still exists there if it does your video might need some rethinking if it does not your video is legit and make sure the ages of the childless women are about the same as the ages of the women with children or the conservative side will argue that women tend to work harder at an earlier age and that the earlier aged men slack off more than their older counterparts have to have all bases covered,NOT
if trisha does one of her dramatic crying-on-the-kitchen-floor responses to this i will be so amused.,NOT
why are those boys dressed like girls ,ABU

what's with all the dislikes this was a perfectly rational video let me guess it was people who who don't believe the wage gap exists and were too stupid to understand that the video was in agreeance?,NOT
that part where you said that who you are attracted to has nothing to do with what you identify as....lol...blaire now you know the lgbt is gonna say something on that  i know what you mean though but someone else won't lol because someone's going to say well because i'm attracted to women identify as lesbian or because i am attracted to men i identify as gay lol so yeah that part might get some backlash. keep up your videos love. you always help me cheer up cause you are super funny🙏💓,NOT
i recommend eating enough carbs so that you don't have lots of cravings and feel satisfied whilst you're not eating animal products.,NOT
i wanna fuck that young blonde with the bleached hair oh and why are males allowed to run against females?? they're male period.,ABU

you know veganism is taking off when even burger king is offering plant based options.,NOT
i am sorry i am not able to understand something here isn't wage gap issue regarding the difference in payment for same work done we are still comparing the women's salaries to there men counterparts isn't that exactly what the problem is if the job hours are from - the women has no obligation to stay back for a meeting at and person's other priorities like children etc cannot be criticized by people and should not affect the wages of a job which he/she are doing well.,NOT
ok so now i feel like a female boxing let's crush now some girl face and get cup and gold medal for free.,ABU

hi freelee i've been watching through a lot of your videos recently and you have been such an inspiration that i really think i wanna go vegan in the near future luckily i'm moving back onto campus in weeks where i'll have access to a full kitchen and away from my large family that i live with who makes having a different eating lifestyle a difficult task) but my main concern is will i be able to make sure my body is getting what it needs i have problems with my appetite and rarely feel hungry the act or even just the thought of eating most of the time makes me nausous and dizzy it's extremely unhealthy i know and i wanna work towards fixing it have you encountered anyone who had this problem what kind of tips can you recommend on ways to make sure i'll be eating enough to live heathily on a vegan lifestyle it would mean the world to me if you could point me in the right direction or if anyone else has any words of wisdom.,NOT

i'd recommend looking up the youtuber unnatural vegan she makes easy satisfying and realistic recipes and she also goes into the science of what you need for daily intake to make sure you're getting all the nutrients such as protein and b12).,NOT
great presentation and makes sense the only problem i have is with the title it is incredibly misleading the reality is there is a significant gender wage gap however you look at this women work less hours do less dangerous work and essentially whine more in new york city young professional women make more money doing the same job as their male counterparts in addition lesbians and black women make more money than their white counterparts doing the same work why because they tend to put in longer hours but regardless there is a gender wage gap lol !,NOT
she is trolling you all d,NOT

but she seems so comfortable with her boobs and her womanly figure..? no dysphoria surely she'd hate her body,NOT
trish has mental issues she needs to get that blond wig off an read books instead of breathing in that hot air into her head i never liked her to begin with and yet ik something ain't right about her since she gained popularity she's just an attention seeker it's annoying trishapaytasisover,ABU
hmm so my military experience schooling and various community dealings should account for nothing in regards to my payscale i suppose the way i see it is the men are almost always doing the manual labor positions they are the primary individuals fighting wars and i respect the fact that this video didn't come off as how i initially thought it would.,ABU
well freelee can eat a ton cuz shes a raw vegan but just cuz ur vegan doesnt mean all vegan food is healthy lots of vegan food can still have lots of fat and and sugar in it. and u also realize most vegans w that body also work out. a lot raw alignment is a great vegan channel here on youtube along with kalel!,NOT
in the video there is no gender wage gap it starts off by stating a statistic that a lot of sources use that women are paid  cents per every male dollar from the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real?” it states that women are paid  cents to every male dollar which is not far off from  cents the video i watched had a female presenting all the stats and opinions which is very clever by prager u who posted the video why not show a female talking about how there is no gender wage gap it just adds onto their argument the video states that if a person factors in different choices each gender makes on top of occupation position education and hours per week then then the wage gap nearly diminishes down to . cents i feel as if a person cannot just factor in choices” because not everyone is in the same situation many women want families so when women are pregnant they go on maternal leave as long as they need or are allowed also women have been proven to do more work around the house and also take time off to be there for their kids women cannot be discriminated against just because of their choices it does not matter their choices also the video does not take into account the fact of race as we learned in class black and hispanic women are paid a lot less than women who are white or asian which is from the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real?” overall we can each have our own opinion if there is or is not a gap but the video there is no gender wage gap is filled with fallacies that are opinion based and not fact and research based like the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real?”.,NOT
being mean to t is not going to make you feel better ya losers :3,NOT

tbh i thin there should always be on person being the houshold caretaker and one to provide for the household and not both working at the same time,NOT

mommy tang and hot for food are the best channels to help you on your vegan journey!!!,NOT
look it is a dis-honest to demand for income equality between men and women women get maternity leaves when they're pregnant men don't so demanding to get paid for the time you don't work is not nice men are not hesitated to work long hours or even being asked to work long hours women can't work for long hours and they literally need not we live in a capitalist economic country where one earns as much as he works we don't live in a socialistic economy where what you earn is regardless of how much you work equal pay between sexes is not really practical.,NOT
unfortunately women take up more household related tasks because of children because there is a level of biology that plays a part in which preferences both genders have vox couldn't and wouldn't state this because it is deemed as somehow sexist and politically incorrect.,ABU

it not true make and females paid same,NOT
my mother makes more than my father quite interesting that vox posted something...sensible.,NOT
women are choosing to raise children and that's what is increasing the gap so it's their fault yeah ill believe that when paid paternity leave is a thing i guarantee most women who choose to leave their jobs because of giving birth do it because the husband can't get paternity leave make paternity leave a thing and i guarantee the gender wage gap will decrease right now american society basically forces women to leave their jobs unless they already have enough money for private child care and most don't,NOT

your gender is t just own it and be how you wanna be lol,NOT
the problem is that sexism keeps women out of the higher paying fields and positions and thus pushes them towards the lower paying majors.,NOT
they have a huge advantage you cant deny it its totally not fair to the rest of the team you cant deny the difference in physical strengh between male and female its not allowing the girls on the team to excell and maybe make a state championship or get a college schlorship it seems to me they expect everyone to bow down to them and to bad if you dont like it as long as their happy thats all they seem to care about you can be transgender all you want but some things about your birth identity will never change.,ABU
our fires are being intentionally started they want us all off of our land and want to move us into stack and pack apartment buildings so they can keep us all under control. we will not be able to farm on our own anymore i am vegan but i also believe this is an evil agenda yes plants are great but i don't believe we can get all of our nutrients from plants i have to supplement also our crops are being sprayed with glyphosate ruining our gut health,ABU

yas queen i'm so happy your trying vegan i made the change myself and it's been amazing thing you should do/know always look at your nutrition labels for certain products and make sure the ingredients are wholesome/natural eggplant is very good try baking that or roasting it with olive oil nuts seeds berries are great for snaking avocado is very good and instead of dairy milk which isn't nutritional at all by the way i know i was fooled too try using coconut milk or silk vanilla which is soy milk grilling certain fruits such as mango really changes the flavor and grilled watermelon would be perfect look up vegan recipes and hire someone to cook for you if you don't have the time i'm so happy for you trisha and i hope it goes well for you xoxo ),NOT
honestly at one point it was 0.75c then 0.82c now 0.79c make up your damn mind,NOT

"there's a little bit of a misstatement at :1  men make 0 more than women"". when you compare the ratio of one value to another the primary/original/base value  that is the one being compared to  always goes on the bottom of the ratio so while men at 00k do make 0 more than women at 50k women at 50k actually make 7.5 less than men at 00k or stated conversely those women make 2.5 of what the men make written out women compared to men is 250/400-1)*10 for men compared to women it's 400/250-1)*100",NOT

just how fucked are we completely.,NOT
medical science knows males have a physical advantage in sports over females the advantage line in running sports is the natural female hip spread it is a bigger distance between the legs that naturally takes longer to move in an oscillating motion it is why the stroke in the diesel engines doesnt allow for high rpms without breaking apart.,NOT

gtfoh...if that ain't cheating your an idiot,NOT
finally huntyyyyy!!!! okay okay so i'm gonna start off by saying you probably gained weight on a vegetarian diet because of the dairy which is arguably worse then meat! okay so some snacks you could do are potatoes literally potatoes are your best friend my favorite is japanese sweet potatoes because yes another thing is if you want to make something that requires eggs use flax seed eggs as a vegan alternative which you can get a target  as far as milk i prefer sweetened almond milk over soy milk,NOT
yasss my life is complete love you both,NOT
yeah dating as a trans guy is really hard you wouldn't understand,NOT
sorry off-topic what is that lip product you are rocking i love it!!!,NOT
ok first of all don't listen to the bullshit pseudoscience out there raw diets hclf etc.) i highly recommend unnatural vegan she backs up all her claims with science and evidence make sure you're eating plenty of tofu legumes nuts and seeds find what works for you supplement for nutrients that will be hard to get such as iron calcium and b12 go to the doctor after two weeks and have a blood test and a check up and see how you're doing good luck!,NOT
this week on buzzfeed unsolved trisha paytas i am transgender,NOT

the wage gap is a myth and doesn't account for different jobs hours worked and paid leave,NOT
she already lost bc she ate meet l,NOT
even if you don't stay vegan after the weeks much respect for giving it a go  as for diet advice ideally you would track your calories so you don't under eat too much or over eat usually people under eat on a vegan diet) rice pasta potatoes beans lentils chickpeas vegetables mock meats mock cheeses 'violife etc not sure what's available for you) non dairy milk i like almond milk myself fruit is also great however i disagree that you can eat as many calories as you like take a b1 supplement i take veg1 which has vitamin d and others too good luck!,NOT
it's so interesting that you've never used the fact you are trans as evidence of your claim like so many people who say if you aren't trans/black/female etc you can't talk about blah blah blah. even though that act is so subtle in your videos i think it's a really powerful move anyway you dissected this well and i hope you are right about this whole thing being a fad even if it fades out soon it'll still leave a huge dent in the progress for lgbt acceptance your words are comforting i just hope you are right.,NOT
this is so lit the vegan life is awesome and its so wonderful that you made this decision on your own i love you!,NOT

i don't give a fuck if reality offends you men or bigger stronger and outreach better at physical competition than women it is unfair for a man to compete in a physical competition against a woman this is stupid,ABU
those who claim that the wage gap does depend on more factors then just gender btw i dont believe in the wage gap wil then say that there is still sexism because woman care for children and thus cant work first im sorry to be that guy but biology sort of decided that or god if u like fairytales because woman mentally and physically are better at child caring then men who are better at hard work and hunting for the family to survive and second i believe that just like here in europe families should get paid when a woman cant work so its still fair so when a child is born the man can work and woman gets some money but less and the company the woman works for doesnt have to pay the woman but gets a cut of the money that would go to the woman so the woman wont get fired and thus chaos within the household wont happen and a child can growup with the attention of a mother which it needs,NOT
what criteria do you use to determine who is male and who is female it is hard to tell nowadays with the transgender movement.,NOT

very unfair get a period!,ABU
0:0 if women only make  cents for every dollar a man makes why don't businesses hire just women explain that women who take advantage of the wage gap myth to earn more than men,NOT
regarding your weight you may notice some fluctuations in your weight because your metabolism will be changing weeks is a relatively short amount of time so i would encourage you to keep being vegan even after your music video to see how it affects your body also regarding food eat as many fruits and veggies as you want and if you are feeling hungry make sure to eat more potatoes and beans nuts are also a very good source of protein if you're worried about being protein deficient the worst thing you can do on a vegan lifestyle is starve yourself so just make sure that you are always full from healthy food good luck!,NOT
y'all bitches just mad because y'all lost shut up 😂,NOT
here are some factors on why men tend to earn more men choose higher paying jobs women tend to focus on jobs caring for others teachers nurses daycare home health workers etc...while men enjoy stem fields which are higher paying men put in more hours at work than women do and therefore are earning more if paid by the hour or earn more in commissions for making more sales because men put in more hours and maybe work nights and weekends they get more experience and are therefore more valuable which justifies pay raises and promotions women often leave the workforce to have kids this means that when/if they return they have to start from scratch while the men who were hired originally with the women have been promoted women aren't as aggressive in negotiating their pay when hired and/or promoted nor are they as aggressive in seeking/demanding promotions women are more likely to stay with a company that turned them down for a raise/promotion they are risk adverse men are less afraid of risk and will look elsewhere if they are passed over for a promotion or are denied a raise companies know this and therefore are more likely to give men that raise/promotion rather than face the higher risk of them leaving since women work less than men companies aren't going to offer women promotions if the promotion would require them to work longer hours women won't accept such promotions as often as men and the companies know that she is likely to turn it down so they offer it to the equally qualified man rather than having the man knowing that he was the nd choice since women tend to seek husbands who earn more than they do women are much more likely to have a higher earning spouse than a man this means that the women will be less likely to accept a promotion requiring more time/travel since she may not need the money as much as the man with a lower earning spouse the woman's husband is also less likely to accept the wife being on the job more hours and he will also be less willing to move if the woman's promotion requires it he may not be able to make the same money if the new town while the spouse of the male employee will be much more likely to find similar paying work these factors discourage women from accepting such promotions and knowing this the company is also less likely to offer it to a woman over an equally qualified man women with higher earning husbands feel less pressure to enter less attractive but higher paying fields they gravitate to jobs that they like men tend to have lower earning spouses and therefore are forced to choose higher paying jobs even if it's much less enjoyable all of the above show why men on an annual basis earn more than women there is nothing that attributes the difference to sexism it's all about personal choices that men and women freely make.,NOT
i think that video was satire actually not a troll video.,NOT

i've been a vegan for about years now and i'm just gonna tell you it takes a lot of fucking patience the first month is gonna be like hell you have no idea what to eat and you're gonna feel like shot sometimes but after that it's pretty damn awesome i've lost like 0kg and i can gain and lose weight pretty easily if i eat the right stuff unfortunately i love fried shit) my tips are that you should start with being a vegetarian and eating less meat if you cut out all meat and shit like that at once you're just gonna binge on it later what me and a lot of my friends did) then you should eat grains and beans so you get stuffed and get used to the calories oh and don't forget the bananas you better eat a lot of them the biggest mistake i probably made was threat i didn't really explore so much i basically ate the same things everyday and got bored so try out new things as often as you can it helped me lose the weight a lot faster too i have no idea why love you!,NOT

i know i'm gonna sound like a complete idiot to all the people who believe this video but you're just basing everything on a video that has no sources to what they're saying and people say that all the butthurt feminists disliked this let me just clarify i'm a male not trans bi gay or anything like that before i'm gonna hear any excuse on why i'm wrong for being a feminist that wants more than just equality one point that i see is not very believable is that it has to do with career choices i'm pretty sure no matter the career choice a person makes there is always a man at that job that you can compare the money gap in unless we're talking about strippers those are separated) if they just based it on all women then yes of course the money amount would be less but it's not about the career choice it's about the money that a man and woman makes on the same job not on the career choice of both genders some countries the wage gap is almost not even there but i've had this explained by people who aren't females just say i'm making this shit up for all i care i just want to get my statement across.,NOT

i think trisha embodies a 950s housewife unfortunately for her and that's the only problem i see here i believe she's confusing gender identity with normal things every person experiences because of this what she says doesn't show me gender confusion it shows me a woman who grew up insecure overcompensated and became overexposed and never learned the concept of acceptance i have pity for her and i think a lot of other people should too.,NOT

men try to earn a higher salary as a way to get a wife this is obviously truer between the age of  and 5-40 when men are more likely to be looking for a wife then there's the fact that men are more likely to be relied on as a breadwinner not sure that is a social privilege to be honest so they work longer hours with less flexible and favourable conditions and negotiate more aggressively for salary women don't generally prioritise work in the same way so they n average earn less very simple there is no need to forcibly engineer society the way feminists want to see it there is no wage gap the proposed solutions for it are almost invariably profoundly sexist and illiberal also focusing on making hours flexible rather than on the quality of the end product/service sounds like a recipe for a failed company.,NOT

as a loan officer at bofa so during the course of a day i would ask several people how much money the husband and the wife makes i found in the vast majority of families it is actually the woman with the stable job who makes more money but when they average in the the high wage earner males into it it appears that men make more so for example out of couples would have the wife who makes more money they fourth the husband may make more than all of other men and women put together i am guessing that are looking the the numbers in the fourth family the wife is likely to not work at all so they would count her income as zero because her husband makes more money then all of the other people combined they would then say men make more money on the other hand i find liberals lie about statistics and really bend the rules to come up with the result they want to come up with.,NOT

officially convinced shes loosing it,NOT
so basically one of the main reasons for the pay gap is because women take care of the kids what a twist there are also other factors that greatly inflate the most commonly sighted statistic i also noticed that the graph showing wage gap distribution between different types of occupations ranges from . and 0.5 while this video is pretty biased it's at least well researched and has some useful information so long as you take it with a grain of salt just be aware that they only covered a small part of the problem and said problem tends to be greatly exaggerated and now i realize that this video came out years ago and i'm probably gonna be blasted from both sides of the argument if this comment section is still active.,NOT
"so this video says that the wage gap doesn't come down to gender but what a woman can achieve versus what a man can achieve a woman has to take care of children and has more duties outside of her job so she cannot be as reliable on her job as a man thus she cannot be as good as her job as a man and that is for every job that requires flexible hours like business careers thus she gets paid as much as a man given her achievements this is very interesting that being said why is the conclusion we need jobs to be more flexible for women and not we need to balance housework between men and women"" how is it normal for a woman to have more duties outside of her work than a man don't both parents have as much responsibility towards their own children towards their own house?",NOT

this is her truth who is anyone to question or judge her for it you don't have to understand it it's what was on her heart and what she lives with if she wants to be gender fluid it's her life . let people live can't you just create a safe space for people to be without all this nonsense in the comments y'all are fu€£ng weirdos.,NOT
i'm seeing people telling you to just buy the vegan versions of non-vegan food that's totally fine but just make sure you're not eating that all the time avoid all the highly processed stuff btw if you have a good diet you don't really have to restrict calories,NOT
so an appeal to our emotions attempting to make us feel sorry for them because they are trans while trying to make the people who feel they have an unfair seem petty.,NOT
i have five points about the wage gap  if it were really true why wouln't companies just hire all women instead of men and make an additional 9 in profits for their share holders i am sure no one would complain if a company hired all women in fact it would be celebrated as a trail blazer  do we think that every plumber the vast majority of them are men by the way in new york gets paid the exact same amount for unclogging a toilet if not there is a wage gap  why is it not your responsibility to know what you are worth and negotiate what you think is fair if you get what you think you are worth there is no wage gap if you don't know or underestimate your worth it is your problem the last time i checked indentured labor is against the law so if you are not paid what you are worth it is your responsibility to find another job that pays you a fair wage  some people both men and women will accept less than the market wage in order to compensate for their lack of experience or education it is an opportunity for them to join the workforce and prove their worth this is essential for competition keeping wages in check and giving people a chance to enter their profession of choice  what are we doing about the wage gap between blacks whites asians non-asians vegetarians non-vegetarians muslims christians or any other classification of people we can think of.,NOT

freelee is kinda the reason i stopped eating meat i wasn't really interested or thought about it much until i started seeing all the vegan channels that are starting and everyone was always talking about how freelee is a bitch in the comments of other videos i watched so of course i had to see how much of a bitch she was and stuff she said just kinda made sense you know i'm not fully vegan but i'm going to be living on my own soon and buying my own groceries so i plan to make that transition then,NOT
this video actually proved that the wage gap doesn't exist.,NOT
thank you so much the world really needed this.,NOT
i don't follow her but to me it just sounds like she's confused maybe instead of shaming her ppl just leave her alone to figure it out,NOT

why do so many people follow that hideous looking thing im lucky ive never heard of it.,NOT
lowkey waiting for freelee to make a vid😂😂😂,NOT
here is my thoughts on the matter like it matters wich it proberly dont the left have been far to fast on this one they ignored various of things men are faster stronger.. so we can defo argue its cheating but the root of the real issue is no women stopped it no one took a rational discussion on this those who tried failed so it derailed to be something perverse and stupid mostly stupid did a few doctors say well the this is wrong proberly did a few say its right sure was the cummonity agreeing on this yeah defo their own that is what about the other part fact of the matter its now they talk out and not when it could be stopped and tested in a prober manner this is just stupid and bad for eavryone involved.. and i do not get why no testing was done and such was done but the other side is equal at fault here they didnt speak up thats my opnion hoped you enjoyed.,NOT
yes queen spend money at chick fil a the gays can't handle it,NOT
it is not really true you cant just eat as much as you want on a vegan diet it is just that if you are on a raw vegan diet or raw till four trying to eat those 00 kcal on raw fruit and vegetables might be a little difficult because of the amount of food you gotta eat to eat enough?.. d so that is why they say eat as much as you want but in fact you can be vegan and overeat if you eat only vegan breads grains potatoes oils too much nuts etc. i think if i am wrong can anybody explain it better?? d ,NOT
the wage gap only refers to woman who are not poc the stats would be more valid if you took an intersectional approach.,NOT
i think we need to examine the craig gap because it sounds like everyone makes more money than me (,NOT
stop saying wage gap' women make the same amount of men per hour however because they don't complete the same hours they also don't go into the same fields as men they choose less paying jobs that's why there is an illusion that women make  cents on the dollar.,NOT
no matter how much they mutilate their bodies take test blockers and inject estrogen you are still physically and biologically male that will never change how science/medicine has allowed these people to mutilate their bodies knowing full and well this is a form of body dysmorphic disorder is disgusting for exploiting these individuals and pushing this agenda.,ABU

this isn't a complicated argument potentially this is feminism clashing with the lgbtq agenda....dance my puppets dance!!,NOT
lol you're showing these graphs of how much chores men and women do and how much time they spend with the kids that stuff is so biased those aren't things you can measure those statistics were probably aquired by asking women their opinions on how much their husbands help around of course it'd be low.,NOT
of course she said it in a more proficient way then i would but i could make the same point there is no such thing as gender inequality,NOT
 minutes and  seconds to prove the opposite of your point good job,NOT
i think im going blind the title says why i'm going vegan am i blind someone tell me wait wtfff,NOT
this is a great and much needed video but we should make working times more flexible just to shrink the wage gap but instead to help a lot of peoples mental health as jobs with long working hours are largely responsible for stuff like depression anxiety and so on so we should be focusing more on that as it will also help shrink the wage gap as well,NOT

thats fucking awesome!!!! trish one thing though... try it for at least a month because weeks is not enough to see the results not only on your weight but also on the energy and health watch lots of what i eat in a day vegan videos on youtube it'll give you tons of ideas on what to eat and also you should read the book the starch solution it helped me a lot when i transitioned good luck and i hope you are going to keep it up!,NOT
wage gap isn't real,NOT

1 this video specifically asserts that there is not a a wage discrepancy due to sexism or anything like that  this video attributes the cause of what wage discrepancy to the different occupations women choose to take.  this video recognizes that women are more likely to raise children and does not suggest that this should change  this video acknowledges that as jobs become more flexible child care becomes less of a conflict and thus narrows the otherwise natural gap.  this video does not suggest that anything needs to be done other than maybe encourage possibilities that make occupations more versatile they don't argue that any sexism exists in the first place to fix but merely that the wage gap will disappear as jobs become more flexible come on people if you want to argue against the ignorance spouted about how sexist the world is make sure that you're actually targeting the right things if anything this video attacks the fallacy of the 7 cents figure.,NOT
you need to get your protein in either by vegetables or protein shake without any dairy in it also a b1 supplement if you don't you can get a major headache and feel like crap,NOT

there is still a problem women still staying at home taking care of the kids because the majority of men refuse to that makes quite a portion of women in marriage leave their jobs and not make any money it affects statistics it doesn't mean that women are paid less just like you said but it is still sexism another problem may be the way we are socialized a study shows that women in general have way less self-esteem than men this influences career chooses while men tend to go for a harder degree women with the same grades go for a easier one that happens because men usually overrate their capabilities while women do the opposite that kind of justifies the fact that there are so many men studying engeneering and so many women at magistrate degrees another fact is that wherever there is a space with a high proportion of male presence that space is masculinified and it pushes away many women from taking a step an being part of it at last but not least there are some studies which show that women tend to choose careers in relation to caring of others like pedagogy related degrees or healthcare) and those of course are not tastes we are born with there are a whole lot of psychology studies that show us the evidence about that i say that as a psychologist) well i think i left a lot of room for yall to think some of these thoughts of mine are only hypothesis but im pretty sure that they will turn out to be true if somebody makes a research.,NOT
i love you omg,NOT
i think it's simply because she wants gay men to be attracted to her,NOT
want to be a woman procreate then...what that's physically impossible you mean it's all in their heads sounds like mental illness to me...,ABU
smartlife smart patties so good just like a burger if you want to feel like you're eating what you used to eat the fake meats potatoes things that are startchy they're filling high carb and so satisfying.,NOT
so people have a problem with these two yet bash folks when they don't want to be involved or around trans/gay people we spend to much time worrying about the wrong shit we pick and choose the things we wish to complain about much respect to the parents for accepting the kids.,NOT
or we should pay them both equally so whoever wants to stay home can stay home and have the job they want to someone want stay home and have kids that's great for them somebody else wants to go to work men women it doesn't matter we should treat them like human beings with dignity and respect,NOT
well all they are trying to do is to poison people what fake meat open your eyes well if you believe them that's your problem because on the vegan diet you wil die faster anyway lol,NOT
up in 01 the wage gap doesn't exist it's basically what job you have and if what kind of position you have at that job such as manger or co manger or janitor or cashier an pc men or more willing to do overtime if your not on salary and most of these points are when woman were allowed to be paid less so the wage gap is just another bullshit feminist reason to start problems yes you are right it did exist then but now it's impossible or if it happens it's most likely jail time i but tbh i just want triggered femnazis saying the wage gap is still that thing in the comments lel,NOT
that video was a little different in my opinion i legit feel like trisha just wants so badly to belong somewhere that's she's just grabbing at straws now and not caring who she hurts on her way i don't think this is her trolling i think this is her desperately trying to inject herself somewhere anywhere she thinks she might be accepted.,NOT
no one mentions the gender spend gap women love to shop and flash hubby s credit cards while hubby is slogging his guts out at work.,NOT
why does it have to be about gender maybe the men got rewarded for harder work better performance i mean it doesn't have to be about gender just about who does better.,NOT
this is awesome -^,NOT
can't wait for the debunkers that will tear this narrative apart lies and fud masters at work here this is a propaganda blitz first extinction rebellion then game changers and now this bullshit vegan2019 don't fall for it people it's just another attempt to control the population listen to alan savory and the proponents of regenerative farming we need more cows and ruminants to heal the earth and produce the food of the world.,ABU
fuck you piece of shit you just cheating the system.,ABU
just form transgender teams,NOT
so im trying to become vegan slowly but surely i wanted to ask is pizza sauce vegan ive looked it up and there are many answers so i need help im making a cauliflower pizza and i wanted to make sure before i ate it p,NOT
go to last week tonight jone oliver he explained a little better i could understand him more,NOT
sounds like you may be genderfluid....,NOT
check out a youtube channel called the vegan corner makes all kinds of vegan friendly dishes like lasagna brownies curry tortillas cinnabons etc.you are definitely going to want to make at least one meal instead of eating just strictly fruits and vegetables all day that's usually what i do i snack all day on fruits and veggies and make a vegan friendly meal during the part of the day where i have the most time also you're gonna hear a lot about smashing carbs and calories don't do that when you're starting out eat as much as you'd like but don't overeat to the point where you're too full that will just make you end up feeling kind of sick i have binging problems i just feel like sometimes i have a void that i need to fill so veganism is great for me because i can literally just eat and eat and not gain any weight from it those baby carrots are great for binging if you ever have an urge same with celery apples anything that requires a good amount of chewing don't be afraid to use some peanutbutter or humus with some of those things too the great thing about being vegan is you can eat two or three times the amount of salad and it'll make up one little cheeseburger from mcdonalds speaking of burgers try some veggie burgers trader joe's has pretty good ones or you could look up recommendations online even when i was a meat eater i still preferred them over an actual beef burger and don't think that just because you're vegan means you can't eat junk food you can still eat chips oreos fritos nutter butters poptarts etc just google if vegan friendly foods and you should get a huge list also continue researching on veganism in your free time you really do so much good to the world just by doing that one simple thing of choosing something different to eat for your dinner it's kind of like recycling you feel like it doesn't do much but when you join a group of people who's goal is the same it has a bigger effect than you think hope veganism goes well for you!,NOT
i suspect a slight bias.,NOT
be careful to not follow what freelee says because she works out like hardcore and a lot of people had the misconception that they could eat whatever they wanted and no exercise but you can't i've heard a lot of people gained weight after doing that so just be careful and you go girl!,NOT

vox smarter than buzzfeed,NOT
i'm a cis woman and i think trisha is being ridiculous she says she's a trans man and then in the next video she's sitting there in her bra wtf:,NOT
"trisha i love you 00x more! while eating vegan you want to subsribe to freelee jk you want to eat high proportions of everything eat lots of healthy carbs like rice pasta and other grains have lots of fiber like chickpeas,beans etc if you're going to stay vegan which i would love then you want to take a vegan multivitamin and be sure you're getting zinc b1 and iron also hope this helped alittle. love youu",NOT
it's only unfair because they're winning once they start getting beat by biological females nobody in this comment section will care anymore if you support transgenders being able to use the women's restroom you support them being able to participate in women's sports as well it is what it is.,NOT
maybe you are genderqueer idk,NOT
"if u freeze the grapes they will be like candy!!!! u should watch what i eat in a day vegan, check out thriving on plant youtube channel!!! amazing",NOT

i love you,NOT
lol the feminists and the transgender wack jobs are finally going to turn on themselves i mean we're all equal until men have a psychological disorder and compete with and bury women but that's not fair ,ABU
oh congrats! we love you be sure you've got a good blender for soups and smoothies :,NOT
"these dumb triggered feminist need to stop talking about the wage gap.there is literally a law that you can not pay someone less based on there sex,race,and religion.",NOT
ok so let's reverse the situation a girl born a girl transitions to a boy with some hormone therapy now basically this person is going to get dusted and there's no doubt about it and i bet if they weren't so bias and weren't trans they would say boy what are you doing on that team you finna get dusted and look stupid and that's how those girls on that team felt about themselves when the transgenders joined the team and i don't mean that in a harsh way but they need a reality and check and try not to be so selfish because they have about every right we have but let's keep the sports fair at least),ABU
why not have a transgender team??,ABU
michael strahan doesn't believe that shit for a minute he played in the nfl imagine a girl coming in at quarterback he definitely knows it's not fair.,ABU
no shit they have an advantage,NOT
this probably won't get seen but trisha i can relate i've always felt more comfortable around men have always had more male friends than female have always been told i have a strong masculine energy and i've always thought my personality would've been better in a mans body i don't believe these factors make someone transgender they are absolutely real and valid feelings but i think you are still trisha you're just moulding that person into who you think others want her to be you need to be you regardless of what is between your legs❤️,NOT
absolutely they have an advantage they are male athletes running in female races.,ABU
"3:4 .then run with the men then,that way if you lose in your own words itll just push you to run faster also yall would be seen as brave since yall would be different from everybody they dont see how their own logic can be used against them .was she expecting them to say it would be unfair they cant say that even if they thought so otherwise they would be admitting they are in the wrong if they were actual born females they would feel the same way as those girls",ABU
they are girls so let them compete with the girls,NOT
so genderfluid.. also this makes me so angry that this seems like clickbait and ads t has done stuff like this before and i'm all about making mistakes on how you feel it happens and everyone has the right to discover and grow but i don't believe t has grown maturity wise i don't know t's life outside of screen but what's on screen shows a lack of respect maturity growth and shows offensive stupidity and ignorance on who t claims to be or to like or to trust or even to hate misinformation or a lack of information cause t to jump to conclusions fast i respect that you feel this way but i beg you please please please don't capitalize on this and trans people lgbt people and most importantly capitalizing on your own gender identity discovery and journey by putting ad or using it to cover up past issues like vlog squad by making it clickbait making it money making it the same mistakes you've made in the past i beg you to grow i beg you to explare i beg you to not put ads on videos about your transitions physical and mentally i beg you educate yourself and not invalidate anyone i beg you to respect people who have died to be who they identify as fighting for your right to explore who you are i may not like you as a person but i support you exploring who you are and i only want you to please grow and mature.,NOT
wow the animation a :2 is really misleading you represent en wage gap shrinking from  cents to . cents which is not the case it's  cents to . cents you even mention the value later if you want to mock people for their lack of math knowledge at least don't mess up a simple substraction i agree that more statistics knowledge and critical thinking toward statistical studies would be a good thing there's so many possibility to find the wrong answer even when being trying to be honest the choice of college field is also part of the problem as society tend to stir you toward or away from certain field depending on your gender.,NOT
so why do women chose less good paying jobs you have this question first.,NOT
companies are all about profit they will choose the workers with the best quality/quantity cheapness ratio they wouldnt gain anything by preferring anyone from a certain group to anyone from another group of people.,NOT
trisha just looks dirty,NOT
this isn't fair now girls will lose scholarships to boys.,NOT
as far as frappuccinos go i mean they're not healthy but if you want one every once in a while there are vegan options the actual base of all fraps is dairy free whether you're getting a coffee base or cream base or you can swap out the regular base for soy milk if you want you just have to focus on the flavour portion and skip anything with dairy example nothing chocolate and no caramal drizzle and obviously no whipped cream if you get the light version of any frap it automatically contains dairy so frappuccinos you can still get coffee mocha oprah chai espresso green tea strawberries and crème.,NOT
i started a plant based diet in 017 now that i'm a medical doctor i'm sure is the best decision i've made ,NOT
first off tricia you are beautiful no matter who is standing next to you or what the number of the scale says as far as food goes no need to worry about protein all plant foods contain adequate amount of amino acids and as long as you eat a variety of plants you will meet your protein needs worrier any problem the most important thing to remember is to limit as much fat as you can and load up on carbohydrates you'll have to get over your fear of carbs such as pasta breads and potatoes and rice and of course fruit too but that won't be enough calories for you long-term) make your food tasty maybe look up some delicious recipes such as curry stir fry or go on youtube or on freelee's channel also i would highly recommend going to vegan restaurants so you can still enjoy delicious food and not feel deprived.,NOT
her eyes stared into my soul,NOT
in my job as an executive director of a non-profit we pay men and women equally but women end up making less because they take more time off exceeding what we allow which means they aren't paid for it a couple women scream equal pay for equal work but i remind them that also means equal work for equal pay' if they aren't there to work they won't get paid for it unfortunately for women women take time off not only when they are sick but also when family members are sick or when someone in the family has a school consultation or school play or dr's or dentist's appointment one woman in the office would leave every day at :00pm an hour before everyone else because the bus would drop her kids off at school at that time when she complained about me docking her pay for that i explained that why would it be fair for me to pay her that hour when the others in the office were actually working to be paid i had suggested that she not take a lunch or come in early but those didn't work for her either i felt like she was lucky i let her go home early every day she felt like i was robbing her.,NOT

she is a gay man in a women's body  hhhhmmmn yeah lol,NOT
i personally think she really does have identity issues sorry i know issues doesn't sound right but i can't think of the right word i think we need to come at her more gently because it's so clear that trisha has so many different problems and i do believe that she's actually working hard to change herself but there's so much going on and she just wants to belong maybe she's not trans but she's very much confused i don't think she was doing this just for money she is a very confused and damaged person that needs to really focus on herself and people need to cut her some slack,NOT
who the hell is making over 00k one year out of school?,NOT

of course it's unfair haha it's completely ridiculous.,ABU
i've always heard that when switching over to a vegan diet you gain weight before you lose any because your body is getting use to it so if this is to lose weight before a music video maybe now isn't the best time i duno...,NOT
i conceide this point however i will also say that i would rather make slightly less living a life i want to live with the profession major and schedule i am happiest and most able to work than chase dollars my entire life.,NOT
basically trisha paytas is a bossy bitch who is salty that her gay ex isn't attracted to her,ABU
freelee lost all her weight when she was totally raw vegan. she got slim as a raw vegan then mentained her slim body with rt4 but now she is not necessarily doing rt but she is still vegan. no no no you can't eat as much as you want on a vegan diet you will get fat so many people have got fat on rt4 you need to eat less on to lose weight and you have to do cardio you will gain weight if you follow rt4 you need to find a vegan diet that helps you to cut look for a vegan body builder and follow the diet they use for cutting you need some professional help check our jon vegus he is a vegan body builder his girlfriend katherine is a trained nutritionist and does meal plans and coaching for people like your self so go check out there website and their youtube.,NOT

black bean burgers are always great for the summer and got protein eat lots of leafy greens for iron make sure to take a b1 supplement if you go fully vegan because you woulf most likely need it animals are made to eat b1 it comes from the ground so when they are slaughtered its in the meat almond milk or soy milk are the best.,NOT

this issue will never resolve it self family life would have to reshape and women would have to see their time with children or their selves reduce to even out the numbers with men working full or part time women would have to value their time at work as much or more so than their social or family existence and firefighter is never going to be a flexible job for someone who isn't invested fully in it lots of things will never likely bend that much to an employee's needs.,NOT

“if men make more money than women then why don't businesses just hire all women? because that's not how ceos negotiate pay...at all how little a boss pays their employees is based on what they can get away with while negotiating wages there is a reason why employees are discouraged from discussing their salaries with one another it's to keep pay negotiations in favor of the boss and in a hypothetical environment such as an office building with more men in it than women you can get away with paying women a lower salary by making it difficult to compare her earnings with other employees.,NOT

our factors for wage gap in full time work is how many hours worked and occupation choices isn't full time work defined by  hours in most cases and its not peculiar that men's occupations offer more pay i guess all those lawsuits between women and companies over the women getting paid less were just leftist jokes lol hilarious.,NOT

"hi freelee i have been vegetarian since i was eleven years old always with a keen disinterest in the taste of meat i recently decided i would go vegan and began exclusively eating a plant based diet but despite feeling good i found i was losing too much weight i wasn't big to begin with so the weight loss was dramatic i've turned back to dairy and eggs as a dense calorie source but i'd like to continue the transition--though unsure how to expand my stomach enough to accommodate the volume of fruits and veg required to maintain a healthy weight i hoped you could address this in a future video also i struggle slightly with the idea of consuming as many calories as an obese person or person eating for two, and not with the fear of gaining weight but with the knowledge that our planet has limited resources and in . billion if half of us are eating for two wouldn't that seem closer to 0. and a deeper strain on the enviroment any thought you have on this topic would be great thank you )",NOT

the future is fucking vegan ✊✊,NOT
the reason women do almost all of the work of looking after babies is that feminists have brainwashed the world to believe that men are incapable of nurturing and gentleness you won't entertain the possibility that a man has any good characteristics or else feminism would collapse in an instant the other thing feminists refuse to consider is the first thing any man ever does with his pay whenever he gets it he hands it straight to his wife.,NOT
none of this makes you transgender yea being a girl sucks yea toxic masculinity isn't attractive but none of this makes you a boy just because you like gay men doesn't mean you are one i'm sorry i'm not tryna attack or hate or nothing i'm just saying i think she's just a lil confused.,NOT
a few minutes worth of research proves that this video essay is inaccurate.,NOT
sadly i personally know a few women which despite being presented with facts will put their feet down and sustain the rhetoric of the wage gap and the malecentric job market,NOT
obviously fruit and veg is vegan but find substitutes and things you can still eat so it's easier oreos are vegan a lot of chips are vegan it's not healthy but it definitely helps the transition,NOT

women choosing career that requires nurturing compassion is 00 okay it's their choice feminazis should never demonize them just because they chose what they love to do although i will argue that most of these hard working women deserves more i mean example teachers family councilors nurses these women are the people who shape our children who in turn will shape our future they help us a lot to make the families which is the core of our society intact their impact in our society is not as obvious but they do play a big important role in developing it so yes they deserve more maybe not in the same way as doctors or engineers or lawyers because these professions require a lot more technical skills but they do deserve a better standard of living in our society.,NOT
dom raso isn't smart to me,NOT

the reason why women do not choose to work more is because they mostly take care of their children this difference comes from unfair distribution of housechores and child care between wife and husband.,NOT

the best tip i can give you is if you need to eat fast food go to taco bell for the most vegan options just substitute beans for mean and order no cheese or sour cream) or go to wendy's and get a baked potato plain with ketchup packets or whatever you want with it!,NOT
there is a conversation to be had about women made to feel unwomanly if they're not performing feminity.,NOT
i would recommend doing it longer than weeks because the first month is usually the hardest! just eat lots of fruits.. look to pinterest for nummy amazing recipes you can also just look at a recipe and take out dairy and meat and put in nut milk or tofu i am happy for you that you are looking to do this you may fail many times. i definately have! you live in a great city that is plentiful of options you will never be bored 3,NOT

the introduction to this video alone hit me really really fucking hard i was a tomboy as a kid got teased for it and felt a lot of pressure to be hyperfeminine as i got older it took me years to realize that as much as i loved being good at being feminine* i didn't like how i looked literally everything you're saying about penis envy about how i felt a struggle between wanting to be a good feminist or a better stronger woman and this nagging idea that i was actually a guy it felt like a betrayal for me to give up my identity as a woman but now that i'm three and a half years on testosterone i know that my body is meant to have t in it kicking gender norms to the curb and escaping the conforms of what society tells you that you have to be being a gender nonconforming man choosing to forgo hormones or getting hormones and surgery all of those are perfectly reasonable you don't have to go hypermasculine to be a gay trans man hell you could date other gay trans men but at any rate you're absolutely welcome here you're not faking being trans. there's no correct way to be trans!!!,NOT

if you keep eating unlimited calories you'll gain weight until your body heals and i think it'd take a lot of time since you have messed up your metabolism so you're probably gonna gain weight instead of losing it the weight loss in this diet lasts some time its not done after a week,NOT

i am a straight female and have never understood the trans community but you seem so intelligent and normal i would be friends with you maybe trishas video will lead ppl to educate themselves and understand trans people better.,NOT
250k of 00k is 2.5 so it's 7.5 less and not 0 less should be something like while women were earning 0 of what men does no 0 less leaves 0%.,NOT
in communism everyone shares a common wealth,NOT
rice pasta quinoa,NOT
the incredible thing about this video is that it promotes making hours more flexible to accomodate mothers needs but never questions the basic premise that it is up to women to take hours away from work to look after the kids i'm deeply disappointed vox.. furthermore why does your only solution seem to be in the increasing liberalization and deregulation of businesses like pharmacies is this really the only way forward ,NOT
you're just bored at this point girl.,NOT

"there would be more reasons why the top five majors have more men than women is it the stereotype of men and women that contributes to this result we need to put away the stereotypes and encourage women and men to develop themselves in a diversified way when can we really stop saying choose a stable job and stay in the family you don't have to be ambitous,,blablabla""to women and somehow deters them from realizing more possiblities?",NOT

mmmmmm meat i fucking love it,NOT
women wakeup the want to replace you,ABU
the truth will always win it's just a matter of time thanks to all activists accelerating this positive change in the world!,NOT
the wage gap only happens because men work more dangerous jobs get jobs that are more successful such as engineering while woman are more likely to work in fashion also men work more overtime than women.,ABU

men are also more likely to ask for raises and work longer shifts,NOT
i'm so proud of you!! but as a vegan you need to eat carbohydrates rice potatoes chickpeas beans exc also don't think that a vegan diet is just fruit eat enough calories and have fun ♥,NOT
those videos affected you and that's why people should watch them once because they are horrifying but that's the only way people can really see what happens being blind to the facts is just ignorance i'm really glad you're trying to become veg and i really hope you can make it i'm vegetarian since i was 3yo and it's the best decision i've ever made besides there are so many veg foods that really taste like the meat ones my family eats meat and they still prefere the veg ones because are just so good i won't tell the name just because i'm in italy and i'm sure they won't sell this brand in usa but you just have to find the right ones) have a great day everyone d,NOT

hey trisha i support you and will be by your side people shouldn't get mad at you just because your confused i understand how it feels to be lost look i honestly feel like the only gay guy who's on your side what i realized about these gays that get offended they act like they're going through way more just because they get offended easily well i'm sorry they can't understand you for you i'm sorry they make thousands of sexuality's just to make gay go viral sorry our world fucked you up in so many ways you can't even find yourself i know how that feels trisha i'm on your side and im gay so what are they gonna do about it ,NOT
20:5 wild squirrel factory farming is getting worse and worse we need to take action now go vegan especially don't ever support grey squirrel consuming we wouldn't want the red squirrel to get back speaking of species extinction damn these people know how to twist things.. it's hard to believe unfortunately many do i used to too veganism is not the answer.,NOT
youtube is suggesting that the next video i watch is called there is no gender wage gap from prageru which implies that this is the type of video watched by many who watched this one that's interesting because this video provides a nuanced understanding of the gap based on research while i'm fairly certain prageru based on many of their other vidoes does not of course if there was no gap there would be at least some industries in which men are underpaid which do not currently exist hats off to vox for making the argument of those crazies in a non-crazy rational manner.,NOT
i think what trisha is dealing with is gender expression and not gender identity,NOT
im so excited and i bet freele must be over heels now,NOT
that was one of trishas best troll video ever.,NOT
what happened to your instagram i can't find it?,NOT
there's an app called is it vegan and you can scan bar codes and it'll tell you all the ingredients and obviously if it's vegan,NOT

wasn't this filmed a few weeks ago though?,NOT
"can you give me the link to the video farm to fridge""?",NOT
i might just be the only person to not leave a hate comment bc i feel the exact way that you do i just dont identify as trans bc im too scared to confront the feelings fuck yall for being mean if someone feels a certain way they're allowed to talk about it and identify in a way that feels right to them which is what labels were made for also its just a label and we are all humans trying to figure out wtf is going on in our brains but nah yall just bullies if you have an actual constructive thing to say feel free to reply otherwise dont waste your time bc i dont care and dont want to read dumb ass hate messages,NOT
this doesn't surprise me just irritates me because she's already hit rock bottom when it comes to mental health now she's just being toxic ,ABU
i identify as a billionaire!,NOT
so in short the wage gap is produced not by discrimination but by the choices that women make.,NOT
just get short hair thats all,NOT
beans and avocado instead of meat in a wrap,NOT
love you you're a huge inspiration the impact you've made on so many people's lives is unreal,NOT
one huge thing that the video missed was that women take off time from work when they have children in some cases women take off as much as or years from their career studies show women end up going back into different career fields or different companies and basically starting all over after having a child what must that do to their professional development and potential to earn any feminist who demands a woman get paid the same as a man after she is taking years off of professional development and work is being extremely sexist themselves if you work harder and longer you deserve more!,NOT
marinated tofu on qeonua and brown rice with broccoli and cauliflower mm yum,NOT
men get paid more than women because men are more likely to get maimed killed do filthy or degrading jobs or work long hours than women its a fact i am a garbage man its filthy degrading and hard work but it pays good can women do it sure of course but you never do i wonder why?,NOT
how come they never provide examples of men and women working for the same company doing the same work and for the same amount of hours being paid differently.,NOT
wouldn't that be a salary gap then?,NOT
fuck this is disturbing kick them the hell out.,ABU
i'm vegan for over years got rid of my acne gained 20kg of muscle mass and created my dream reality never felt better ,NOT
this is such horseshit clearly her glam and outfit tell this video is old and she's constantly posting vlogs about eating non vegan things and in her cook with me grocery haul on her vlog channel she references piggies sizzling and she's cooking bacon and apologizes to all the vegans and says she tried to go vegan for a hot minute this video is clearly the hot minute) it's fucking pathetic she would even upload this knowing she didn't stick with it.,ABU
heeeeerrrrrressss the triggered.............,NOT
vegetarian going vegan here - but the beyond meat burgers reek ugh must be the pea protein but my house smells so awful when i have cooked them the smell kills me they taste ok impossible a little better have not cooked them at home though so we'll see) i make my own black bean with oats burgers they don't smell bad.,NOT

"the earnings gap calculation suffers from survivor bias men are more willing to take on responsibility and more demanding roles some of them do well from this and others end up out of their depth and get fired the ones who get fired aren't included in the average any more but the ones who do well are included this artificially skews the average towards men here's the math let's say we start with 0 men and 0 women each on 5k per year the average salary is 5k a year for both men and women then  men and women move to 40k roles women do well get fired  men do well get fired presuming same success rate between men and women total number of women remaining in the sample  total women's salary  35k 5 plus 40k 3.44 million average woman's salary 35,153.0 total number of men remaining in the sample  total men's salary  35k plus  40k 3,28 million average man's salary 35,652.1 so the average man's salary ends up 50 higher just from this one factor survivor bias*.",NOT
this is very funny,NOT
i posted this video as a comment on a facebook news post about the wage gap and i got locked out of my account for weeks,NOT
or!!!...or!...or we could start training young men and boys to start picking up their share of the child care and chores why does it have to be the woman's job if men are equal to women then they need to man up and start acting like half their dna is in this child if men were able to say rearrange their tues and thurs schedules to make sure they were the ones to pick up the kids from school and take them to soccer practice and make dinner then the woman would only have to rearrange mon wed fri not to mention that if men were also held responsible for 0 of the care then businesses would have to start having more family friendly programs and hours because both fathers and mothers around 0 of the work force would be working around their babies just a thought.,NOT

just bc you're attracted to gay guys doesn't make you a gay man what....,NOT
i'll often wonder if this chick trisha is just a really good actress and thinks of ways to troll youtube and i think that this is not the issue to be trolling about.,NOT
i hope she doesn't but i feel like she will give up if she doesn't see progression there won't be any progression because there is so much fat between organs she wont see any progression because all her efforts will first burn the fat that she cant see then her stomach fat will burn and that's why i cant see her going through with this because she wont see sudden progression.,NOT
that's pretty incredible considering the tense relationship the two had a few months prior to their face-to-face meet up regardless of her true intentions the attempt speaks volumes.,NOT
rather than developing a interesting and fair debate on how we look at gender pay gap reports all this video does is reduce the issue to flawed simplistic arguements that suit a certain demographic of people... while the arguement that the way gender pay is calculated may be too simplistic could be a valid this video abandons any hope of a nuanced debate by peddling the notion that most pay gap issues we see is due to the choice of women that will please all the anti-feminists that believe women are trying to take their rights away not sure how youtube's algorithm landed this video inside my echo chamber probably missclicked on too many man on motorbike fights cop videos.,NOT
i am so happy to hear this i've been a fan of yours for a long time and i'm also vegan i think you'll love being vegan the benefits are amazing some vegan foods i like are gardein meat cocoroons svelte protein shakes and banana nicecream good luck trisha love you💕,NOT

it has to do with life choice its not les per hr its less per year ie less work put in per year,NOT
"the title is so misleading though you concede in the video that there is actually a gender pay gap you still opted to title the video in a way that explicitly suggests that there's no wage gap what a way to deceptively push your narrative as for reasoning that no one knows for sure why there's a pay gap perhaps you should've brought up the various studies in one of which they handed out fictitious resumes with the only difference being that one was named john a boy name whilst the other was named jennifer a girl name) it found that not only was the man rated more favorably but that he was offered 4,00 more than the female candidate i don't know about you but i believe that's gender discrimination right there.",NOT

i can't tell if this video is a joke or not. not hating.just genuinely wondering.,NOT
"wages and earnings are not the same thing men and women have the same wages there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap because men do make more money only because they choose to do more difficult jobs and do more overtime and work more hours and take less breaks/days off and ask for raises more often women don't make as much money because they are not hard workers it has nothing to do with muh patriarchy""",NOT

let's be perfectly honest it's got nothing to do with fairness or even economics it's all about power and these feminist groups want that power if they could push themselves into the right seats they could effectively start deciding who would get certain benefits and life styles while others would regulated to ostracation this is communist manifesto 01.,NOT

i don't care that women make less then men men have better jobs that's why they make more and now women make more this video sucks it's all false and men should be making more because they try harder while women just cheat on the man that's why they make so much i really don't care about your stupid little oh we need money ehh no you don't y'all make less cause you don't have as good jobs idiot this was a horrible video,ABU
i don't recommend using headphones for this video the audio completely broke lol but the video makes up for it 👏,NOT
i'm all for eating more plants but i don't think we should force people to stop eating meat if we are worried about methane check out taronis technologies they have the solutions to all of the climate arguments and they are talking to the governments around the world including our own we don't need extreme ideas just need to use our brains and create technology we need more co to make plants grow faster and bigger with our population increasing i don't think reducing the co is the answer but i would agree that we need to find cleaner ways to use the fuels we have taronis technology even adds oxygen to the atmosphere and i'm not sure that electric cars are going to make our world cleaner when the majority of our electricity comes from coal gas and petroleum we need clean technologies i do think that educating people on plant based diets is a good thing most will see the benefits if they are willing to try it.,NOT
i saw this as a ad and it was so great i watched the full min ad,NOT
1:4 good example for the whole vegan community and how vegans dont have to sell you anything.,NOT
i love how feminists like to complain about the supposed wage gap but are completely silent to the fact that women as a demographic take more money from the government than they give in taxes in short women pay no taxes and get additional money while men have to carry the entire system and get much less than that.,ABU
"16,00 triggered feminists",NOT
vox would never make a video like this in 01 they're really far left now),NOT
i can just see it now disliked unsubbed this doesn't support my feminist agenda this is bullshit. good video vox.,NOT
rice with beans is a good source of protein potatoes and pasta are really good to and dried fruits are delicious,NOT
you have very similiar voice which is very confusing,NOT
you okay sis?,NOT
im sorry trish but you can't achieve freelee's look in weeks it took her years i feel like you should take this idea for longer than two weeks.,NOT
so in other words if men do more chores women will have more time in work then she'll get paid more.,NOT
for some reason when i saw this video i automatically thought the tittle was why i'm not going vegan lmao,NOT
i don´t think i have ever ever been more confused by a video,NOT
carbs girl make sure you eat lots of carbs pasta rice etc it's super filling and being full being happy it also keeps your cravings for animal products down i also swear by smoothies with things like dates nuts etc those are all great sources of protein as well i've been vegan for years and its the best decision i've ever made go girl!,NOT
yup... unfair advantage testosterone and thousands of years be faster stronger than women,NOT
we live in the political correctness era why don't these women sue these companies for gender discrimination?,NOT
where i come from we don't have this problem cause our society is built on families rather than on individuals you live with your parents and contribute in the house money but still everyone has his own money and own property you leave your parents house when you are ready to start your own family and both partners contribute in the house money and it is the same for men and women,NOT
what it is your creepy obsession?,NOT
goodluck girl!!! eat as much food as you please and feel amazing!!! hopefully you will stick to it in about to be 2months!!!,NOT

hope that every sexist or feminists can finally use their brains or common sense after watching this,NOT
this video was really well explained and informative it shows that the wage gap is real but not for the stereotypical reasons that are being put out,NOT
wait so if she says that somedays she's a girl and somedays she's a boy isn't that genderfluid please correct me if i'm wrong),NOT
this is a huge slap in the face to all the people that say freely is to abrasive and not effective we need all different kinds of vegan activists to bring more people to the lifestyle i've been vegan since may 2 01 because of youtubers like freely i never heard about veganism before watching freely.,NOT
well then its up to personal responsibility inb culture makes them less consistant in the work force talk to your man.,NOT
i am a feminist and agree with this video we are not all insane😂,NOT
trisha gets breast implants lip fillers a bunch of cosmetic surgery also trisha i'm a trans man.,NOT
this is why america needs both maternity leave and paternity leave.,NOT
so you are pointing out how our culture teaches women that they can't or shouldn't be in technical majors and careers or leadership roles this is what leads to a lower median salary for women so we should work harder to let women know that are just as capable of engineering and technical work instead of pushing them out of these historically male dominated fields.,NOT
i'm so sorry but just genetically and physically not fair,NOT
going vegan is not about going to a fast food restaurant and eating something that kinda sorta looks like meat it's about cooking and eating plant based foods in your home i love the concept of the impossible burger or other fake meats but some are just as unhealthy as a lot of the other crap out there i get it means we're not eating animals but i have a couple friends that are living off fake meat and now claiming that veganism isn't helping w weight loss and other benefits of veganism because they're still eating like crap.,NOT
guy's this video is true to a point please watch the vlogbrothers they are more specific and are probably true just watch all the perspective.,NOT

u have to take it slow hunny u eat chips and go out too much so how are u jumping imto it so fast trish,NOT
what about the fact that the woman dominated fields have men as the top bosses does that show anything?,NOT
no more cum then,NOT
it's illegal to pay people differently for the same work if there is a wage difference how come there isn't lots of legal action being taken perhaps they wouldn't stand up in court,NOT
check out they have bomb vegan recipies!!,NOT
i cant get over how pretty blaire looks in this video,NOT
the wage gap is real but it's only like -8% and it hasn't been proven to be an act of discrimination.,NOT
they use the word brave tooooo loosely,NOT
trish one thing that could help your new vegan lifestyle could be going on walks i know one thing is i joined a cross country team in th grade i used to run a  min mile but now i run a  min mile walking is a great step to running running has so so so many good things about it anybody can do it no matter the size cause i know i wasnt the skinniest in cross country it can also improve your mood and lastly it is a very effective way to be healthy i know that if you do want to work on this and be able to continue it you have to start slow and be patient i know that i never was near the front even when i was improved but that doesnt matter what matters is that your time improved if you do want to start this activity i recommend first walking maybe half a mile every day for about days then you try to run/jog a full mile i remember running my mile for the first time i would stop every mins probably one way to gain back energy but not stop and take a rest is just by slowing down even if you have to walk to gain energy back your still going somewhere and continuing anyway if you do want to do this practice walking then you need to try your hardest to run/jog a mile when doing the mile you need to have a timer going when you are done with your mile and have your mile time write it down somewhere you will always see it and then when you go on more runs you can easily figure out how fast you've gotten how long it would probably be to go an extra distance i also recomenned getting a certain type watch fitbit orsomething like it or getting a app on your phone one thing that gets me motivated to run is getting new running gear i recommend not ordering online the prettiest one by a over the top brand but instead find a local running gear store near you and get you walk checked and feet checked to find the perfect shoe for your feet that will help so much i hope you get to see this advice love you! blndsundoll4mj,NOT
didn't this video just prove the wage gap doesn't exist by proving that kids are the reasons why there is a gap if men took care of kids more wouldn't the gap shift to men or better yet just not have any kids and eliminate the gap?,NOT

i honestly don't care because i ain't about to give my salary away the same i don't expect them.,NOT
there is nothing wrong with traditional gender roles where the husband is responsible for providing and the wife is responsible for caring millennia of history and simple biology tells us that is a strong and efficient default family structure that has kept our species alive this long if that's what a couple wants that shouldn't be a topic for a feminist's protest sign just because raising children doesn't get you a paycheck money is not the most important thing in the world even though many people think so on the flip side i do also believe that if both husband and wife want to break from tradition/biology and are both providing then both husband and wife should be caring as well it's all about a balance and the on each side is not what it's all about it's about a happy and functioning home with what the people inside that home consider an egalitarian division of responsibilities regardless of a wage gap. people would do well to establish this before deciding to marry and/or have kids so they don't just let life happen to them and become unhappy in their home and channel their discontent into an internal hatred of whatever system or movement they think is keeping them down smart choices planning your life and personal responsibility will do wonders.,NOT
blaire always setting this shit straight much love!,NOT
one of the only decent vox videos,NOT
yes trish!! this is exactly what you need for a healthy body and mind! you really need to stick with it to get great results but in the end it is worth it 00% make sure you're eating until you're completely satisfied and full so proud of you trish this is a great step in the right direction ),NOT

try making noodle stir fry's rice pasta with tomato-based sauces and other carby things because to maintain a fully raw all fruit and veggie diet you have to eat sooo much to start off you should try eating meals like the above to transition so it doesn't feel like a shock if you go cold-turkey raw i guarantee you won't stay vegan ),NOT
-smoothies/smoothie bowls are so so easy yummy tip add spinach to get in some greens in if you add ripe banana it masks the spinach taste frozen fruit in bulk freeze spotty ripe bananas for smoothies oatmeal with some cut up dried fruit dates fruits. so good plant based milk almond milk hazelnut milk are my favorite but there are so many out there it comes in handy with teas cereal cooking. lentil pasta don't knock it till u try it potatoes! remember to eat enough if you're eating whole foods you can just eat till you're satisfied and not worry about restricting. b/c it's good for you listen to your body! good luck so happy to hear you're trying this out documentaries cowspiracy forks over knives  earthlings the only graphic one out of these is the last one but so eye opening) 💕💕💕💕💕💕 you can do it,NOT
so we have at least 5000 suicidal mental nut jobs running around american high schools? bring back state run mental hospitals and the 15 hold the fear of being declared a mental nut job and being held in a psych ward for  hours would prevent most of these attention whores from being like this.,ABU

a lot of women get paid less than men bc they're willing to work for less and they sometimes work fewer hours to take care of their kids or something now that's not a problem at all but it's true,NOT
the best way to transition is by purchasing all fake animal products at the beginning then slowly transitioning into the starch solution,NOT
ok trisha is literally so dumb,NOT
can you please react to nicole williams peta campaign,NOT
maybe women choose different life choices because men and women are different on average not because of sexism which is what the wage gap myth/argument implies maybe women want to parent and care for the household more than men in general and men want to got out into the world and bring home sustainance more than women in general why should anyone care about closing the wage gap when their is merely a difference in choices not a difference in opportunities infact women are currently given far more opportunities than men and women overall still choose differently than how wage gap apologists want them to.,NOT
are you nippling me fucking finally,NOT
cool someone who supports the wage gap idea but actually gives reasoning for it aside from men are terrible and nasty. i'm on your side vox,NOT

i love this video i just wish the comment section could be as objective and intelligent than just toxic and hateful you can consume knowledge and understand those who you strongly disagree with without completely becoming assholes but assholes love to live in comment sections cause they're unable to do anything really to help make things better other than yell insults and raise their own stress levels and overall make the internet an assholish place.,NOT
did i just waste  minutes of my life watching this yes did i laugh the whole time also yes,NOT
educate yourself eat enough calories and stock up on staples like rice potatoes beans oats etc and if you accidentally eat something not vegan it's no big deal you already did it just stop if you figured out its not vegan and continue on with life just continue to vegan veganism may seem hard at first but after you've done it for a while it becomes more than a diet and just a way of life... good luck on your vegan journey!,NOT

i mean with the system that we have it's impossible to ever get to a discussion about the wage gap i'm not a woman i don't know what it's like in the workplace as a woman i'm still a student i haven't even worked before if you go on the internet and look for studies you will find what satisfies your agenda but you won't necessarily find things that accurately show the practical lives of women in the workplace unless you actually go through women to women telling everyone that they are experiencing all sorts of discrimination which are relatively unique to women men have their own problems they're treated awfully in dangerous work they don't even get the proper care they need when injured they work longer hours and are even pressured at times to do so to the point where they want to do so a system in place to ensure that both men and women are paid the same for the same positions of the same jobs with the same level of commitment should be in place everywhere and there is really no denying that i couldn't care less about labels such as feminists or mens rights activists i care about the truth whether or not it challenges my own deeply held beliefs it's really hard to face them but you have to do it or others and yourself will suffer.,NOT

"how is this so hard for the public to realize there is no wage gap nobody in there right mind would pay others less or more based on their gender the only gap would be based on there physical and or mental capabilities but there is no gap in reality it is a factor on a few different things that cause the wage gap"" it is the fact that women end up not choosing fields that earn them as much for an obvious example there are many more male doctors than female and on the other side there are many more female nurses than male nurses they both are in the same field but there is a clear difference on what they end up choosing also if you ask a lot of girls on what they want to be ones that choose medical fields end up saying i want to be a nurse much more than i want to be a doctor"" that is the equivalent of somebody saying that they want to be a co-pilot maybe that comparison was different but there is an obvious correlation in all fields with this just like you will see a lot more hostess at restaurant than hosts female hostess) another besides that is the effort it would take for females to do certain tasks such as heavy lifting ones or dirty ones clearly men go into that field because they are genetically by far better and they would need or more women to complete a task than man for most cases i can go on with a lot of details but the last would be things like maternity leave causing them to literally miss work for months because they had a child which is understandable but if you want that to be on your options you need to take less pay or you just don't get paid leave.",NOT

"wow they actually halfway explained the facts instead of just blaming it on sexism they did leave out that during this time one of the major reasons that the responsibilities with children were so unequally distributed was because this was a time when about half of marriages ended in divorce and fathers rights were being trampled on by the courts and fathers were expected to pay child support and alimony out the ass while having little to no interaction with their kids so of course if your husband is giving you a check your not going to work as much as the man that has to pay that check things have gotten better with fathers rights now due to men who fought for them with angry feminists battling them the entire way but hey this is a big improvement over five years ago when this video would've been the wage gap exists because i'm a victim and i'm a woman so if you try to prove me wrong with facts you're sexist.""",NOT

personally the video doesn't impact me i know who i am the main issue that i feel a lot of us have especially transguys like myself is that this video will open up a whole bunch of more issues the video could promote more people assuming that they are perfectly okay with being their biological sex feeling that they are trans because they feel masculine at times and unfortunately this could lead people to transitioning then regretting it all of that aside i'm sorry if my english is awful blaire you are just amazing and i love your videos drinking vodka should be you're intro😂❤,NOT

trish paytas is a prime example of how a weak-minded moron can be convinced of extremely high end bullshit easily in the future this sort of shit is going to be considered an alternate form of munchausen's syndrome the only barrier to it now is that these stunning and brave gag! morons...uhhh individuals are getting mainstream acceptance and the thing about that is it really isn't helping them any in fact it's doing the opposite if someone wants to know how this works it is entirely possible for a parent to hate their child and at the same time smother them with appears to be love at the same time how does it happen shelter them from life don't let them grow up when a parent loves their child as if that child is their possession like an inanimate object that's going through the motions of love and doing bad things to their child in order to keep that child how they want that child to be to an unhealthy extreme or... your child is unhappy and they tell you they just don't want to live anymore and you hand them the gun because it's what they want after all i would argue that a hovering parent or a helicopter parent can actually be worse than a lackadaisical parent neither parent is giving their children direction in a proper fashion on one hand you have children who have no supervision no leadership and and direction leading that kid to seek other people for direction more often than not we're talking the wrong kinds of influences here... and to tell the truth most of them are the exact same way... no parents being a parent on some level they know what they are doing is wrong or bad for them but that doesn't stop them from becoming psychopaths sociopaths drug addicts thieves gang members or any number of other types of criminals out there with a hovering parent the child is clearly in control and it's the parents job to make sure nothing bad happens.while this may generate fewer bad seeds in number these little fuckers are far worse than the other side because these little shits have their parents to cover their six when they start fucking up they have a mandate to be assholes and never have to deal with the consequences because the parents keep those little fuckers from ever experiencing consequences so their bad behavior starkly overshadows all but the worst of the children raised in lackadaisical environments.,ABU

being vegan is actually quite easy and you can still eat amazing foods lots of pastas and rice and potatoes french fries you can still eat out and eat lots of great food for protein beans and quinoa and seeds etc its actually much easier and you can eat much more than you think. and a vegan diet definitely won't make you loose weight unless you diet. believe me i'll eat black bean burgers with asparagus and garlic mushroom pasta with vegan pesto potatoes fries rice and beans.. etc if you want to lose weight diet if you want to be healthy gp vegan,NOT
good job as always christina!,NOT
my teacher was like there is a gender wage gap point black period women get payed less for the same job and im just like wtf how if everyone gets payed the same wage per hour the only way thats true is if women work less hours and thats nobodies fault.,NOT
this woman states the obvious and vomits statistics on you to back her superficial opinion or maybe she's just trying to have you ignore the facts by hiding them in plain sight.,NOT
just my opinion but it sounds like you're non binary not trans a trans man i would think is strictly masculine and you say you like to be girly some days and masculine the next i could be wrong not trying to anger anyone so correct me if i'm wrong but it doesn't sound like your trans but more non binary.,NOT

women sport is dead ,NOT
wait did she say she's a gay man?,NOT
i personally think that a good portion of the actual wage gap comes from men being more aggressive when it comes to requesting raises and are willing to over compensate when wanting the raise my wife for one was fine with just being a crew member i encouraged her to work harder and show her employers that she is worth more than what they are paying her within months she was offered shift lead and i continued to boost her confidence and pushed her to stay on top of things giving her advice on how to prove herself she pushed and worked harder she out shined most of her co workers with in a year she was made management i helped her develop the tools needed to excel and succeed in the job she liked i encourage her and stand behind her whenever she feels that she isn't doing good enough and help her reach the stars because she means so much to me and i can see that her success makes her happy she never would have accomplished so much with out a man's outlook to guide her not saying she would have eventually gotten the position on her own but she would have taken much much longer the way she was handling it she is strong without me but she is even stronger with me we are partners and she outshines me now and i am so proud of her.,NOT

hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha america is too funny,NOT
hey trish! some of my fave vegan foods are vegan brownies you can either get the recipe on google or you can buy them in stores sometimes bean curd/tofu try the marinated tofu or you can get awesome chinese meals with bean curd often sweet chilli/sweet and sour sauce try spicy bean burgers too they're filling and imo taste better than some fake meat options i also love vegan bacon but i've been veggie for a long time so it might take a while for you to adjust to overall try meals filled with rice cous cous or quinoa they keep you full and incorporate lots of flavours into your diet like soy chilli etc) i'm definitely not an expert but i've been veggie my whole life so hopefully you might find one of these ideas interesting love you mama trish   ps sorry for all the parenthesis in this comment lmao),NOT

how did it even come to this living in clown world here all the girls on the team must be so frustrated why participate when you know you have no chance of winning because boys are allowed to come in and compete in what is supposed to be a girls only sport.,ABU
i don't think that wage and earnings should be conflated to the degree that discussion on this issue has caused.,NOT
they are boys all their dna is male no matter what!!!!!! they probably were just average in their tract so now they want to claim they are women so they can go into girls sports yahuah my ab and most high al alyun will judge this nation harshly for allowing homosexuality to run rampant.,ABU
broccoli is good and try a thing called vegan soul it's in mariano's it has very good lasagna it taste like it has real meat though it doesn't,NOT
very good arguments but when i first heard this myth i did my own research and found that there is a different sized wage gap for every single job out there and that something like 9 of those is where women are the bigger earners so i think my arguments deviate somewhat from sommers's arguments but they still argue against the same lie.,NOT
this reminds me of when my older brother thought he would be good at wrestling because he could beat up on his younger brother in essence these people need to compete with someone their own size.,NOT
i had to come back to this video to re strengthen my sanity after having my civics/history teacher brainwash my whole class about this,NOT

i can already feel the backlash of this video-,NOT
what the fuuucccck trisha,ABU
what vox is really trying to tell is that women should get more than their male counterparts even if they are in the office or not whether they leave the office early or not present when clients need them instead they should be paid for staying home.fantastic thinking vox.,NOT

there is something very wrong with you.,NOT
how the care is divided up can be boiled down to instinct men often increase their work hours while women often decrease their hours of work this is something that no amount of social pressure of political activism could ever change this is because there are biological reactions that women have to rearing children even years after they're born specifically one that happens for most of a child's infancy is lactation breast feeding isn't something you can do and work at the same time even if your work is from home on a computer and it's something that only women can do one of the things about the early physical reactions to kids that women have is that they create habits in the time that the mother can't work due to recovering from pregnancy and and a cocktail of chemicals that the brain releases resulting in women not even wanting to be away from their child for minuets the father assuming that they're still in the picture has increased his hour of work in an attempt to ensure that the family is well provided for putting his boss in the habit of expecting him to continue to go above and beyond which pretty much locks his situation unless he's willing to loose his job in which event the family would fall apart due to financial struggles so he's not going to risk that and since his hands are tied by the time the mother is capable of entering the work force again she ends up having to take a more lenient job with time at work which often pay less than the jobs where your lack of presence could cost the company money in which case you'd be fired so that she can remain on all in case of an emergency with the kids during early child care it's not possible to divide up the work evenly and later during child care people are prone to habit and often don't bother trying to fix what isn't broken.,NOT
"sorry sweetheart but if you don't work the same you're not getting payed the same this isn't a problem to be fixed"" and the workplace doesn't need to accommodate people who are less work-oriented.",NOT
you have to be a male dressed as a woman because this is a lie the wage gap is true men have oppressed women for way too long it's time for women to revolt this injustice,NOT

wow be careful with all the statistics and factual numbers. facts might hurt someone's feelings...,NOT
im vegan and ive got a couple of things to say about this nothing negative i promise first off i think what you said about if freelee would be nice in her youtube videos if she would people wouldnt watch when she does shocking things people do watch there are sooooo many vegan youtubers out there that are nice but none of them are as popular as freelee second what you do need to realise is that having a vegan diet wont magically make you lose weight the only thing is that vegan things are generally less dense in calories although they do fill you up thats why when people go vegan they will lose some weight in the first few weeks but then when your body starts craving those calories you will stop losing weight unless you obviously go high carb low fat like freelee because thats just a really good way to lose weight slowly and healthily and third i would recommend eating lots of fruit and not too much other food for now for these two weeks to lose weight quickly for the video but if you want to stick with it you should definitely eat more rice potatoes beans legumes bread and meat replacers since they are the things that will fill you up most and they will have enough calories to keep you going if you eat too little calories you will feel horrible and blame veganism although really youre just not eating enough and then last my favorite thing about veganism and i think yours too is you get to eat so much more even with processed food vegan things tend to have less calories so you get to eat more without having more calories i hope you'll make the right choice after these two weeks the right choice for your own health for the animals and for the planet if you want to educate yourself further i would recommend watching cowspiracy and earthlings although earthlings only shows animal abuse as where cowspiracy shows more environmental issues).,NOT
20:2 there is a word i want to use here but youtube for some ungodly reason seems to continually target me when i use this word and delete my comments when this word is used and it's the c word these people are damn stupid inhuman cs of the highest order you can decide to push back but i hope to god that we'll push back again even fucking harder still alright quite fucking thinking we can be intimidated because we are not shoving dead animals in our faces left right and center you damn heartless devils people when you get this shit thrown at you you must fight that much harder you must help these neanderthal dinosaurs realize that we can't and won't be pushed around or intimidated any longer ok please these bastards are no more right than we are and we cannot allow them to go around thinking they are any longer we simply can't my best be well be safe out.,NOT
what's your problem with feminists we just want justice loved the video tho,NOT
i fucking hate ur title you can't tell her what she is it's confusing and there's little backstory and little reason but you don't know her and you don't know how her mind works or how she feels or even how she really acts it's discrediting to think that she's being kinda cancelled for opening up wether it's believable or not people identify as fucking anything they want leave her be,NOT
freelee's big smiles throughout the video ),NOT
go compete with the boys as a transgender you have a penis!! not a vagina you are genetically a boy you can identify as anything you want but you still have a penis male hormones male muscles i say.... private christian school.,ABU

hmmm this woman is going on a diet because she is under pressure to look a certain way for music videos she's only eating fruit because she thinks it will help her having to look a certain way for the music media bosses she isn't doing it to be healthy she's doing it to be exploited and promote eating disorders it's sad to see girls under so much pressure to be skinny this is not an advert for veganism an advert for veganism is to eat for health concern and even for an ideology to promote tolerance and peace not to eat to be exploited and forced to look borderline anorexic shame be well trisha.,NOT
naturally sefanie is a british vegan youtuber who does a tonne of vegan videos which could help you out i highly recommend you check her out she's scottish and just incredible good luck girl i want to be vegan but find it so hard to transition into one keep us updated!x,NOT
so what is there to hate about this video? why would you unlike it? these are facts,NOT
the kid factor is a large part of it in fact it is worth separating women with kids and women without kids in terms of the wage gap.,NOT

"this isn't enough proof to say that there isn't a wage gap,but there also isn't proof to say there is a wage gap between genders there are also other factors like the proportion of boy and girls a college accepts this isn't always   on both sides either at this point both sides are dumb.",NOT
wage gap is false and invalid if it really existed then employers would employ women wouldn't they?,NOT
seriously considering going vegan because of you freelee thank you.,NOT
i feel like she's trying to apply gender fluidity to transgender,NOT
no way she could be vegan because of cinnabon delights.,NOT
whom ever governs these sports should not allow this unfair advantage for the born male transgender people.,ABU
i hate when femenist bring this up as a fact just ask them how that would even be a thing if the constitution states it'd be illegal and why don't companies hire way more girls if they're cheaper?,NOT
"you need to invest in a sociology book or even dabble in a little bit of phycology vox invest in some real research woman don't tend to spend over years in college but males do there is no wage gap"" just an intelligent gap by the way your wage gap on the business end is way off how many females own a business compared to males?blame it on having babies close your dam legs!",ABU

ok but you mentioned how the 7 to statistic is just average salary and you said how women might typically take lesser paying jobs but you never specifically tied the two together,NOT
omfg the first sentence is the logic i always use i would rather hire all females if i can pay them lower.,NOT

your instagram link isn't working,NOT
its amazing to see so many people who feel that the best thing they ever done is going vegan i feel exactly the same i love to go to the shop as see my favorite vegan products sold out! d,NOT
if a woman you know is earning less than a man for the exact same job you should call a lawyer women have equal opportunity in modernised countries which means that they are free to pursue the same careers that men do the fact that less women choose to do this is where the wage gap comes from it's a result of a personal decision from a woman and if it's problem then more women should be transferring to the higher risk jobs that men dominate through fair process not discrimination and closing that gap we don't need to look into the wage gap because there is no difference in women's earning for the same job there is no discrimination in this gap between incomes and therefore it isn't an issue this isn't a feminist argument this is a study of the choices women make and they make those choices not because of some form of oppression or patriarchy but because they have the freedom to choose their job and less women choose high risk high paying jobs it doesn't prove anything other than that i'm not saying people can't research it it's quite interesting to observe human choices but i'm saying that this can never be used to advocate a feminist issue because the way it is misrepresented over and over again makes it sound like one and anyone who uses it as such is either intellectually dishonest or retarded.,NOT
trisha is the newest 01 transtrender.,NOT
it is an unfair advantage biology still makes them stronger than the natural born girls period.,ABU
i'm vegitarian an will hopefully go vegan in the future cooking is a nessacity trish you gotta start cookin more and whipping up some delish veggies! ),NOT
girl go try the veggie grill! they're all over la and the food is bomb af i was obsessed with chicken too and the veggie grill santa fey crispy chicken sandwich got me over it because it tastes exactly like chicken everything at the veggie grill is vegan including their chocolate shakes and cookies) i'm soo happy you're going vegan good luck and like everyone else said be careful not to overeat because a lot of people tend to when going vegan keep in mind that freelee rides her bike for at least  miles every day and that's about 00 calories burned so she can afford to eat a huge bowl of pasta every night i stick to rice veggies fruit and some beans for weightloss also don't treat fats like the they're a demon freelee goes a bit overboard with her fat restriction encorporate some avocado nuts or coconut a couple times a week whole foods has the best vegan desserts. the whole foods by me has amazing vegan chocolate cupcakes that i def recommend if your's has some i also suggest upping the fruit because it really helps with mental stuff i got out of my depression on a high fruit vegan diet) kate flowers on youtube is raw but she has some super tasty recipes like cinnamon rolls only made with fruit! so def check her out costco has the cheapest dates which are a must have if you're going vegan sorry for such a lengthy comment i'm just super stoked love you trish and goodluck 3,NOT
awesome video so proud of trisha id love it if you checked out my channel lots of vegan food on its way d,NOT
are there any videos responding to this with counter info?,NOT
even in porn they have categories.. just an example as funny as it sound.. they have an award for best female pornstar and an award for best shemale pornstar.. if they wanna compete the state should create another category for transgenders female or male i'm sure that will be more fair.. and that's not discrimination it just common sense,NOT
go on pinterest and search vegan meals theirs vegan sloppy joes and buddha bowls really good recipes!,NOT
it almost sounds like the wage gap is the product of men and women making their own decisions and there is a statistical difference in the decisions women make vs men i see nothing wrong with this.,NOT
this gave me a better understanding of the topic i didn't believe the wage gap made that much of a difference because it really does depend on the job occupation you chose it is understandable why a women would get paid less since he jobs women chose are much safer than the jobs that men do men are capable of doing much more than women in a physical manner it is not sexist its just how people were made in the video it explained that if you do the math the wage gap only depends on your occupation and the amount came out to . cents women tend to stick to jobs like counseling social work and education these jobs are considered the worst paying majors the highest paying majors are careers like engineering and science based which men have a high percentage employed in these fields i agree with the videos argument the wage gap is more of a myth and that it is all based on your career options its not to often you see a women working a very laborous and dangerous job its a mans job because they are able to put up with certain jobs better than women.,NOT
i love this!! go trish 3,NOT
i respect the fact that those kids are sticking up for what they're believing in and i highly don't like the fact that they're receiving criticism for what they're doing but if you were born a girl you're always a girl if you were born a boy you're always a boy just because you wanna change genders doesn't mean it actually happens but hey good for them.,NOT
i would love to go vegan but i'm such a picky eater and don't like many foods and i don't know where i would even begin,NOT
maybe the cisgendered women should boycott competing until transwomen get their own race then there won't be a competition to race in anyways for anyone until something changes cis gendered women need their own category period i also find it disgusting that people have reduced women to the level of estrogen or testosterone found in the body it takes much more than just hormone levels to create a woman after puberty everything from bone density to size and other important changes happen oh yeah remember the menstrual cycle that too women athletes often have to train so hard that they can even lose their periods which is unhealthy and transwomen who have not been through cisgendered female puberty say that if they just make sure the testosterone in their body is at a low enough level that they are biologically women and should compete with them this is madness hormone therapy is there to help someone feel like they are a woman it cannot actually turn you into one biologically it will not make you turn into the woman you would have been had you been through a female not male puberty i think trans people should be protected against violence but they are still not technically the women or men they feel that they are and do not need to be in the same category for sports why can't there be a transgender competition this is not like getting to use the ladies washroom that helps transwomen feel safer far away from potentially abusive cisgendered males this is about competing with cisgendered women scholarships are on the line here biology matters.,NOT

being vegan for and a half years best years of my life never turn back let's save our planet thank you for such a great film!,NOT
alright i feel like this needs to be said i never comment on her videos but i see more hate here than on any other channel it's annoying because most of you don't realize that  she likes the hate it's attention  the hate she gets is perpetuating the on the kitchen floor videos and anything similar trish reads the comments and sees the views and then she does whatever it takes receive that same amount of attention  most of you think that she's just a stupid blonde but look at her she will soon be approaching million subscribers and she gets tons of views she lives in la in an extremely nice house drives a g wagon and has designer everything despite what you think about her lifestyle the only thing most of you have to complain about her is her weight problem. i'm not saying she is healthy by any means and she clearly has an eating disorder but she's at least aware of it she clearly has some psychological issues with attention disorders anxiety depression and she gets attached to things and people which indicated an addictive personality not to mention her past drug use) she has issues so does everyone else however she works harder than most other youtubers i watch she posts consistently and has a hugely wide variety of content she's open on the internet and if you actually listen to some of the serious things she talks about she's more intelligent than you might initially think i'm not saying she makes the best choices and i don't agree with everything about this girl but i can appreciate someone who takes this much time toward something she works hard on her music/dancing which isn't my favorite but i still applaud her for keeping up with it anyway what have most of you done with your perfect lives?,NOT
but business have started to hire only women just last year almost /3rd of new hires were women despite being less than half of the workforce population this trend has been worsening in recent years and shows no signs of reversing.,NOT

it is likely there is some gender earnings gap due to discrimination in the  or so we cant yet explain but it is completely irresponsible to say we can't explain all of the pay gap therefore discrimination that is just bad logic this is a common tactic in politics to jump to conclusions in defense of personal agenda.,NOT
but do you have to transition in order to be called transgender like idk if she's telling the truth or fucking around but if she does feel confused of her gender identity maybe that means something .. idk lol,NOT

reason for wage gap is also that men have on average a higher iq than women you can see this by looking at chess/snooker ratings all of the top players are men.,NOT
warning this channel spreads climate skeptism and denial this is no university channel but a fraud the founder of this channel dennis prager is a religious fundamentalist and a republican politician in us clearly this man wants to spread the hatred of other religions misinformation against gender equality and basic climate science i have no doubt that this channel is funded by big corporations to spread lies and misinformation in people and thus make them weaker against their interests please do not share or spread the videos posted by this channel.,NOT
every time i see her her lips are bigger poor lil things,NOT
what about females having to grow children its more a problem of women not being able to have same carrier paths as man do because of their place in traditional society i think thats what real feminist not the extrimist ones fight for.,NOT
that doesn't mean ur trans wtf,NOT
update she failed she just uploaded her eating chicken and waffles on her ig.,NOT
i wish you would punch her in the face!,ABU
vegetarian for  years now vegan make sure to avoid palm oil too!,NOT
usain bolt needs to identify as a female so he can dominate the women's 0 m dash at the olympics well into his 00's,NOT
so.. she's a tomboy.. ,NOT
you had me and lost me why should we fix it it's caused by the choices people make in their private lives and we have no business there.,NOT
blaire mf white where r u at,NOT
"""why don't businesses only hire women? i mean if that were the problem they would just pay men less i don't really have a stance on the wage gap but if the gap were true no one is forcing businesses to pay a different wage so they wouldn't only hire women they would pay men less.",NOT
men are far more likely to die on the job i say that worth  cents.,NOT
i would have loved if the video also included some information about mitigating factors like the fact that women while earning less money on average are the majority money spenders and also gender pension gaps men paying more into it while women are the primary beneficiaries and other such mitigating factors which render the gender wage gap meaningless and might actually flip things considerably towards men being the disadvantaged ones in the whole picture society is much more complicated than single data points.,ABU
what about the fact that men are  times more likely than women to die in the workplace why does nobody talk about that?,NOT
okay i'll honest here i thought there was a gender gap in wages but never dug into the matter as i'm only a student yet and it wasn't a present issue for me i did suspect there was some bias in the men's one dollar women's  cents statement and i'm glad i found this video because it confirmed my suspect and changed my overall opinion on the whole gender wage gap matter i'll dig into this more i just hope this video and her university are valid sources,NOT
i love that you did this video i bet your political fans are sort of like wtf but anyway i completely agree she's doing it for views i find her entertaining too i think at this point she'd literally sell her soul for more views watching how low she'd go is surprisingly fun.,NOT
i agree there is no wage gap however this also ignores that while yes women lean to lower paying jobs for a women in a male dominated field it can be very discouraging and uncomfterable turning many women from picking that feild there is no wage gap but women are discouraged from many high paying desgrees not intentionally but rather just because a girl in a sausage fest is bound to feel uncomfortable.,NOT
"""yay a plane piss off plane! freelee the banana girl 01 😂😂",NOT
will pewdiepie be on there about the subscribers gap?,NOT
meat substitute products are not the answer they do not offer the same nutrients please note i am not working at all for the meat industry i just want to point out that animal protein is closer than vegetable protein to human protein animal protein is thus absolutely essential because it is much better assimilated than vegetable protein even when combining legumes and cereals you can be vegetarian and healthy provided you eat eggs and dairy but definitely not vegan deficiencies will appear sooner or later i have heard plenty of testimonies by ex-vegans who described the same symptoms general weakening intense pains in the muscles tooth cavities bloating.. it is all very nice to care about animals but we must care about human health as well.,NOT
not saying fruits are bad for you just make sure you're not over doing it because they don't always fill you up,NOT
expected feminist propaganda instead got a fair video explaining that the wage gap exists for a reason not because of sexism if only all of vox's videos were this unbiased and weren't seeping with propaganda.,NOT
im not telling you cant be vegan you do you so y u gotta judge everyone else,NOT
drinking the chicfila lmao xd,NOT
women are not as good as men at the highly technical and engineering related roles that generally pay the most for most people the reason why they are not as good is probably because they are not as intereseted in those roles for all sorts of biological reaons even though most women who enter those roles then enter management or quit as opposed to most men who stay motivated on the technical side less women as a whole enter management because of the starting numbers so the gender pay gap is not a gender gap but a talent gap people who take career breaks for family reasons who are not as nerdy/autistic and as a result achieve less and have less experience in short they are less valuable in the business world and thus are paid less people who are aggressive obsessed about their career position thick skinned enjoy being manipulative with borderline socipathic tendancies do well in powerful very high paying life dominating management positons can those traits be attributed to gender?,NOT
there is no different pay in australia just centerlink,NOT

good video objective and informative.,NOT
when you go vegan you eat more light instead of eating death,NOT
you know.. i do recall wanting to take more psych classes because that was the major where the girls were at however i was the fly on the wall of a few conversations where male hiring managers did discuss how between two candidates they female would be cheaper but you could depend on the male the decision was to hire the male because they valued dependability as mentioned in this video over saving the company a few hundred dollars a decision they felt would cost them more in the long run).. it was only one instance but i know it couldn't be the only instant in the world were that discussion was held behind closed doors and i know somewhere down the line the choice of cost would be valued more than dependability a non profit i worked for valued the latter but the boss terrorized the employees by threatening the boot if they weren't dependable at every corner a male worker there was discovered to be making more than his female replacement.. who was wonderful and very dependable but sadly underpaid for her service these videos have great facts but miss that there is an element a bias human element that does come into play when it comes to wages my wife also suffered this while working retail where a male counter part at her same level did less work but was paid higher and my wife was very dependable shit so dependable that we barely saw each other due to the demand of the job.,NOT
didn't freelee just post a slam video about trisha a few weeks ago like she was such a b about it and i like trisha i couldn't bring myself to watch any more freelee videos,NOT

all of the land cleared to produce veg for people had destroyd insect habitat.,NOT
mental illness over people's gender and sexuality is ridiculous and ignorant,NOT
chances of it ever being .000000 between the two genders is unlikely there always will be a wage gap it might be in favour of men and it may also be in favour of women the wage gap is a good thing as it shows that men and women make different choices based on their gender derived strengths and not because they make up the perfect ratio to appease idiots looking for .000000 gap.,NOT
i think if they make jobs flexible it'll make people lazy i mean hey might as well not go into work at all if you have a good enough excuse right womans just gotsta learn to hire baby sitters or trust theys kids.,NOT
technically businesses don't exclusively staff women because it's discriminatory which is illegal otherwise yeah this whole situation is pretty bunk so are the many quite like it information is all well and good but how are you gonna use it what are you going to do about this?,NOT

they would be mediocre in men's sports but win against women totally unfair.,ABU
when women can force men into or out of fatherhood without any ability on the part of the man who will be saddled with alimony even if he never wanted a kid it makes sense they'd have to take care of it more more rights more responsibility,NOT
just watch the first seconds that's about it,NOT
lmfaoooooo i love the chick fil a,NOT
i've said something like this for a while now the wage gap exists in some workplaces but women in general don't earn 3 less when it happens its more like. -3 less and guess what that -3 is illegal and is probably only still there because people often choose not to talk about what they are getting paid by a company as well as their credentials.,NOT
-men have better paid jobs than women quick we have to put more women in better paid jobs for the sake of equality there are more men homeless than women quick we have to put more women in streets for the sake of equality!,NOT
i love angelo ,NOT

random side note although conservatives are annoyed with it i'm still surprised to see blair eating and promoting chic file as they actively fund anti lgbt groups aka anti blair i was like whatever when i thought it was just the owner saying he doesn't agree with gay people but once i found out my money would indirectly be going to anti lgbt groups that's when i stopped going to chic file.......,NOT

i'm honestly so excited about this really hoping she stays vegan for good!,NOT
yay trisha!! i am so happy for you i'm sure you will love it xx,NOT
now this is an intelligent human being,NOT
interesting explanation but the false wage gap at :1 should be  cents instead of 7 if i'm not mistaken.,NOT
:3 you know that average and median aren't the same thing right i mean they might happen to be the same number depending upon the data set in question though they often aren't the same number as well) but they are still decidedly not the same thing or calculated the same way.,NOT
you left out the part where she says you being nice to her helped instead of making mean videos.,NOT
a lot of people compare earnings not wages so men tend to make more because statistically they work more hours then women,NOT
i think she should have said she was gender fluid....,NOT
yess trish yeess,NOT
it's so obvious this chick is on so much blow lol,ABU
this is intellectualized propaganda very cute.,NOT
you opened this video up with misinformation the statistics are based on what women and men make on average per respective position meaning that the gap varies over different jobs etc but on average is on  cents not 3) if you were telling the truth you could have linked to credible sources in the comments.,NOT
there is no gender wage gap only in as much as women do half the hours men do but want the same pay,NOT
really that is so great however it is way easier to go vegetarian and slowly become a vegan when you are ready a lot of people i know try to go strait to vegan and it is too much for them i was vegetarian first and slowly gave up milk eggs and other byproducts good luck!,NOT
yes there is a gender wage gap but its simply because men choose different types of careers women generally choose lesser paying jobs its that simple also men usually work longer or take fewer vacations,NOT
trish you've completely lost it,NOT
what is this world coming to if u r born with balls u should run w the guys,NOT
a man is always going to be a man it's extremely wrong to put men even though they have makeup and implants because they still have a male skeleton they're male!!!,ABU
is that an african tv show?,NOT
i'm not vegan or vegetarian but in general i just eat very little meat because i usually want pasta or bread 😂,NOT
god i love you vox,NOT
why not compete against the boys and make the point that girls are faster instead of against girls that way they're using their gender identity to make a real statement guess that's not the point...gets the noggin joggin.,NOT
i love you now trisha and i'm following u now cause of ur decision of going vegan!! it's my going to be easy in the beginning but it's going to be worth it!!! 😍,NOT

it's really sad that she's doing this with the assumption that is all accepting yet most of the comment and dislike are from people in/of support of the community she wants to be a part of.,NOT
i thought she was just trolling like usual,NOT
i just finished watching it yeahh!! i loved it.,NOT
um how did i get here i was watching pewdiepie😂,NOT
you can get vegan bread and have pb&j ))),NOT
please get help,NOT
maybe the wage gap is larger in business fields because the hours tell to be more flexible so women are more likely to take more time off to care for their children and therefore may not be as productive or meet as many quotas as their male or childless counterparts?,NOT
thw wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked and sick days it has nothing to do with the same job or discrimination.,NOT
as a  year old trans man myself i couldn't even make it through the video i felt so hurt and invalidated the pain of dysphoria and knowing my family is secretly annoyed and angry that i'm bi and trans it sucks trisha is so privileged and doing this just for coin and it's gross she needs to stay away and stop fetching minorities,NOT
been vegan for  years now.. it's amazing to see how popular it has become it's inevitable it will continue to spread as people open their eyes and to those people that say they only eat red meat.. well let them self destruct as their anger grows and their bodies suffer the consequences by the way chances are that sauce on your steak was probably plant based or at very least had more plant based ingredients than animal based ingredients. humans can survive and thrive on just plants but i've never meet anyone that has survived on just red meat alone for over  years.,NOT
vegan burritos and burrito bowls with rice beans lettuce peppers salsa and quac or vegan sour cream  sooo good.,NOT
on the people who say it dosent exist you are sorta right if you factor out childbearing it disappears the wage gap is evidence of gender roles that negatively impact people,NOT
the gender pay gap is a myth simple as that,NOT
i'm so early,NOT
foh...this is some crazy shit...we embarrass and destroy ourselves,ABU
that it ain't real end of video,NOT
hey trisha i'm sorry if you've had bad experience with vegans before in the pas not all of us are judgmental and horrible i am soooooooo extremley proud of you for finally going through and trying out the vegan diet seriously even if you don't stick with it after the two weeks i'm just glad that you spoke out about it in a positive light and hopefully you will continue to look more into it in the future as well  much love!!!,NOT
i feel like everyone should watch this and then open their mouths to speak,NOT
this video is so confusing,NOT
trans formers.. more than meets the eye....,NOT
i love spaghetti with portobello stemmed broccoli with quinoa and boiled red potatoes(seasoned!) soy milk tofu scramble portobello steaks stir fry.. lol i could go on,NOT
i don't want to look weird but.. in the end the man and the woman are part of the same body you can't do with a leg what you can do with hand and vice versa sometimes its possible but generally if not always one is more efficient than the other depending the case i do not like stereotypes but maybe unconsciously for example a man is stronger physical than a woman however a woman is better when there its about communications anyway i believe that maybe it would be a good idea for everybody if we tried to make a better use of our qualities than trying to balance everything.,NOT
being vegan is awesome but we need to address gmo monsanto and factory farming.,NOT
"freelee!! you are making a difference you made a difference in my life,i owe you months from vegetarian to vegan bless ",NOT
this is only a two man race !!,ABU

and the primary solution to so called man made climate change is cafo's they are causing far more pollution and damage to our environment than any amount of c0 let alone a few points change on current levels .04% the c0 lie is just simply appalling.,NOT
for every dollar a man earns a woman earns dollars because the man earned that dollar not the woman and that works the other way too.,NOT
13:5 . babe rae likes froot why aren't you tagging her name also all the other influencers in this i wanna follow . who are they?!,NOT
i think if she started making vegan cooking videos and would show all the yummy vegan food there is and if she did loads of other vegan associated videos without targeting anyone i think alot more people would turn vegan i have been thinking about turning vegeterian i eat meat but since i'm only  and my whole family eats meat it wouldn't be that easy but i really hope that more people will turn vegan or even vegeterian.,NOT
maybe the best paying majors are mostly male because women can't get into those fields because of sexism in the job field.,NOT
marginalizing or creating another league is not even... that is not the right way they are doing hormone therapy.. so i am confused why this is a problem that they are running.,NOT
so what if she's wearing the same dress as on the 7th of june doesn't mean it's a troll maybe she filmed it on that day and uploaded it later.,NOT
why do you want to make vegan sausage rolls making veggies substitute for meat why nobody's trying to make bacon taste like broccoli i wonder why don't you?,NOT
it's not true that you can eat as many calories as you want and not gain weight!!! try checking out some of high carb hannah's videos!!,NOT
she sounds like a female donald trump,NOT
you have about a dozen religious vegan doctors on your side and no others.,NOT
react to her photos of her eating chicken and waffles today😡,NOT
if you eat high carb low fat you can eat a lot without gaining weight but you cannot eat endless caloroes either if your body needs 50 calories a day and your eat 00 calories of fruit and vegetables yes you will gain weight but that's quite hard to do anyways as these foods are so calorically dylute but yeah i didnt lose weight by just going vegan you mustnt eat too much oil either but i think its the best diet to lose weight that doesnt include restriction or starving yourself,NOT
i love that trish is going vegan! u go girl 😊❤,NOT
i'm not wondering at all either compete against boys or start transgender teams you are boys now biologically born girls who compete will never win as long as there are biologically born boys in the teams,ABU

the equal pay act of 96 makes it illegal to underpay a gender checkmate feminists,NOT
oh my god wages and earnings are different you keep comparing earnings and calling it wage difference they are two different things women earn less due to their job choice/vacation time/raising kids/maternity leave by working less hours if they didn't they would earn the same amount maybe go back  years and look at the equal pay act of 96 where you already achieved your goal it's like beating in a dead horse jesus christ.,NOT

at first freelee i actually hated you i thought you were rude i really thought that you should have minded your own buisness but still i kept being subscribed to you still watched your videos day after day i saw videos of you telling celebs to carb the fuck up and telling them how fucking wrong it is to eat animal products today is my first day on a plant-based diet i couldnt thank you enough for spreading the messege and showing the brutal and honest truth without your honest words and the footage you show in your videos i wouldnt be on a vegan-diet today and i love it! i couldnt thank you enough.,NOT

omg was her major reason because i'm shooting a music video in two weeks are u serious rn?,NOT
actually it's all women and all men including those that don't work it also doesn't factor in anything from maternal leave to hours worked to length of career the study is just a statistic of what every woman in the us earns averaged out vs what ever man in the us earns averaged out including those that make billions and those that don't earn a nickle factoring those in tends to result in a lot of fields where women are payed vastly more than men per-hour.,NOT

there is no wage gap because if there was no one would hire men let's say i was an employer why would i want to hire  men for 00 each when i could hire ten women 9 each as an employer i would like to spend the least money and therefore wouldn't hire men as they would cost me more wage gap disproven,NOT

freelee's body is the result of over  years vegan and riding a bike 0km every single day it took her years to get that body you may actually end up gaining weight over the next weeks because of metabolic damage rather than loose weight so just be wary of that i hope you stay vegan after the weeks because you will notice that you will feel better and have more energy and of course you will be supporting the lives of animals but in saying that you might not loose any weight.....,NOT

these are the videos from freelee that i love good feedback and just so much positive energy make more of these ones!,NOT
oh no...this just ain't it you shouldn't of even posted anything until you fully understood yourself and maybe talked to someone to clarify how and what you feel what you're saying does not match up to the i'm transgender there are many other genders i think you maybe classify more as gender fluid you said you don't want to be offensive but you basically making everyone who hates on trans n others believe they are all like this you could of went about this so much better hun.,NOT
this is what happens when people say you don't need dysphoria to be trans,NOT

i had to check if she deleted this video because of her snapchat eating chicken and waffles lolol,NOT
honestly my advice is to take it slow and take it one day at a time don't rush in to it! just slowly start to cut animal products out of your diet and then it will start to become a natural thing ),NOT
freelee maybe you could also give her the advice of her going cruelty-free and vegan with her makeup there's probably a small chance of it but let's try why not ),NOT

oh my now farming is causing global warming  year study i smell horseshit this is nothing more than new age hipster/flat earth propaganda.,NOT
isn't this the same channel that said the gender pay gap does exist,NOT
i don't get why feminists and sjw's think that they females get paid less because they're females it's because some people do better work then you do and are more efficient at it a wage gap is if you are as efficient as someone else and produce the exact same amount of work but you get paid less which is illegal therefor meaning no wage gap.,NOT
imagine downvoting facts.,NOT
it does not e x i s t period,NOT
why cant i seem to find a woman who hasn't been indoctrinated into this cultural marxist version of feminism?,NOT
vegan since 01 and go on stronger than ever ! best decision ever!! 🌱,NOT
amazing how so many kids who are whining about feminists in the comments didn't even manage to understand the video vox didn't say that the wage gap was nonexistent they explained why it exists and what needs to be done to tackle it.,NOT
holy shit  this is real????,NOT
one variable that i don't see discussed very often is negotiation i started a new job recently and whilst going through the application process the company made an offer i thought i was worth more than that offer so dug my heels in and negotiated i ultimately settled on a wage that was 6 above the initial offer it's quite possible for two people with identical qualifications doing a the same job and even recruited at the same time to be getting paid differently just because one was prepared to take a risk and negotiate whereas the other just took the initial offer put on the table studies have shown that men are on average more likely to negotiate when an offer is put on the table.....probably because men are bigger risk takers and this could certainly explain some of the residual wage gap after things like qualifications experience etc are factored in again negotiating or not is a choice people make if you chose not to negotiate can you really feel aggrieved because you end up getting paid less than somebody who did.,NOT
they even run like men so unfair take off the wigs and go and to back to the boys change room..,ABU
i saw this how amazing there's hope lol so proud of her !,NOT

aint nobody gon point out how bianca stanescu speaks like speak&spell?,NOT
being trans wont make much difference colored girls tend to out run white girls.,NOT
i get what you're saying but i think the wage gap argument is meant to be broader than what you are talking about in the video the gap is not  cents big but there is still a gap i am not saying women and men have to do every occupation 0%/50 but the choices women make in terms of going to lower paying jobs is partly due to some sexism in the workplace and society at large a women might want to go into aerospace engineering for example but if she is geared from a young age to play with dolls and take care of things she will slowly go into that career path also the idea of going into a field with mostly men will be daunting because their definitley still is sexism in the workplace guys can easily become friends with one another and move up while a girl in an office full of boys will probably have a hard time playing her chess moves and moving up it is all these little things the wage gap conversation is about its not only about the  cents argument because that is not correct but more so about the extra hurdles women face in the workplace combined this with that fact women have the abilty to get pregnant and deal wiht childcaring makes matters more complex and will affect thier pay.,NOT
i want to know if the overall estimate is based on harder working jobs and higher up jobs,NOT

i'm so happy you're trying to go vegan so proud of you the best advice i can give you is to take vitamins to maintain your calcium and protein i take calcium vitamins as well as b12 now if you're just looking to do this for two weeks i recommend for breakfast smoothies bananas with almond butter(protein and drinking almond or hazelnut milk also eating lots of seeds and nuts are very good and yummy i make my own trail mixes for lunch time quinoa is also awesome don't give up and try your best to continue with this it gets easier as you go also there's vegan alternatives to hot dogs burgers and meat balls not the healthiest but if your craving that sort of food there's options love you!,NOT

there needs to be a transgender category the reason why this world is so messed up is because humans care more about their feelings and will easily overlook or play down facts and bend rules so they can cater to their wants/desires/feelings men and women are men and women transgender is transgender if i'm white and identify as black i'm still white the fact there's even an argument is evidence enough that humans feelings reign over solid reason and political agenda reigns supreme.,NOT

notice how the gap in pay jumped up in the 0s...something big must of happened then whispers equal pay act of 963) also people need to note that jobs do not have equal amount of men or women..meaning there's mostly men in the tech field there's mostly women in nursing there's mostly men on oil rigs or there's mostly women social workers with each field paying differently there should of been a comparison of same jobs from the same companies as different companies do pay different salaries for different jobs when the initial survey or study was done.,NOT
the issue with this is that they do not touch on why men get these jobs so much more than women it's not like there aren't women in these fields also they didn't touch on the biological aspect of the university majors all the maths and sciences get more money but men tend to have more of an affinity for maths and science while females tend to be better at the arts.,NOT

but you can't tell this to any of the feminists now a days because then it would be their responsibility to make the right choices and their entire movement is all about denying responsibility they claim that women in this country have no autonomy by pretending that they don't have it they want to escape their accountability by throwing their problems onto a non-existent enemy who has a supposed advantage or privilege that they don't when in fact that supposed enemy makes their own choices with what to do with their lives and either accept the benefits or live with the consequences.,NOT

whatever you do no soy it has an abundance of estrogen and not the healthiest thing almond milk is a great source of protein as does chia seed and flax seed these are little ways to sneak in protein obviously tofu and quinoa are amazing sources of protein as well carbing the fuck up is a great idea too even tho many don't agree with it enjoy being a vegan ))))),NOT
excluded?!?! you're excluding an entire gender you shithead parents you're not excluded compete against men or other transgenders but get a fkn grip!!,ABU

i watched the video she put in the description and it messed me up i talked my mom into letting me become vegan anyone have any tips or suggestions on what to eat thanks,NOT
y'all really don't realize that she's a troll😭,NOT
yeah she's trolling and the point of trolling is not caring about anyone's feeling even better triggered people fuel this trolling. not saying it's right tho,NOT
like i said before they need to have their own track and gather all transgendered people categorize them i e all transgendered males should compete only to transgendered male and do not mix that with females and vice versa that way everyone is happy this goes for all sports like wrestling mma ...all sports..,ABU
"""i dont wear makeup sometimes and i leave my zits alone i'm also assertive and powerful....so i'm a man""",NOT
lets be real here everyone who just drags her in the comments is the reason she keeps crying on her kitchen floor her mental health state is going down the goddamn stairs give her a break.,NOT
you are so much fun to watch you have a new sub ,NOT
their parents are some very selfish human beings that only care about their daughters and want everyone else to place the transgender daughters over their own is it fair that your male born child be excluded from female sports?? yessss!!!,ABU

so shes claiming to be a trans man who likes to dress in drag so a woman gender politics is so confusing at least blair helps me feel like im not the only one going crazy looking at some of the batshit going on but being a straight white guy i cant comment on anything anymore or theres calls to burn me at the stake.,NOT
"hey trish here are some of my suggestions posting this before finishing the video...-hummus and crackers avocado seasoned and with lemon and sriracha on brea-rice with basically any of your favourite additions mexican style or asian style ex beans,corn,jalepenos almond milk and muesli with fruit ontop-dates as a snack-watermelon juice",NOT
every feminist needs to watch this!,NOT
trish this video made me so proud of you sometimes(most of the time vegans or vegetarians can be brutal to meat eaters but we don't realise that we were once meat eaters and then we were enlightened it starts small i trust you to keep it up girl!,NOT
but there's no such thing as the wage gap,NOT

"sure  cents on the dollar may not be true but .6 is still really really shitty let's say you had a job that payed 30,00 a year and at the end of the year your boss came in toting a new company policy where all female employees are given a 200 bonus for doing your exact same job would you think oh yeah it's only .6% not a big deal, or would you be pissed that you were being payed less and told it must just be different choices that were hurting your income.",NOT
all these videos exposing the wage gap all seem to be missing the most important factor which is truth that even if after recalculating the gap we came up to .6% then there is no need to further justify that this .6 has reasons why can we not be rational and accept that this .6 or even .3 out of it is due to discrimination which we all know exist on some level and also we all need to accept the fact that this type of discrimination is not the bad kind as men are naturally better at ceo and managing positions then women which is even reflected by the fact that over 0 of female business owners employ a male to run it for them so overall it doesn't matter how big the gap actually is because it can all be boiled down to who is naturally better and not because of gender discrimination.,ABU
when i turned  i binge watched what i eat in a day videos documentaries etc and went vegan over night as i realized my entire life nothing meant more to me than animals. yet i ate them a year later i let my mental health become extremely bad and stopped eating plant based because i was wanting to destroy my body and didn't care about my own morals. i'm now  and i've been plant based vegan again for four days and it's staying this way no matter where life takes me.,NOT
it should be called an earnings gap not a wage gap then.,NOT
yes!! i'm so so so excited for you!,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap is that it doesn't exist.,NOT

i'm surprised that schools are violating some of the personal/privacy rights of the students so transgender females or transgender males can feel good about themselves are the state governments in on this and is the federal government in on this how do natural born female students in general feel about sharing washroom and locker rooms with transgender females when i was a teenagers i didn't want to take off my clothes in front of other females it made me very uncomfortable i remember either changing into gym clothes in the bathroom stalls or waiting for all of the girls to leave before changing into gym clothes i could imagine transgender females trying to get a sneak peek of a natural born female's body so they can know how they want their bodies to look if they decide to get surgeries to become more female in the future if i was growing up now and was in high school and i even glimpse a transgender girl just checking me out for those purpose because i know i'm being watched by any girl i would totally take a f in gym and skip it and stay in detention this is how shy i was in school i know there are still females who are like me growing up in this day and time whose loving them and protecting their rights/privacy i hope their loving parents and the same school board that are protecting these two i think all people should have equal rights i just don't think people should just impose themselves on others based on what they feel or think i think we should all respect each other but i feel some people feelings and rights are being violated so others can feel better about themselves we all need to learn to love ourselves regardless of how we look on the outside.,NOT
teenage boys could beat any professional woman's sport team ..pick a sport any sport....it's just the facts....bigger stronger faster in every way.....this topic is just stupid.....a dude in a dress is still a dude!,ABU
i still don't know for sure if being vegan is healthy or not but vegans please stop saying the strongest animals are vegan so therefore we should be it's the stupidest argument ever and literally makes no sense different species of animals have different internal systems that process food differently it's the same as a meat eater saying cheetahs are the fastest mammal on earth and they are carnivore so therefore i should be carnivore 🏽‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️,NOT

this is liberal garbage i've been eating meat everyday for most of my life and i can't get protein from celery sticks and carrots besides animals don't know they're being slaughtered and cave men used to eat meat too bad this is the thought process of many people who are addicted to animal products.,NOT

one factor you didn't discuss is the disparity in wages between men and women and women of color.,NOT
there is a theory that states that after accounting for variables even though women still earn less it is likely because they are far less agressive when negotiating wages and asking for raises whereas men tend to be more heavy handed in requesting raises.,NOT
at first i found her video hilarious but then i got a migraine see i'm ftm myself and in the past i've watched trisha's videos but only the ones where she hung out with other youtubers like shane dawson jeffree star etc that being said i never thought she was a bad person just a bit on the dramatic side now when i first viewed her.. video i was like cry-laughing choking on my drink and shit but when i really began thinking and began seeing others getting offended by it i rewatched it i can see why everyone's flipping shit trisha is literally using the transgender community to stay relevant because showing her tits on camera as a  year old woman is not working for her anymore that's.. that's bullshit. i remembered all the shit i had to through just to get to wear boxers or a binder or cut my hair etc and the shit that i still do go through being a freshman in high school class of 02 ain't lookin too open-minded.. yikes and that got me thinking what the fuck? like she's making us look worse the transgender community is already a hailstorm essentially but she's really dragging us through the mud her apology video wasn't even an apology like most youtuber apologies it was just a video of her trying to defend herself and make herself look like the victim i suggest you view that next sis.. but bring asprin she drags us through the mud but when we knock her ass down into the puddle she dragged us through she cries about it she's almost 0 and i think she needs to get the fuck off the platform really she's mistaking a midlife crisis for a gender identity dilemma luv u blaire you always do such great reactions and you're hella good at debating people and explaining situations you're- and this is gonna sound weird as hell- my favorite right-sider on youtube 3 keep doin what you do  sincerely that one dumbass kid who stays up way too late on pure caffeine alone.,ABU

....did she just assume their gender??,NOT
field of business demands lot of skills couple are risk taking and dominant behavior men are naturally more risk takers and try to defeat their rivals hence men on field of business generally tend to do better results and hence are more desirable therefore better pay also there is no such thing as wage gap it's earning gab which is based on experience education talent how long they spend at job and how often they get sick once these things have been taken into account then that gab suddenly is almost nothing.,NOT
if i was a business manager and/or owner i would set an hourly wage and pay everyone based on the hours they worked wait i think thats how it already works...,NOT

i agree with the state rules of those states it makes the most sense however i don't think trans people should be completely prevented from competing with the gender they are transitioning to it's a slippery slip but it just reminds me of the argument of it being unfair that blacks are competing with other races because they naturally are faster so it's unfair”.,NOT

not only does a wage gap exist but it is engrained in our culture explaining them away as individual choices ignores cultural pressures and child development one study i performed using multivariable calculations showed that the gender gap amongst college professors was non existant however simpler mathematics showed that higher paying universities hired more men than women and the higher paying colleges amongst those universities employed more men than women also the states that payed higher wages to college professors tended to hire more men than women this study took into account tenure education title publications age etc.. it was a small study but it did show a significant wage gap according to gender.,NOT

news flash sexuality does not equal gender ,NOT
this video is misinformed and misconstrues a georgetown study titled women can't win despite making educational gains and pursuing high-wage majors women still earn less than men to manipulate its audience one main finding of the study is discrimination even when women do everything right”—choose a high-paying field of study pursue a high-paying major within that field and get a job in a high-paying occupation—women still get paid less than their male peers if a man and woman who are equally qualified get the same job the woman still only earns  cents for every dollar the man is paid—more than 1cents to be sure but a far cry from earnings equality. to not include this principal finding of the  page study is disrespectful to the truth of the gender wage gap which might not be that every woman earns  cents to every dollar a man earns but it still exists at a cent deficit according to the sited georgetown study shame to prageru for disrespecting the truth and mission of this study spreading factually incorrect data with conviction and manipulating its millions of viewers.,NOT
relating more to men does not make you transgender being made fun of for being a girl with upper lip hair does not make you transgender thinking life would be easier with male genitalia does not make you transgender you can support the lgbt community without being a part of it you can dress and act masculine without being transgender you can have short hair without being transgender trisha this is extremely offensive to the transgender community.,NOT

as any woman working in a science lab will tell you correlation does not prove causation so it's nice to say women get paid less because they have babies! but not all women have children not all women are the primary caregiver and the wage gap still exists it might factor in but a survey will never ever prove a causal relationship and honestly the wait until you're  when your wages will match! and she's just also raising a family! are flimsy excuses anyway by the time wages level out later in life the man who was making 5 more than a woman in the same position will have a much larger savings retirement and pool of assets than the woman so that's bull pucky you shouldn't have to wait until nearly retirement to get paid fairly try again.,NOT

i'm glad you brought up masculinity and femininity not being gender itself i'm  and biologically male but at one point when i was  i was often being bullied for being too feminine and i got so pulled into that that i thought being a trans woman would solve all my problems but looking back now i'm happy that i stepped out of that because i would be depressed and regretful thanks to other men i learned that it was ok to be male and have a feminine side so again thank you blaire for bringing up masculinity and femininity,NOT
wow i'm actually shocked vox a liberal-biased news source actually puts out real facts instead of the sjw-agenda this is a step in the right direction the wage gap is not because of discrimination or women purposefully being paid less by male employers this was made illegal with the equal pay act of 963 it exists because on average women choose lower-paying jobs are generally obviously there are exceptions less assertive when it comes to pay-raises and work less hours due to things such as maternity leave raising a family etc.,NOT

the only reason why freelee can eat as much as she wants is because she has a ton of lean muscle mass the more muscle mass one has the more calories their body burns naturally this is why body builders have to eat so much trust me i went on rt and a regular vegan diet with not very much muscle mass ate as much as freelee recommended gained 0lbs freelee can eat huge amounts of food because of her lean muscle mass more muscle mass=more calories burned naturally by your body without exercise included do not make that mistake by stuffing your face and thinking you're going to lose weight eat whatever you want but until you feel full and satisfied simply eating like someone like freelee without as much lean muscle mass as her will definitely have you gain weight i've been there and lost all that weight by eating how much i actually needed to according to how many calories my body burns on its own please still carb tf up don't starve yourself eat snacks throughout the day and you'll be sure to losing weight at a healthy pace don't stress over oil or fat or sodium baby steps i wish you the best good luck!,NOT

the fact that this person is trying to explain why they identify as a man is what makes me think they might actually be confusing the fact that they like things that are not stereotypically liked by women with identifying as a man if you are trans it is because you are born that way and it does not have anything to do with your likings manners etc,NOT

i wouldn't exactly say that you can eat as much as you want without gaining weight or even for weight loss normally the amount you want to eat is equal the amount you need if you don't have disordered eating habit though if you have been restricting for so long then you might want to eat more than you need which results in gaining weight but this shouldn't scare you off since you need your body to gain that weight in order to cure the metabolic damage and increase your basal metabolic rate and eventually you'll be at an optimal weight for your body type hope this was helpful 💕,NOT
i disagree with this statement certain individuals taking advantage of the shallow system that is causing problems to very few other individuals can not be justified as a attack on women the whole thing is just just unbearably naive i don't care about anyones opinions or their feelings what i care about is the facts and numbers the fact is they should haven't been gone through any type of process of which they can be deified as transgender so they should have not been allowed to perticipate at the first place we as a society are facing some very dramatic changes we should be more careful to what we accept and reject now otherwise our future will only hold darkness for next generation we should keep an open mind but approve only with solid facts.,ABU
no no it's true the wage gap is real and it's because of sexism every single company that exists is either secretly in league with every other company to pay women 3 of what men make or it's just total coincidence that every single company that exists pays women 3 of what a man makes because they all sit around in their offices smoking big fat cigars tossing rolls of 10 bills into the fire all while laughing like like stereotypical fat british business owners from the 920's,NOT
tricia you mean plant-based because vegans do not eat meat fish and dairy products but also they do not use animal products so unless you plan not using your balenciage bag and any other animal products i would definitely rename the video just a food for thought!,NOT
it shows how much they make a year not how much they work my wife make  more a hr then me but i made 5k more then she did.,NOT
so you're a tomboy it sounds like you don't even know what you want to say or who you are or what to come up with.. hmmm. i'm offended.,ABU

men generally have to work in a less comfortable environment have fewer days off have more workplace related injuries and spend 4 more time working and women are going to complain that they aren't getting paid the same. smh,NOT
i do not suggest following freelee's diet her diet lacks in omega s and many other things plus if you're just starting a vegan diet and all you can eat it fruit and potatoes you're going to get bored you can't eat unlimited food either trust me i gained weight following her diet to a t check out the vegan corner and cooking with plants for some good recipes i suggest using the website cronometer to make sure you're getting enough nutrients in  even meat eaters should do this) also find a bmr calculator to calculate how many calories you should get in a day there's also plenty of vegan junk food if you aren't in the mood to be healthy.,NOT
freelee sucks because she stole content look up how freelee stole from us by get upset.,NOT

so proud of you i've been vegan for a year now and will never consume animals the rest of my life! the vegan community is awesome and we're here to help!!!!,NOT
if after factoring in choice the wage-gap shrinks to only . cents for every dollar that means that choice isn't responsible for a small wage-gap the . cents dollar is the result after accounting for choice this means that women are paid less on average some women are likely paid significantly less than male peers working the same jobs while in other companies women are on par with their coworkers yes a large component of the lager wage gap  cents for every dollar is due to job choice however it does not fully account for the wage gap and  cents to every dollar is still a significant gap.,NOT
trish is a whole headache tbh brah she's just making transgender more complicated,NOT

people so fast to get offended she's obviously confused about the meaning of what being transgender means why get offended when she's just trying to figure herself out and sharing it i guess it's wrong to share your feelings nowadays without people choosing to get offended instead of being understanding and kindly explaining/sharing your opinions on why her perspective of transgender is wrong you all bash her and shame her i though lgbt was supposed to support and help each other i'm disappointed at the reactions making a joke out of someone's real feelings and shaming them the negativity makes me sick.,NOT
i hope you know that if you have too many fruits.. all the sugar in the fruits can result to diabetes.. my moms co worker was pregnant and all she ate was fruits nonstop and she went to the doctor and he asked if she ate a lot of fruit and when she said yea he told to completely stop eating them because all of the fruits had sugars that gave here diabetes.. so too much of a good thing is never a good thing🤓,NOT
this video didn't acknowledge the large amount of women who do not have kids are are still paid lesser than their male counterparts my seniors who have graduated my law school were paid lesser than the men when offered the associate post maybe it's it just about kids.,NOT

how has she been with women and saying that one of the reasons she's trans is because she's attracted to gay men . i'm a little confused,NOT

"""individual choice"".. that's where the sexism lies do you really think having women in the least paid college majors is an explanation and not a problem in itself it reveals how sexism it impregnated in society because of differentiated socialization girls will be directed to least rewarding sectors literature classes for example in france instead of scientific section which is overcrowded by boys and have a very lower self-esteem than boys read sociology.",NOT
not everyone is perfect when they first start going vegan i think she got the message and that's a great start you guys also forget she has a binge eating disorder you can't fix an eating disorder overnight so what if she ate chicken the other day she also doesn't seem to know how to eat vegan yet give her time.,NOT
i don't know how this got in my recommendations but this b is bat crazy and anyone who supports her is bat crazy fyi i only made it to the :5 mark✌🏾,ABU

welcome to the vegan life here are some things that helped me when i transitioned from vegetarian to full vegan  water water water water your body is about to go on a journey so be nice to yourself and keep it clean  fruit for breakfast it's the easiest meal plan ever you can have as much as you'd like and the fruit you consume in the morning pushes out what you ate the day before  be kind to yourself this is a new lifestyle and you will make mistakes that's ok just make a mental note about what you ate don't buy it again and move on  if weight loss is your main inspiration for going vegan check out the skinny bitch books they have a sharp tone but are also funny and informative  when you can't take it any more and are seriously craving junk food remember oreos are accidentally vegan ),NOT

i am vegan and love most of your posts/videos yet i am concerned this documentary will undo all the good done by the game changers fear based motivation is never as good as showing the benefits of change the first 0-1 minutes of gloom and doom extreme activists and the sad mad little icon of the hour greta are a big turn off to me and most people i know do you fly to the many conferences around the world you attend if like the environmentalist said we have had previous environmental extremes that wipe out some species obviously they happened before coal planes trains automobiles and factory farming existed then who are we to be so egotistical to think we as humans are so significant our action or non action is going to stop the th maybe get back to focusing on the benefits,NOT

jesus you really explained it very well and justified yourself where's all the hate coming from,NOT
and let me ask why is it that best paid jobs are dominated by males and worst paid jobs by females i mean as a scientist arguing that there are so so soooo many variables i can't handle them all doesn't mean the correlation isn't real there's a wage gap as tiny as you want it to be) and there's a clear difference in how jobs are distributed there's also a habit from males to work longer hours or night shifts while women won't these are all correlations telling you something you can't deny their existence and that's why we are all saying there's sexism involved the reason behind sexism well we have to figure it out that's science awful video really.,NOT

i thought this might add more credibility if typed by a woman there is no wage gap there's an earnings gap based on career choices women make paying two people different wages based on gender is illegal if you've been compensated unfairly don't take off an hour at work contact the labor board because laws exist to protect you among millennials the highest paid demographic are single females because millennial women are earning way more college degrees than men and are thus getting better paying jobs mostly because public school education favors females speaking of stem half the medical students and the vast majority of biology students are female last time i checked medicine and biology are sciences don't believe the feminist propaganda perpetuated by women's studies courses it's not based on reality ok definitely my last post on here.,NOT

when freelee says you can eat as much as you want on a vegan diet she means that if you're eating nutrient rich foods i.e fruits vegetables legumes starches and a little of fats like avocado) you can eat as much as you want because those foods are less calorically dense than meat and dairy and fats if you go vegan and eat fried french fries oreos or foods that are vegan imitations of non-vegan foods you'll gain weight.,NOT

no one gets to be right all the time that being said let us pretend for a minute that a job interview is happening where the choice has not already been made about who will be getting the job long before the first interview was even held because some of the same qualities which men use to get ahead in business are discouraged in women within the business environment women do not have the same bargaining power over wages which men have during an interview for a new job the interviewer does not ever offer up front the maximum amount of money that the business has set aside which they can afford to pay the new employee men can bargain more from a position of strength to get that higher wage because this behavior is acceptable for men if a woman ever wants to be guaranteed she will be paid what is right for her skills education level and qualifications then she has to start her own business ladies christy wright has started a program called business boutique which is all about teaching women how to start and run their own business google her online for more information here is your way to get paid what you want hire who you want and set their wages fairly i hope you compete some of these other businesses right out of business.,NOT

just another cry for attention,NOT
notice how the lowest paying vocations are all caring professions which are all stereotypically womens work if there was no gender pay gap the lowest paid jobs would be brought in line with the highest paying jobs but unfortunately womens work is not valued and therefore not paid well men have more freedom in their choices to relocate and work long hours because it is traditionally the woman who takes care of the other responsibilities so that he may provide for the family' unless of course he has none of those extra family related responsibilities caring for ageing parents children cooking cleaning other stereotypical womens work).. this video literally goes on to say that people without responsibilities who can be at the business beck and call will be favoured because it suits the business and who in society has the least responsibility to caring men traditionally they're job is to provide and protect which in this era translates to bring in the money' this video is a contradiction of itself.,NOT

while i do think she's joking i think it's harmful because she has such a big following and bc she's the first or second video to pop up when you type transgender if she's going to mock a struggle and make some impressionable cis people think they're trans she should take into consideration how many people will see it and will believe it i don't think she even realizes how many people will see that video and it'll be the deciding factor for them to transition and then detransition because they done goofed.,NOT

yay trisha!!! love u for going vegan at least starting anyway....listen to me though do not do freelee's raw til ok don't! u will put weight on u need to do it for -4weeks to really feel clean inside and lose weight eat normal levels of fat protein but keep calories below anything freelee recommends,NOT
for iron and protein and calcium try to eat things like lentils and potatoes and kale and broccoli and things like this and you can try to not eat big meals a day you can try to eat many portions of food a day so your digestive system can break the food down easier,NOT
good for you girl! ignore all the vegan police out there the fact that you're even putting this out here as a decision is amazing you can eat all the food you want...fruits veggies potatoes rice grains beans etc don't calorie restrict yourself just eat until you're satisfied and don't forget to treat yourself wth vegan junk food sometimes love all your videos....i've been watching you for years and your videos always make my day love you and so proud you're giving veganism a shot!,NOT
it's not a question of whether or not there should be a wage gap it's a question of what that wage gap should naturally be given all the advantages that women are given the wage gap should probably be wider if we keep social engineering the disharmony between men and women will continue.,NOT
hopefully she sticks to it,NOT
i doubt this she likes junk food way too much.,NOT
last person i thought would go vegan but good for her🌱,NOT
make sure to buy vegan junk food ),NOT
i went vegetarian  years ago and finally went fully vegan the summer of 018 i regret not making the switch sooner but i'm so glad i finally did.,NOT
democrats are now officially insane can't wait for the olympics more teachable moments' democrats are idiots socialist idiots.,ABU
i want to identify as a transgender cripple so i can compete in the special olympics and if you argue otherwise your a racist bigot and intolerant,NOT
in the gap graph around :00 we see women born in 94 having a wage gap that decreases from the ages of 0-70 how is this happening why isn't the initial child-bearing gap ages 5-40 persisting throughout their careers shouldn't that gap be very hard to close for example if i save less when i'm younger it's hard to catch up  to close a savings gap  with someone who saves more when she's younger. are older women getting better raises and wages relative to older men indeed much better raises and wages to close that early gap or is it simply that the initial gap in actual dollars matters less and less as a percentage as the numbers/salaries get bigger?,NOT
try not to eat alot of processed food such as the imitation meat those can make you feel gross cause acne and gain weight eat lots of fresh ingredients and i encourage cooking most of your food if not all for the next two weeks also dont cook with alot of oils make sure the food you eat are low in salt to decrease bloating good luck trisha!❤️,NOT
great job trisha you go girl!woohoo!the vegans are here to help out if you need it!,NOT
if you are doing a mostly raw diet you definitely need to eat more food fruits and vegetables have high water content and lower calories so you need to eat more than you have been to fill the same calorie goals that is the only way for you to sustainably stay on the vegan diet.,NOT
this is so strange that a female wants to be a trans male to female cuz she hits on gay men should she not want to be a man,NOT
so we need to change the world to fit the ideals of women as opposed to leaving women to change to fit the ideals of the world that sounds efficient business owners will love this.,NOT
mmmm beyond meat love the taste of  ingredients trying to imitate meat delicious.,NOT
the point is getting women to be able to enter stem subjects because of sexism they're rarely interested in it.,NOT
trisha''s nails scare me.,NOT
but she had bacon eggs and butter on her snapchat story this morning soo...,NOT
she looks like young shane mixed with that kid from high school musical in the thumbnail,NOT
trisha is literally that yes im vegan yes i eat meat we exist tweet come to life,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earning of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination.,NOT
i can't say how much i hate you because i'm not a fricking piece of shit like you but trust me you don't want to come near me or i will slap you ,ABU
wow perspective changed,NOT
you know i think its not there is a gender wage gap or there is no gender wage gap its something in between only looking at the average income is of course pretty dumb it does not account for so much for instance more women staying at home however just brushing the whole thing off is not fair there have been actual studies that compare women and men with equal jobs qualifications and work time it showed that women actually earm  ct per dollar a man earns im no die hard sjw communist or whatever but brushing somethinf off from both sides as not existent or overexagerate is not too smart if youre interested in this go watch david pakmans video on gender pay gap.,NOT
peta is one of the worst places to get any of your information from,NOT
an employer offered a promotion to a woman whom had young children she turned it down comes with more money and more potential promotions and grossly more hours.,NOT

this video had a starburst ad lol,NOT
wait this liberal video just debunked itself there is a wage gap because women choose less hours? it literally said that lmaooo.,NOT
i think vox failed to notice that women don't have the same jobs as men...,NOT
zac efron what about rick marano or whatever his name is?,NOT
dont sound like gender/body/socail dysphoria its not fun to be trans at all the sugery s and the pain that comes with it and hormons for the rest of your life the axeity and the depression that comes is the reality of trans people that do all this to be themself and to make life worth living for them please dont just tell yourself your trans because you dont like masculine men this is not dysphoria.,NOT
glistening in the wind?,NOT
really well explained...,NOT

beans lentils grains yes you can gain weight but only if you are getting too much oil and sugar and fat i'm so happy for you!,NOT
what happened to pretends ,NOT
though as a member of the lgbt i was very offended by this video i think it's truly immoral to be so negative towards trish i hope to god that she isn't trolling we are all aware of the strength it takes to come out as trans so if this is who trish really is then instead of shaming we should be taking this opportunity to educate and explain why what was said in this video is erroneous i would also recommend finding a new gender therapist.. if the concept of dysphoria hasn't come up in conversation or the fact that drag queen or gay isn't on the gender spectrum then perhaps that is contributing to the confusion good luck on your journey trish,NOT
considering she's says been through months of therapy is kinda confusing that she didn't mention the word dysphoria once,NOT
oh my gosh we have the same looking cat is your cat named angela or angelo if it's a girl that's cool because i was told tabby's are usually boys like mine,NOT

while on a vegan diet its extremely certain you exercise!!! from to times a week depending on how you feel just take a  minute walk scrunches even jogging trisha you don't even need it much your body is beautiful!!!!!,NOT
veggies veggies veggies girl when i'm vegan i think of myself as a vegetarian with limitations eat loads of cooked veggies you can do soooo much with veggies broccoli steamed chopped in dishes green beans garlic and olive oil or coconut oil cauliflower spaghetti squash as pasta garbanzo beans are great they are good in a stew w vegatable stock or water beans tomato loads of fresh herbs chili powder garlic onion zucchini carrots etc i find that when you chose a healthy lifestyle like this it forces you to cook all your meals it's much easier that way fruits are cool too but it's really important to eat a veggie or two w each meal,NOT
you said what i been thinking thank you.,NOT
of course they have a major advantage....,NOT
this is very unclear advantage are people blind????,NOT
you can do it trish!!!! but remember to get complex carbs like rice wheat and legumes to help with dairy cravings eat fruits like avocado and nuts to satisfy that high fat craving good luck!,NOT
wow i was really enjoying your channel.. too bad you ruined it.. bye.,NOT
i'm guessing being vegan didn't work out judging by your vlogs lol,NOT
trisha is a very manipulative person she will do and say anything for views.,NOT
i think maybe she just if a little confused and has pressure on her and maybe she should introduce her self as gender fluid.,NOT
i think a big part of closing the wage gap is going to be empowering men to be the primary caregivers of children.,NOT
love you pbn  thank you 🏻💛,NOT
this is going to flip eventually academically females are far out performing males in addition many male dominated industries that don't necessarily depend on higher education are being outsourced or automated recent statistics referenced on other videos similar to this one suggest that almost every college degree holding profession with the exception of stem fields are already majority women also recently there has been a focus on equalizing that field do no doubt this field will see dwindling male presence it make financial sense that the spouse with the lowest earning potential stays home with kids i.e house husbands soccer dads,NOT
nope too much logic.,NOT
look at all these women in the comments finally admitting men are much stronger.,NOT
can you give links of your sources please?,NOT
i have been waiting for this ever since the video came out,NOT
theres a study by the berau of labor statistics that shows in fine enough detail same job different pay they do not state anything about employers but it does highly suggest a wage gap exists theory higher paying companies tend to hire more men for whatever reasons) this would create a pay difference not seen anywhere but statistics only way i can imagine wage gap existing and that study really does suggest it does also jobs that will match your pay from one place in order to hire you that'd be another way unequal pay could exist then femtards take this sliver of fact and go nuts with it.,NOT
just sent this video to a feminist i was blocked right away xd,NOT
i lost my way a bit on my vegan journey but i am back now will never foolishly fall off of my path again for the animals for the planet for our health body mind and soul.....,NOT
"she says this with long glittery nails and long hair, yes but the question is do you have gender dysphoria do you know what that is probably not, also with dysphoria people tend to wear less revealing clothing and want to pass as male but you're the complete opposite listen sweetie i'm trans and this ain't it",NOT
nowadays people use the word troll very loosely not a lot of people know what it means anymore so it was very nice for trisha to remind us,NOT
i love your videos but shes an internet troll everyone knows that lol it's a joke.,NOT
the wage gap goes away when....you get married think about it.,NOT
maybe women stay at home to look after children because it makes sense too since they earn less ,NOT
scientists have flexible hours... are you insane.. most scientists work their asses off over hours they barely have time to do anything else.,NOT

"""they chose this the amount of stupid in this video makes me sad.",NOT
i love her ,NOT
vox was a different place in 016...,NOT
this is awesome i remember trish saying in one of shane's videos that she didn't like animals and didn't care what happened to them so her ethical reason was very surprising to me i really hope that she can make it work but at least now she's beginning to see the truth and the benifits.,NOT
she's trolling for clicks.,NOT
what you're describing doesnt really sound like transgender because you arent fully identifying with a certain gender sounds more like you are gender fluid or nonbinary transgender wouldn't be the correct term,NOT
she's not vegan anymore please make a video.,NOT
blaire my ugly faces me bitch you're prettier than me-,ABU
can we get most disliked vid on yt pls,NOT
3:5 its because you gotta do another collab video!,NOT
vegan doesn´t mean healthy sustainable there´s just a lil bit more to it and yes iam whole foods plant based no processed foods -) everyone needs to find his own way there´s no reason to force anyone into something being open for new things is key trying things out for ya health for mothernature for the animals getinspired,NOT
oh my god im so excited  make sure you have a shit ton of carbs loads of pasta rice beans chick peas and fruit obviously if you're thinking of things long term there's so many vegan junk foods to help with cravings d,NOT
this is totally stupid,NOT
i'm a vegetarian 🐣,NOT
i don't agree with a lot of what summers says in regards to abortion but she is spot on here i wonder how many times she has had to explain this.,NOT
how is this cheating these are women just like you libs said they are.,NOT
this bitch is such a fucking liar lmao i'm screaming she can't go two days as a vegan,ABU
trish im not vegan but im so happy for u and i hope u get really happy and confident and i love you so much.,NOT
trisha is the biggest mystery on youtube i swear but can we talk about how pretty you look in this video that black hoodie looks so cute on you love you!,NOT
the problem isn't that women are paid less it's that women are societally expected to start families and take care of their children the solution is paternity leave and having children after your career is stable,NOT
and thanks to the pussy c generation we have to tippie toe around the subject so not to offend anyone ,NOT
you stupid bitch,ABU

"""what people realize about the gender wage gap it doesn't exist",NOT
cherry picking at its finest,NOT
wage gap stats so you aren't a subscriber to wage gap but that some discrimination may exist and that it can and will be dealt with in the courts right?,NOT
if you're really that butt hurt about it then get better and win instead of complaining,NOT
this fat unhealthy guy has anything to say against veganism ?? hahah ridiculous,ABU
having been a vegetarian since over  years this year i wanted to give being a vegan a try and so did veganuary and it was hard at times especially when going to restaurants but i always found alternatives and actually never felt like i was really missing out on anything. it's all about changing habits and looking for new alternatives so glad that the food-industry is changing and giving us more options gonna try and continue on my vegan path as best possible simply cause it feels right out of respect to the animals lives and our planet.,NOT
to sum up the video i'm not like other girls”,NOT
you can kinda eat anything freelee is on a highcarb raw till diet that basically cuts out any junk food for her until  it's not that hard i was vegan for a year and a half i'm not any more because i just want to try new things since i'm like only 3 any way just be careful about high fats and unnatural sugars good luck,NOT
ok sure mabye the wage gap has more to do with personal choice but if we look at the highest paying majors in elite schools / of them have a leading male public and when u see the least paying majors / have a female public the statement this research makes is that biology makes women more into emotional stuff like social work and psicology while men are more interested in mechanical work so when we look at this in terms of career choices of course men pick the higher paying career paths not necessarily because of the money but its what they like and what they're good at and what is really being siad here is that the reason why mechanical work is higher paying than social work is because we value mens work a lot more than we do women's.,NOT
gets breast implants nails hair extensions etc lol,NOT
trish just ate pizza yesterday fingers crossed it was vegan!!:),NOT
this chanel is a complete fake news full of democrats and pro-abortion people you should be ashamed by the type of america you are defending you left people want to turn the us into a socialist country don't you see what socialism has made it destroyed countries make america great again,NOT
this is amazing!! yes vegans yayayay keep it up!! if you ever are tempted to cheat just remind yourself why you decided to go vegan!,NOT
maybe it would help you loose weight i know people go vegan as a diet.,NOT
you dont know who trisha is stop acting like you do make your own damn content stop using other youtubers for clout.,NOT
i hope you see this trisha  you need vegetables like potatoes beans lentils kale and brocoli they all can be soo good you should check out pintrest for vegan recipes,NOT
notice how there are no biological females competing on male sports teams just because they identify as men?,NOT
okay first love your cat second it truly amazes me how people cannot be somewhere in the middle the gender expression scale without apparently being transgender/non binary just because a girl doesn't want to wear make up everyday doesn't mean she's transgender if that was fact then shit guess i'm not actually a girl then.,NOT
thank god for this video finally i won't be seen as sexist towards women who i'm simply attempting to deliver a simple message to this should be shown in schools to prevent young women to grow up in a sexist manner towards males.i hope this will go viral this woman is a hero!,NOT
this does not account for the fact that it is more likely that men work overtime and therefore deserve a promotion in jobs and pay.,NOT
he wrote what economists were saying in the 60s.,NOT
good on you freelee!!,NOT
abc is fucked,NOT
trish i think that you have what it takes to make veganism sexy! proud of ya gurl!💅🏽💅🏽,NOT

no needbto explain yourself?? if ur trans and gay and like being beautiful in a femme way then like fuck it thats ywho you are you never owe anyone an explanation to anyone,NOT
the number of salty men in these comments is ... expected actually.,NOT
soo not completing the same amount of hours is not the same as not getting the same payment.its a few flaws in this agreement especially towards the end when they discuss how women don't work hours because of personal factors ,NOT
i think this is more of trish struggling with the beauty standards put on women by men,NOT
trish i really hope you're not trolling if you're not i'm so proud of you this is the best decision you'll ever make my suggestions for protein beans lentils tofu soy protein powder and faux meat products don't be afraid of those!!!) there are lots more but those are the main ones i eat gardein meat products are always delicious most realistic taste and texture in my opinion makes it easier to transition my main advice make sure you're getting enough calories! eat until you're full you can literally never eat enough fruits and vegetables also vegan junk food is a thing enjoy it but don't make it a staple in your diet  good luck!,NOT

queen of rational thinking does it again ms blaire white 🏻,NOT
she's describing more of a gender fluid or a non binary person i don't know if what she was saying in her video describes a transgender male or female i think she has her identity's mixed up she should've done more research before she posted a video trying to express and describe what label she thinks she falls under she still has learning and figuring out to do she needs to take time away from youtube to find herself,NOT
spoiler this is vodka,NOT
but you stole those girls video!! you are bad for veganism freelee!! lol jk,NOT
this video is confusing to say the least but what she says makes some sense if we look at this from a crossdreamer perspective a lot of trans people live and present as their assigned gender even if their real identity is trans or nonbinary there are good and bad reasons for why they do so but the fact that they are not transitioning does not make them less trans her frustration of being a gay man in a woman's body reflects the kind of pain many non-transitioning trans people feel i guess some will dismiss the whole idea as preposterous given her extreme femme appearance but many trans people make desperate attempts at living up to the stereotypes trying to fit in kirsten beck was a bearded navy seal fighting in afghanistan before she gave up fighting herself moreover characteristics like femme and butch are not restricted to one gender after all these were terms created in the lesbian community i don't know if trisha is trans but she deserves the chance to find out for herself.,NOT
do they really need two videos to explain this?,NOT
so if i m to f then detransition back to m all in period of seconds would i be considered trans?,NOT

"sec 1 states that any person who willfully violates any of the provisions of section 1 section 5 of this title shall upon conviction thereof be subject to a fine of not more than 10,000 or to imprisonment for not more than six months or both no person shall be imprisoned under this subsection except for an offense committed after the conviction of such person for a prior offense under this subsection. this makes it illegal to pay women less than men based simply off of their gender therefore it makes the entire wage gap idea simply wrong due to this section that came straight out of the equal pay act that was approved by congress in the year of 96 on june 0th while the average man is more likely to take more dangerous jobs that offer more money while women are more likely to take less paying jobs such as psychology early education social work human services etc now take note that the wage gap is the average earnings of men and women working full-time and it doesn't account for different job positions hours worked different jobs or even the same job it just accounts for the overall gain because of this it looks as women are payed less when placing the overall profit of men compared to women because the more dangerous jobs pay more while the ones women are more likely to take are…obviously not but hypothetically speaking let's say that women are paid less on average it is said that women make  cents compared to every dollar a man makes which if you do the math can average down to 31,00 dollars lost in an average woman's lifetime or 0,00 dollars each year if this were true then employers would only hire women so they could save 0,00 dollars every year that could go to something else would they not business owners aren't stupid and they would certainly do almost anything it takes to have extra money in the bank so why aren't they simple the wage gap is a myth created by feminists to bolster their sad excuse for a movement.",ABU

men often get degrees based on job availability and pay men then seek jobs in the career field they studied in men are more likely to ask for higher pay men tend to stay at the same company for longer men stay in the same career field for longer men work more hours men take less time off men are more likely to relocate for a job men are more likely to convince their spouse to support their career all of these factors increase men's pay to represent the current wage gap that gap should not be closed by government mandate.,NOT

"jokes aside if she's being serious this is pretty much a prime example of what terfs think all trans men are people who went through some shit because they're women and think that disliking sexism and performing peak femininity makes them a literal man rather than a normal woman lol her constant talking about uncomfortable experiences and liking gay men more than straight men because they won't objectify her or treat her poorly and her literally saying herself she has penis envy makes it glaringly obvious she's not dysphoric she's just a woman who hates today's gender roles and standards which again is normal terfs are gonna be aaaaalll over this shit going see!!! tra cult is kidnapping our vulnerable wombyn!!!!""",NOT
i like how feminist portray the freedom of choice but do not actually look into the meaning of choice why focus on something that hasn't been researched properly and bark with claims plus men have a psychological burden of having a job however women do not have that burden,ABU
hi trisha i just started a vegan diet weeks ago and i wanted to tell you i feel great! i do struggle with it and you are right baby steps! i don't want to fill up your comment section with recipes but i have quite a few that make me not miss meat at all and that are super yummy! if you like you can message me and i'll send them to you: keep up the good work i know it's hard!,NOT
lol shes a f*cking professional internet troll its literally her job to trigger you.,NOT
eat only whole plant foods like brown rice potato and fruits for great health and maximum weight loss if you are scared about protein beans like lentils are your best friends with this you will have more nutrients than with almost all other diets animal protein or not and avoid vegan processed foods including bread) they will make you fat no matter how vegan they are they're totally fine once in a while but only if you ate properly for a long time and it will harm the whole plant food weight loss that you can get when coming off of a animal protein diet,NOT
typical abc trash you people are psychotics sorry switching your sex is not natural and we aren't accepting it these young people are confused young men and yes them competing athletically against girls who aren't confused is most definitely unfair.,ABU
no shhhh stop using logic.,NOT
i totally agree with this video,NOT
you go girl my biggest tip for you would be to remember that there is not only one way to eat as a vegan the way freelee and many of the vegans in the youtube vegan community eat is amazing and super healthy but if it's not interesting to you then don't forget that you can literally eat anything so long as it's vegan oreos dairy free ben and jerrys basically any vegan junk  obviously that's pretty unhealthy to live off but my point is just remember you don't have to restrict or deprive yourself of things you love if you feel like having some cookies or ice cream then why not  whatever keeps you vegan girl if you nourish yourself with staples like rice curries pastas potatoes etc chances are you won't even crave junk anyway  good luck!,NOT
if the gender gap really is a myth then that's great news it means we're on the right track for equality but i'm noticing a distinct lack of sources in the description and it seems to only talk about america i would be far more convinced if i could check for myself where the video gets these statistics from and whether they apply outside the us.,NOT
the issue is wage transparency in work places obfuscating pay impacts all groups this is because inevitably differences would be driven by the negotiation phase of hiring which ever group is better at this will be able to edge ahead for doing the exact same thing this is why all your business dots perform the worse.,NOT

screwing others so you can be happy...,NOT
i am a vegetarian and i had to unsub from freelie she was such a bully got tired of seeing who she was attacking next i think she is dealing with some of her own medicine now as i heard her channel might be taken down karma,NOT
i'm a lacto vegetarian and i don't miss meat at all proud trisha eat carbs such as egg plant mushrooms potatoes and stay away from sweets gelatins and gummies you can do it stay determined,NOT
thought i would try a plant based diet for a month after . years as a vegetarian..  months later and i haven't gone back,NOT
there is probably still some left over wage gap from previous generations where men have more experience and are the older segment of the labor force that earns more but the strongest argument is the first argument capitalism can't afford to be racist or sexist or else someone would have a company that only hired women and would have 3 more profits.,NOT
back in 99 when i was went to japan a girl that i traveled there with continually tried to convert and pick up this gay guy that we were working with she just wouldn't give up it was quite entertaining because obviously she got no where with him having said that why don't you and trish just be vegan.,NOT

"years ago i told my female friend that our job is hiring her pay would be about double of what she was earning at the time little over minimum wage) her eyes lit up big company all the benefits about half workers are female nothing she couldn't manage she was all for it until i told her its a night shift she flat out told me oh i cant work that"" from that point on i stop feeling sorry for her crying on fb how she is broke"".",NOT
i'm a bit confused it sounds like t is saying if you have a short boy hair you can't feel fem with that hair  i'm a lesbian women with short boyish hair and i feel fem  but tf,NOT
this footage is pretty old on her vlog channel she said that her vegan diet lasted maybe two days.,NOT
you are a smart female.,NOT
i like that she as a woman is telling us this proving that not all women believe in the wage gap this really helps to show it's not just evil men blindly denying a wage gap,NOT
i dont see anything wrong with this video edit the circumstances of which this video is complaining about or inciting should change. the reasons for the pay gap make sense and in a capitalist society especially in business economies which are driven by competition men seem more capable to meet the demand made by those companies that are competing with other companies hence there are more men in these economies than women and the men achieve higher and better paying positions because they have the damn time to it's not like a woman cant achieve fair pay i think we are doing better than ever by far when it comes to equality of opportunity but how does it make sense to alter the function of a business in a competition based economy just to fit a post modernist perspective of egalitarianism why should the outcome be equal if the factors aren't?,NOT
i'm so happy that your going vegan!,NOT
women were raped murdered for thousands of years to be able to compete in sports now a ton of mentally ill men think they are girls and elites play make believe with them this is oppression they have no right in our teams bathrooms ..etc,ABU
lol first seconds and they lie,NOT
freelee oh my god,NOT
this is nuts lol!!,ABU
loveee this info it is sooo needed and important!!! ️❤️❤️,NOT
why are you going directly vegan you should try being vegeterian and then slowly move into being vegan you cant go from binge eating fast food to becoming vegan,NOT
even as a liberal i knew this was true you don't have to do much research to figure this out.,NOT
you should get a lot of vegan junk food at the begin to help you transition that made it a bunch easier for me no judgment from me i just hope your two weeks as a vegan go very well  ,NOT
trisha is the type to go vegan publicly in front of the whole world and stuff her face with burgers and hot dogs while alone in her room,NOT
what i feel like you should've said was that a moment for you. just that then end.,NOT
but on your snapchat you just posted you eating sour cream and onion chips.. which contains milk.. so i don't know when you are actually doing this but just an fyi sour cream and onion chips contain milk...,NOT
i've been a mostly raw vegan for / months 😊,NOT
uber did a study on this too they found the exact same percentage gap existed but not because women were paid less if anything uber is renowned for its equality-focused business model instead women were more willing to work more flexible hours stayed in the uber system for less time and weren't as competitive as men with regard to where the best spots were the wage gap existed primarily due to experience behind the wheel in the uber system where men spent longer hours and were more driven pun intended to earn the most out of their position they deduced women had more obligations such as family than men and are more open to reviewing their choices by transferring from one job to the next men on the other hand are willing to find the most profitable position and stick with it regardless of how it goes it reveals the key psychological differences between men and women seem to reflect their earnings.,NOT
i am so thankful that she is telling the feminists that there incompitant trend followers,NOT
it's funny that our economy seems to favour less the jobs that women tend to take in what ways is a loan shark more useful to society than a nurse why are footbal players more valued than kindergarden teachers why are engineers which are very important don't misunderstand me paid much more than home health aides those are vital and immeasurably important positions yet most of these people struggle with income while bankers laugh away their problems with other people's money.,NOT
trisha im a gay man drag queen also trisha i dont like they/them its just confusing,NOT
this wonderful lady's video had claim evidence reasoning but if you ask a feminist to do the same on this topic they will give you claim fake evidence no reasoning,NOT
freelee gurl make a video about this 😻😻,NOT
you know why they are payed less cause if we are on a titanic and it's sinking women and children get to leave first,NOT
you can still get all of your starbucks favorites they always have soy milk and many carry both soy and coconut milk too so whenever you order a frapp or whatever just specify you'd like it soy/made with coconut milk etc ),NOT
there's some of us who actually eat high quality meat and lots of vegetables unlike vegans i have no deficiency i need to supplement for stop comparing people like me to the fast food garbage eaters do an actual study on people like me who do it correctly not to mention doing intermittent fasting with it.,NOT
maybe next she'll come out as eric cartman!,NOT
4k dislikes k ignorant snowflakes,NOT
this channel is like the opposite of buzzfeed.,NOT
thank you for changing your self to love animals just remember ur beautiful and plz stay vegan plz,NOT
i don't understand vegans who eat fake meat  it's not healthy  if you stand for not eating meat why are you eating something that's supposed to represent meat?,NOT
a female's body isn't built for speed and strength like a male's body to mix the genders together is asking for the females to be tossed to the side,ABU
"99 of the  year olds saying the wage gap doesn't exist"" don't know that the video agrees with them it's a good idea to watch the video first then comment.",NOT
and why are these particular jobs paid less do we just blindly accept that computer science is somehow better than education?,NOT
wait one year out of business school were these people working at the same facility or were they employed by two different companies who pay differently and is it possible that the men strived for higher paying jobs to better support a family hmm i wonder why these studies are so inaccurate also if employers could get away with paying employees less why wouldn't every company hire woman?,NOT
is that the girl from studio c?,NOT
its really spooky season,NOT
this video makes me ashamed to be trans gtfo trisha you toxic asf,ABU
can i just ask about the sources?? you list none in the description not to mention the lady in this video is from the conservative think tank..... also what about the equal pay act of 96 .......,NOT

she really was just eating chicken waffles on her snap also pizza i'm literally laughing rn for how much i believed she actually wanted to go vegan and cared about the animals and the environment.,NOT
facts dont care about your feelings....benshapiro,NOT
ive been waiting for this i knew it was gonna come lmao,NOT
what was their track record before they transitioned probably mediocre,NOT
trisha you should ask joey,NOT
so ur subscribed to trish but u hate on her,NOT
this is all a joke a sick sick joke.,ABU
lol trisha has been doing trolling videos for years i don't know why you guys think she'll be canceled,NOT
james charles who???,NOT
the fact that you choose to still have this up......when you've deleted other posts much faster and far less offensive says it all this is beyond sad and offensive to anyone in the lgbtq community damn.,NOT
this is so true.,NOT
i'm going to be a single parent when i grow up and i can see myself having the same schedule as women do.,NOT
wat is she saying,NOT
this was addressed back in the 0's and the 0's it is finally beginning to be acknowledged as a real issue factory farming of animals is so sad i tell people i love animals and that's why i don't eat them non meat eater since a little child.,NOT
"6,6 is not the same as % both feminist and anti-feminist are more concerned about promoting their narrative than the truth",NOT
dont listen brainwashed liberals,NOT
literally you make no sense,NOT
in short the wage gap is women making the decision to work less and shock getting paid less as a result.,NOT
you go girl i'm so proud of you ,NOT
wow thanks for this info i never knew the truth,NOT
you're my favorite youtuber  keep it up.,NOT
"""i wouldnt say its not fair yeah you won because of that surprise",NOT
i bet my ass this will give freelee a lot to talk about i love trisha and i hope that australian bitch stays the fuck away from this situation.,ABU
leafyishere did a video on trisha paytas a while back now it's time for me to do a commentary on it.,NOT
this just spotlights the hypocrisy of this agenda they always speak about how we are the same but physically we are different these agendas dont care about fairness just about being right.,NOT
"wage gap in st world country ""exists"" companies hire all women so they spend less money stonks",NOT
let the feminists and the lgbts argue with each other,NOT
there is wage discrimination my wife has experienced gross wage discrimination working as a contractor for the county a man was hired as a contractor to perform the same tasks with the same credentials as her he was paid eighteen dollars an hour more he didn't work his way up negotiate for more this was his starting pay.,NOT
i was waiting for this d,NOT
you can do it trisha!!!,NOT
so basically women just don't have the mind set to work out of there house and their just lazy or to weak for more serious jobs that requires men?,NOT
from what trisha is describing i would say that she is actually gender fluid,NOT
as agender i feel that they/them is normal hunny,NOT
take attention if almost of the people on the world decided to stop eating meat was a disaster for the nature because the natural animal leather was completly replace for sintetic leather made with petróleo qumical components please see on youtube how sintetic leather is produce they want sell sintetic leather or vegans leather how is know on world market.,NOT
i tried being vegan bc of freelee i gave up after weeks  i don't know how to just cut off meat completely especially when you live in a hispanic home and everything involves meat or dairy ,NOT
i think she's uneducated and manic,NOT
this is amazing trish!!! definitely get in the cooked foods beans rice potatoes! don't be scared of eating too much you need to eat more whilst transitioning i'm in la and would happily help you out with anything you need eating out grocery shopping anything!,NOT
i wonder were shes getting some of her information because i can't seem to find a link to it anywhere also prager university isn't a university and is heavily bias from the information i'm finding on it it was founded by a republican radio talk show host dennis prager come on now you guys i would agree that there is a wage gape but both liberal and conservative outlets have already put so much trash statistics that supports only their side that finding the true gap would be hard would it be a big enough difference to argue about thinking logically your never going to make everyone happy so of course people will still argue at the end of the day it falls to an individual's effort to do what you have to so you can be where you want to be.,NOT
there's a wage gap because of the different choices men and women make not because of discrimination. 🏻,NOT
those people belong in a mental institution not on a female track team shame on that school.,ABU
see i have trouble with this video it does present facts but is very biased how does pay and bonuses compare between men and women in executive roles how does pay compare between men and women managers and supervisors how does pay compare between men and women in technical fields engineering programming etc) really i could probably make a video espousing the benefits of tobacco smoking how it helps focus the mind increases productivity reduces stress in stressful situations is a mild appetite suppressant so can help with weight loss without leading to an eating disorder doesn't cause mental instability like hard drugs do afterwards you might be totally convinced that smoking is amazing at the same time the video would be misleading because it doesn't present the risks of smoking so yeah men and women working in low level jobs are going to be paid the same or are they?) men tend to gravitate to higher earning jobs and women tend to gravitate to caring jobs but i need to see like for like comparisons in a sample of specific fields before i would be convinced making a video like this is just fluff for sexists and misleading for others.,NOT
"oh my goodness,i was watching 017's and 8's and just now thought i'm gonna have to watch the 01 edition and boom it's just been a day since the upload it's like i manifested it.",NOT
i'm satisfied with the like/dislike ratio,NOT
totally unrelated trisha's lip fillers look like they are failing,NOT

sounds like someone doesn't understand gender,NOT
sweet potatoes are yummy! cut them into thin circles and put some coconut oil freshly chopped garlic and cayenne pepper powder if you like spicy. but be careful this powder is strong so you only need a tiny tiny bit and put them in the oven on 5 for about 0-3 minutes check on them),NOT
when a femina makes this.. liked,NOT
jesus i should have gone to that business school.,NOT
watching atm.. the speech at 1:2 with the sounds of pigs screaming game me the worst shivers ever such a powerful editing.,NOT
well that's good news,NOT
more videos like this please,NOT
so now that she's not in the news for exposing the vlog squad now she's moving on to offending the whole lgbtq community she really wants her name in the news doesn't she she really trying the most ,NOT
transgenders are abnormal only stupid white liberals will defend this the black liberals are even dummer for listening to the white ones of course a women principal would allow this real men are not liberal go to your safe spaces u stupid liberals.,ABU
fair play to vox you were the last people i expected to make a video like this i understand you are still hyper-liberal but we all appreciate these types of factual rather than ideological videos.,NOT
the only real way you will make a huge movement is if you will create a catchy more lighted more positive not lemme scare you type of documentary but more of a fun and it's easy to change the world and easier to achieve than you think attitude show real stories of real people talking about their transition to vegan life their daily eating food prep habits cravings snacks etc you name it recommend good vegan foods available in shops to the population just make a more visual documentary which will make people think it's cool and actually make them want to give it a try it's all about marketing ya'll,NOT
everyday thousands of innocent plants are killed by vegetarians help stop the violence,NOT
you are poor because you want to if you work hard instead of complaining you will get far be humble and give your best don't be a crybaby,NOT
this is all good and factual but shouldn't we look into why those types of jobs that are traditionally associated with women are paid less?,NOT
for every dollar a man makes a woman makes quarters.,NOT
it has a lot to do with aspirations upbringing and education environment/location/'privelege' and even career choice... obviously an underwater welder who works a week welding under the ocean for full 12-1 hr day and living on site for a full week and going home for another two or what have you will make more than a chick who just goes and does nursing.. women tend to take far less risks especially when it comes to their lives knowingly/consciously anyhow) there are jobs that pay danger pay i can guarantee you will find a largely male workforce for said types of employment/career thank you vox for being reasonable and having some common sense....,NOT
2:5 yes it is fair for real women,ABU
lol yeah snap chat was different but i still luv u 💕,NOT
i support the transgender community but come on biologically they do have an advantage not discrimination.,ABU
this is a logical argument oh so that's why extreme feminists so hear this.,NOT
deep throating not quite,NOT
there is no wage gap there is an earning gap because there are more women in lower paying jobs like nursing teaching etc because that is what more women choose to do.,NOT
ok i'm going to get hate for this but here we go i dont think theres anything wrong with trans men doing drag i personally use a form of drag i guess? to make fun of the things about myself that make me uncomfortable i also hate trenders and all of that shit god i hate uwu soft boys.,NOT
ugh u make michael jackson fans cringe,NOT
tofu is good in protein salads tofurkey sandwich chao cheese is really good alternative peanut butter or nuts are good for protein good luck and i am proud of you for trying every little effort makes a difference!,NOT
trisha has bpd so an identity crisis is just another day for her it's an attention thing so don't take it on too much blaire.,NOT
"when i saw the title what people miss about the gender wage gap"" i thought it would talk about how blatantly the wage gap is calculated by just dividing the average earning of a male by the average earning of the counterpart female) but nooo this video along with certain feminists yes not all feminists are alike just like how all muslims aren't terrorists) politicians and celebrities completely ignore the fact that some women choose different careers and work hours hey by the way the number of employed men that are alive should also different from the number of existing employed women well that's just a hunch and i'm 4 so judge what you will) furthermore just for a second let's assume that the wage gap is in fact real and women get paid 7c for every dollar a male makes that said why for what reason don't all companies hire only women since it is 3c cheaper than hiring a male don't companies want the most bang for their buck and not spend more money than they have to this would save tens of thousands maybe millions of dollars every year if their workforce only was comprised of women well who knows anyways i am not trying to diss women here please that is not the message i am trying to get across if that is how you feel i apologize) moreover i do concede that women do work less than men in most cases due to their schedule and that is what this video talks about and that is what we should be worrying about and for that reason i did not dislike the video but nor did i give it a thumbs up so fighting to get rid of the stereotypical notion that women should be at home solely responsible for the kids is the real war we should be fighting and we are we are progressing but we are obviously not there yet and everyone should be contributing this also isn't just about women but everything that concerns another human's well being paraphrased from mlk) so there isn't anything wrong about a feminist or any advocate for that matter as long as you are well educated so what i'm trying to say is earning does not equal wage cookiopuss ps youtuber) neither is the earth flat and thanks for reading all of this if you did.",NOT
feministpropaganda against facts.,NOT

"i think that firstly there is a huge mix up between the unequal pay for the same job wich is illegal and the gender wage gap the actual 0cts/1dollar wich is a real problem that being said yes it can be explained with the job differences of course there is an explication but the problem is that womens don't actually chose not to be an ingeneer or a computer scientist they are more or less unconsciously banned from those kind of jobs because historicaly these are men jobs"" and that's exactly what is unfair and what we have to fight against because a women isn't less legitimate to be an ingeneer and neither naturally more skilled to be a nurse btw imo this channel is dangerous because they always avoid the real debate instead they focuse on prooving smthing else which is easier and then claim to have solved the debate.",NOT
our lord and savior,NOT
yes trisha i'm vegetarian and i've been working on going completely vegan i know what you mean when you say you can't eat meat anymore after becoming more aware that happened to me when i decided to make that change i hope that you'll be able to stick with it!,NOT
women worker works less then fellow male worker male worker works more then women worker takes less vacation and works over time also doesn't take days off to see child if he has one women gets paid less man gets more women suprised pikachu also pay gap has been disapproved by a women  equal opportunity / equal outcome,NOT

so once in awhile you like to dress up you're attracted to men you can't have and like sensitive men and you wish u had a dick because you associate power with having a penis your thinking isn't that complicated you're not transgender you just haven't had a nice conversation with yourself to think threw your thoughts and feelings talk with your therapist about what you just talked about i have a feeling he might be able to help u out now if he doesn't then u might need a new one.,NOT
so two black men want to race with women?! 😂 smh 🏻‍♂ if this happened at my sons school i'd have him do the same thing just to piss off the school for letting this shit happen,ABU

absolutely cool!! thank you babe for doing that it's a win win you have to eat a lot in the beginning to prevent from backsliding make sure to get loads of diversity like nuts seeds nut butters vegan toast bread whole grain organic trader joe's is excellent gourmet and reasonably priced all together the santa monica farmers market is fantastic for everything raw plant food.,NOT

my mom still refuses the facts if only she understood the people influencing her are crooked and just have a good personality on tv,NOT
sooo what you are saying is that actually women are stupid and take all the wrong decisions or or wait you are saying that there is a gene in the y chromosome that allows men only to work long hours without notice really... is there a study to prove such a thing or you just thought of it and if this is the case after all and let's say that all the gender wage gab is created by choices why women feel compelled to make choices like these is society driving them is it the fact that they are the only humans that can actually reproduce the species or maybe we should change that let's stop reproducing since it all boils down to choices because being the only one capable of giving birth is a choice sure thing and by the way call your mother and inform her that as a woman she is not willing to work long hours without notice i am sure she will have a few things to say about that good day!,ABU
i come back here once in a while to like the new hate comments xd,NOT

larabars they're super yummy and they're nice to have as a quick snack through the day when you're feeling peckish i love eating rice with some potatoes and onions and other stuff but going vegan is all about getting creative with your meals the meat and dairy industry is so huge that it makes it nearly impossible to just go to the store be able to grab some food without worrying if it's vegan or not whole foods will be your best friend! pasta is yummy and sooo filling potatoes rice and beans are always great just be careful when i started out vegan i got the same advice but for some reason i never thought to add anything in to my food to make it taste better so more often than not i was sitting there eating plain rice and getting full but hating what i was eating imagine if you just cooked a burger patty but didn't add any spices or literally anything at all to it and just ate the cooked ground beef not yummy same applies to vegan food if you don't spice it up pun intended it'll definitely make you start to resent going vegan i recommend following lots of twitter/instagram/pinterest/youtube accounts that are vegan so you can stay motivated and find new tasty recipes i know i'm not the only one who's obsessed with those buzzfeed cooking videos so it's the same concept you see something tasty you want it just make sure it's vegan good luck girl! you might get discouraged at times but that's completely natural keep your end goal in sight stay positive and love yourself! you can do it 3,NOT
i'm so tired of people identifying as trans or they/them just because it's popular it's a fad a trend and definitely clickbait for big youtubers it's like you said just do you you don't have to be trans to be more masculine or feminine or neither tbh) just ugh people come on.,NOT
oh it's only  less then i guess it isn't an issue right who cares as long as it isn't a 3 difference how can you cite a study showing a gender-based pay gap and then say there is no pay gap how dumb do you think we are this video completely sidesteps the fact that women feel compelled to enter these traditionally female majors just as men gravitate towards traditionally male majors it's kind of unfortunate that women were given lower-paying jobs when they entered the workforce in ww2 because now the roles have solidified into basically the same roles from  years ago men get higher-paying jobs because they were traditionally the main income earner and women were either single and living on their own or just earning a little extra pay i've gone through the data did you know that women are more likely to switch majors if they earn a low grade in the introductory classes c's get degrees yet for some reason women feel pressure to earn better grades than men on average prageru also forgot that maternity leave is expensive and that it's the most commonly cited reason employers have when they are found to have different pay rates for men and women in the same job why would you hire someone who gets a month of paid leave when someone else doesn't when a woman goes on maternity leave a new temp must fill in until she is gone or the firm goes with one less worker for a month either way it's an expense they don't have with male employees.that's why people are arguing for paternity leave so this difference is resolved prageru best cherry-pickers on youtube who needs truth when you can just ignore everything that proves counterpoint to your beliefs?,NOT
i'm so excited for you! i've been vegan for almost - months now and i love it one of my fav got to snacks is frozen bananas which are really ripened a few splashes of plant based milk any kind of sweetener and then blitz it in a food processor super easy and fast i highly recommend 3,NOT
this is an important video there are a lot of emotions and identity politics at play when discussing the wage gap which causes it to become an all or nothing it exists or it doesn't! debate if we can all stop breathe and acknowledge exactly what is causing this wage gap then we can find areas where it can be mitigated paternity leave is a good place to improve upon for example.),NOT
oh no lefty..no no no no..this whole men and women are equal crap has been pushed down our throats for years..now its time to own what you've created..i want to see dudes in lipstick in all female(oh thats right there are no genders anymore either right lol sports..and remember..you got what you wanted,NOT

title there is no gender wage gap script a study shows that the actual wage gap is .6% makes perfect sense,NOT
its all about baby steps and im so proud of you for doing something to better yourself and you have to take small steps to stay vegan and not get off track but yes you definitely need more foods more greens more beans and grains etc another thing you should push your viewers to watch those slaughterhouse videos because it does really show you exactly what happens and makes everyone who sees them understand how horrible the reality of the situation is and it could make everyone change their views just like it did for you again i am so proud of you trish for doing this,NOT
hey trish congrats on going vegan  there's lots of protein in nuts and some vegetables if you find that you aren't getting enough protein there's vegan protein powder that you can find in some places and make sure you eat enough calories!!,NOT

my english teacher is sooo feminist and liberal we don't even learn english in class anymore...,NOT
i think she is trying to say she doesn't identify her gender as female but is going about it in a weird/wrong way,NOT
i feel like she is so mixed up about terms and what it means to be transgender she just wants to be casual and seen as a person rather than a sex object which is how she associates women probably because most of the time that's her experience and that's not something anyone should have to just accept and like that's totally valid but that doesnt necessarily mean that shes a man being comfortable not wearing makeup in your day to day life and being super low maintenance except when you want attention is not a trait specific to men that's how a lot of cis women are too not wanting attention from random straight men is not a trait specific to men having short hair as a woman doesnt make you trans i have a boys haircut but i'm a female it seems like much of her reasoning is just based off of bias of how women and men and gay men and straight men are supposed to be or usually are instead of grouping all straight men in with toxic masculinity and misogyny we need to recognize that any man can be feminine if he wants and of course all men should respect women of course i know it's mostly straight men who dont and who sexualize women and all this but it's not exclusive to straight men either) also her comment about having penis envy is another reason i think shes just mixed up she equates men with power and having a penis with the way shes percieved she is a woman but the trauma shes experienced from being a woman especially a very outwardly sexual woman in todays society has caused her to have extreme biases towards what certain genders mean i'm not blaming her this is mostly indicative of a larger problem in todays society but i feel bad for her that she thinks she has to come to terms with being transgender in order to just live comfortably and dress how she wants very concerned with outward image and she feels like she needs to be trans to justify it,NOT
read for all the answers you need!** and to add eat whatever and how much you want is sort of a lie to me) try to keep your calories still around the recommended 00 area and eat foods that are easy to digest for you drink lots of water no soda or anything like that keep the sodium low that will help prevent bloating the most and try to keep around below 00 mg a day 0 mg at most is best because our bodies aren't used to digesting sodium so it clings onto water cells which makes you appear bigger because then that water can't exit your system due to the bloating you can also eat starches like rice potatoes not french fries baked potatoes or even sweet potatoes are the bomb! and also oatmeal pasta whole grain! but no bread bread has a lot of sodium and it is so hard to digest pasta has nearly no sodium and oatmeal has barely 0 per serving i would also suggest to have melons and fruit as a lunch like a fruit salad and banana smoothie for lunch after a oatmeal breakfast make it with water though and calorie sweeteners aren't as bad as people think as long as its saccharin and not aspartame with lots of fruit on top i love pineapple strawberry and blueberry! and last but not least you do need to do the tiniest bit of exercise maybe walking around town or around a mall for about an hour a day will help loads okay i'm done ranting xd remember low fat less than  g a day is when i feel best high carb around 00-50 is what i usually get in a day and around 500-200 calories which is what i et around and low sodium i usually have around 00-100 mg a day and about an hour of walking and you'll do great!!! i really hope you've read this and if you have please give me feedback by replying if this has helped remember i went from 6 pounds to my lowest of 05 so i know what i'm saying ),NOT

feminists won't be satisfied until the waitress at red lobster makes as much as the alaskan crab fisherman.,NOT
the argument that educated activists are making about the inequality in overall pay is that women gravitating towards lower paying majors is the issue systematic sexism is the problem i personally have never claimed that individual businesses are paying women less though that may be true for some) it is the expectations of women in society that are the real problem we need to advocate for encouraging young women and showing them that they are capable of pursuing careers in male dominated fields the expectation that women must be the primary carers for children which in itself is no issue but the expectation is!! is another problem that forces women from getting demanding jobs this video's points did not address this problem at all and instead made the points supporting the inequality argument much clearer systematic sexism is the problem not an abundance of individual sexism in each employer focus on the real issues please not responding to a tangential point.,NOT

my tips are definitely to educate yourself watch documentaries what i eat in a days vegan youtubers etc many of the documentaries are on youtube and netflix and for food wise eat stuff that will keep you full! i didn't do that when i started out and just binged like crazy male sure to still get your protein and carbs and all that good jazz and also some things that i didn't know was that there's such thing as an accidental vegan foods what! again research it and figure out more about these things and ignore the haters girl stay strong! so proud of you this is probably going to be the most healthiest decision you could ever make💕💕,NOT
said it once ill say it again you don't put able bodied athletes against disabled athletes why because it put the disabled person at a disadvantage in this case it puts the trans athletes at an advantage whether you like it or not it's discrimination against those who are born female you cannot treat a person with a protected characteristic less or more favourably that is discrimination sorry but that's the law guys xx,ABU

i can't believe the world is conforming to this kind of shit.,ABU
so your justification for this makes me trans yeah no no just no you can be a tom boy get on better with men especially gay men you can support the lgbtq community i have always been a supporter/advocate for lgbtq but doesn't make me trans i dont always wear make up or glam this doesn't make me trans people are really struggling for acceptance and with their own identity because they identify as trans seriously people who are trans are struggling and fighting to be treated equally in the workplace and not be discriminated against in their place of work as we speak please stop jumping to conclusions you have not researched properly becuase of you have more masculine energy',NOT

 things cause a gap in wages choice analytics and apathy the first of the main issues with choice of field of work was highlighted and dramatically reduced the gap” secondly males by nature are neither the most emotional or caring of our race for this reason males make a great choice for doing rolls that are terrible eg garbage man trauma cleaner plummers etc and even in the same field compare a contracts or criminal lawyer against a family or immigration lawyer and there will be a higher number of males in the worse areas further because of the lack of emotional it makes the able to make decisions based on an analytical process rather than personal feelings at the same time these traits are terrible for someone that works in other roles such as child care nursing etc but that's not to say either side of our race is any better than the other it just means that different people are suited or enjoy different roles further not all males or females follow the inherent typical male or female ways of thinking which is solely why we do see male in roles that females enjoy and vice versa in actuality it's not actually a problem not only because most people are married at some point and share their income or though logically we might actually want to enforce a pay gap for married men to be payed more to give mothers the option of being able to spend more bonding time with their children because children aren't a burden they are something special to love and care for.,ABU

exactly thank you i think people who pretend that it's  cents on the dollar for the same job are doing more harm than good and unfortunately that includes some people in the public spotlight like obama the implication is that women earn less because employers are mysogonists who systematically opress their female employees duh* yet that's not what's happening there are many factors to consider the most obvious one being that men don't get pregnant and that women are less likely to disregard their family life and children in favor or their jobs.,NOT
6:0 is what everyone referencing,NOT
yaaaaaaaaaaass trisha i'm so happy for you that you're trying out the vegan life i myself went vegan for a eek and never stopped because it's just so easy refreshing and rewarding my advice would be literally buy all the veggies their natural delicious taste comes through more the more you eat them i find and get into home cooking but if not there are tonnes of vegan replacements out there way more out there in la than there are here in britain i wish you the best of luck and hope you enjoy and stick with this journey xoxo,NOT

it won't last if you don't eat enough listen you have abused your body for years by going on these crash diets that means you have something called metabolic damage in the beginning freele gained weight as a vegan because her body wasn't used to that much food so yeah you will gain weight in the beginning but once your body has had time to heal you'll lose fat not weight but fat and that can take some time maybe a year so if you think vegansim is the solution to lose weight before your music video you're wrong i still hope you'll go vegan bc vegansim is the long term solution to weightloss and you will never have to crash diet ever again i just hope you are not going to starve yourself in order to lose weight go crazy bc of the lack of nutrients and then blame vegansim like the balanced blond did.,NOT

hi trish i think its amazing you're going vegan if you can check out a book in your spare time the china study by t colin campbell is from my favorite biochemist anyway the vegan diet has completely changed my life for the better health wise  protein derives from beans lentils all fruits and veggies broccoli is packed!) if you don't like brussel spruts there are still so so more options for you you don't have to eat it if you don't like them ) definitely check out vegan youtubers and if you eat out there are many places with options for you 3,NOT
what is wrong with competing with males i get it you feel like a girl trapped in a man's body but why compete in women's division that doesn't mean that the society doesn't accept who trans people are it's just having a fair competition i mean steroids are illegal for a reason but they allow this hmmmm...,ABU

thanks for the great recap of a great year can't wait to see what 02 has in store for veganism and animal rights.,NOT
so i'm a straight cis woman but i'm aware i'm pretty masculine i don't know why but i have a lot of mannerism that seem more manly but i don't let it bother me when people call me out for it which people have i've always been one of the guys but i've always loved that and i'm glad i can hang out with guys and they don't feel like they have to act a certain way around me because i'm a girl i've always been a major tomboy but have i ever thought i was trans hell nah i'm perfectly fine with being a girl and on days when i feel like it i love to get dolled up and look my best in makeup and dresses have i ever had feelings for gay guys oh yeah my ex was even a closeted gay and i had to end that relationship because he cheated on me with my best friend's boyfriend but just because i'm masculine and i liked those guys before doesn't mean i wanted to be a trans guy just to be with them.,NOT
so by her logic i'm also a man? honey i'm sorry but no not wanting to wear makeup all the time and being assertive does not make you a man anymore than liking the colour pink and sewing makes you a woman.,NOT
i thought wage gap implies unequal pay for equal work this study seems to factor unequal working hours unequal choices etc how silly studies should be made on how there is wage gap for equally qualified equally hardworking equally risktaking equally available individuals of different genders,NOT
you have to be retarded or a liberal to think transgender boys to girls is fair oh wait liberals and retards are the same if this offends you you're the reason trump will win 020.,ABU
i'm so happy veganism is finally catching on in the mainstream.,NOT

omg i was waiting for this video,NOT
awwww i can feel freelee's happiness,NOT
going vegan is a lifestyle change so it will take a bit of time cut things out slowly so you don't go cold turkey and end up reverting back to eating animal products grains such as rice and quinoa and fruits and vegetables and beans are my go to's but there are so many vegan fake meats out there so if you're craving it go for that also oreos and diary free ben and jerry's are always there if you need a sweet fix!,NOT
is there a gender wage gap well yes but actually no.,NOT
i subscribed after the nd video i watched.. just to make sure it wasn't a one time deal in the late 0s i found myself with many gay friends and i would have considered myself a strong proponent for the gay community and for transgender people i served in the military for  years and i have met many gay sailors this was before don't ask don't tell i didn't agree with a lot of the rules etc i really don't think that a persons sexual preference is anyone's business and the gays that i knew . everyone knew and no one cared they were professional and were every bit a sailor some better than i was . a hetero fem one of my best friends was drag at night like i said no one cared in the 0s i used to get really pissed off at women in bars who would dance and make out with each other in bars to pick up men of course this was my opinion but lesbian and gays have fought the good fight for equality and here are women playing lesbian just for a one nighter i never asked a lesbian how they felt about that but for me i felt like it was a slap in the face of lesbians who have been locked in the closet but now it's cool to act lesbian to me it was making a mockery of the being lesbian like playing lesbian as a convenience to get what you want is ok to me it wasn't i may not be entitled to an opinion as i have not lived as lesbian or trans skip to the bathroom situation i am not sure about how schools handle it so i can't comment i fully supported same sex union i felt it was bad judgement for the lgbtq community to force the world marriage on mainstream i more than likely did not fully understand why they needed to use the term marriage in my opinion had the lgbtq community asked for something that should be legal for everyone to engage in a civil union for legal reasons like insurance custody etc. thing would be better for the lgbtq community today then the focus on transgenders and public bathrooms i think this whole mess really put the transgenders back to square one now society has the opinion that transgender some of the crazies i've seen in your videos like i told my friends back when obama was threatening roy cooper and the crap that went down in north carolina transgenders have been around for many many years and they have been using the wrong bathrooms and no one knew i honestly don't thank any truly trans woman has a beard or any facial hair from what i know about a trans male to female that facial hair would feel like acid on there face it just wouldn't be there miss white i had no clue you were trans just another beautiful girl i know there are some trans folks who have not had access to some of the medical treatments you may have had access to but if there are males transitioning to female there are many no medical things a person can do to alter your appearance i used to have a very short hair cut and i'm not for everyday very feminine so i have been mistaken as lesbian a few times i know this is a rant but i guess i'm writing because maybe someone will read this and understand that most main stream people don't hold hatred against lesbian gays and transgenders but the problem is that this has become twisted and perverted and this has became forced on the country and from experience i don't and i don't think anyone else wants to be forced to accept some of the things the lgbtq community is pushing anyway love your show and i wish you all the best and i appreciate that you have your show to educate folks like me and folks not like me!,NOT
and by just using your supposed common sense that you claim in this video to justify the gap then you are just judging a saw man and a needle woman in their ability to cut wood.,NOT

the wage gap isn't real women in general are less willing to go for higher paying jobs compared to men,NOT
women work less then men as a whole group so when you take an average women make less then men because they work less as a group,NOT
idk what to do because i feel awkward because one of my best friends other bests friend is transgender and she transitioned like weeks ago and i misgendered them bc i had no idea and now he hates me and my best friend thinks im a transphobe,NOT

there are certain occupations which are not considered as suitable due to cultural norms these are the ones where women are underrepresented as per the cultural norms women are believed to be caring and tender this is one of the reasons why women occupy significant share in nursing primary teaching human resources how is this about an individual's choice it's a much larger question of how society thinks of gender roles.,NOT
they make it seem like that is all there is to the wage gap though what they said s true some women do suffer from pure discrimination when it comes to how they are paid.,NOT
um who's gonna tell her,NOT
is this video old and prefilmed. cause korean bbq isnt vegan girl,NOT
"i can agree that flexible hours would help however who stays home with the kids is a decision couples make maybe women need to insist on working as many hours in their jobs as their husbands additionally you broke this down into simple categories which didn't even go into trade jobs or labor jobs) rather than specific jobs an example oncologists and neuro-surgeons or any surgeon is going to make more money by far than a general physician some one with a social science degree who goes into business is going to earn less money than a person with a degree in economics or straight up business this is because more people go into the field of social science than business hours worked is another factor the more hours you work even on a salary job the more likely all other things being equal that you will either get a raise or a promotion it also seems that men are more likely to ask for a raise than women or take the risk of leaving one job for another there are a lot of things which play into the earnings gap and it is an earnings gap not a wage gap same job worked same hours same number of years yields a far smaller or even nearly zero difference in pay it is imo disingenuous to call this a wage gap"".",NOT
blimp pilot and lion tamer :0 wtf xd,NOT
thanks a lot liberals lmao.. why are they being allowed to compete while doing gender hormone therapy?,NOT
yes trish!!!!!!! i have been on and off plant based for almost a year!!!! i am completely addicted to dairy and i have literal withdrawals so unfortunately i have always gone back to dairy i will never go back to meat though but seeing you doing this is giving me the motivation to do it too!!!! let's do this!! 😊😊,NOT
they are men competing against women!!,ABU
they were born male even though they feel their female they are boys and should be competing against boys they have an unfair advantage competing against natural born women.,ABU
hey trisha i'm so happy to hear this from you i do want to mention something you won't see drastic change in just weeks but me personally i've lost  pounds and kept them off in months and i don't go to the gym and i eat whatever i want vegan until i'm satisfied i hardly eat vegan junk food so please don't get discouraged if you don't see drastic change in weeks this lifestyle works you just have to give it time i also have recipe videos if you want some ideas i'm very proud of you for making the best decision of your life.,NOT
transgender girls??? now they are adoloscent boys.,ABU
if the wage gap exist why would businesses hire more men if they could pay women less if you could get away with this 7 cents to dollar crap then wouldn't all the women be hired first?,NOT
fuck you yearwood and your wife!,ABU
prageru once you factor in choice the wage gap shrinks to . cents me ok prageru the . cents only exists because of different choices me:🤨,NOT
u should just buy freelee's book,NOT
wait i'm confused so ur admitting that the wage gap is only the average of all women and all men and it's not the same job what's ur issue then?,NOT
they both just gays and like to dress like females,ABU
to earn a living you must be of value to get a job you must qualify for what they're paying you simple as that women have different priorities than men the label feminist is so overrated and even exploited by politicians and businesses when really it's just grown women throwing tantrums in a glorified way i'm probably going to be attacked if i say this i don't care about feminism focus on your mind your intelligence not just the fact that you have a vagina,ABU
this is a better way to look at it.,NOT
let me get this straight i'm not she wants to go through the entire process to become a male... just so she can dress up as a female?? i'm not hating or anything i'm just very confused on her thought process,NOT
while the gender pay gap may be exaggerated in some/many scenarios to prove a point this video neglects to mention anything on american work culture gender roles and previous cases of when employees of opposite sex but most identical profession responsibility and qualification receive noticeably different pay for their work for seemingly no other attributable factor and the legal action that has been effectively taken based on this,NOT
lol reminds me of when gerard way from my chemical romance says he'll use he/they pronouns on twitter a few years ago and people are still saying that makes him trans although he identifies fully as male and literally no one he knows irl ever refers to him with any other pronouns than he/him sounds legit huh?,NOT
to the lgbtq community do not get offended just point and laugh.,NOT
trisha paytas i'm lgbt everyone else which part trisha paytas yes,NOT
let's see how long it lasts,NOT
jeez this did a ton better than vox's video,NOT
this channel is sponsored by the zionist israel aipac biggest israel lobby in america to favour israel intrest before america  dont take my words search there videos regarding israel and found out for yourself america is controlled by the zionist jews ,NOT
this is coming from vox a left leaning channel keep that in mind.,NOT

bianca stanescu daughter just a weak bitch that cant be as fast as those girls smh all those people making petitions sensitive,ABU
won't last she was just crying on the floor over sean so you know she's going to run to her fatty foods.,NOT
i respectfully disagree with this i offer the anecdote that my wife managed a store and was paid less than a male in the same position even when she exceeded the seniority he had for background we are both politically conservative.,NOT
what feminists see is the percentage but people with a sense of logic see the actual implications of the data that provide the percentage women are more likely to choose jobs that pay less and they are more likely to take more time off through maternity leave this results in a lower pay yes not all women choose lower paying jobs and yes not all women get pregnant which impedes their pay but some do which is what changes their pay and by extension the averages that are used to receive the data for the percentage,NOT
regarding the lgbt community as a whole not every individual this is all part of the homosexual agenda you can be sure if not curbed it will weaken our entire nation i'm not at all hesitant to say i don't like them i don't and it's their fault for overstepping their boundaries more precisely for their insatiable lust for children i might seem to be off-base until you explore an alternate perspective they have developed an obsession with presumed authority first they presumed to tell straight people that because we don't understand them and because we are uncomfortable with their relentless effort to integrate some form of conveying the hey look at me i'm gay. message into everything they do we are mentally distressed and need counseling then they advanced to corrupting every television program with some form of homosexuality for example i turned on family guy one day the last show i watched regularly and suddenly stewie was gay to me in a modern family the grandparents are baby-boomers and parents have tattoos and a mind that is not stuck in a 930s time warp a boy with dads and no mom is my idea of a throwed-off family television stations do not have show directors to choose the shows they broadcast they have programming directors who choose the content with which they will program the audience children are a large part of the television audience the entertainment industry has no shortage of homosexuals there are even radio stations and probably television channels that broadcast only content from homosexual performers but if we try something like that they cry because we have violated their right to double-standards now their lust for children they have demanded the children of the nation which they cannot produce be taught there are more than genders not only that but they want to tell the other people's children they can choose their gender leaving a child at home alone is dangerous but it pales in comparison to teaching a child lies in school where they go to learn the truth but let's go on and tell the kids the many genders homosexuals have created in their minds are 00 as real as the that can be scientifically proven give the boys female hormones give the girls male steroids there's no reason a  year old girl shouldn't be taught how to put a condom on a life-like latex penis right that's how the state of california sees it are you starting to see their lust for children yet? do your best to convince yourself that will benefit the child as much as the sexually perverted pedophile give them all puberty blocking chemicals to allow them extra time to decide what they are honey if you identify as a toaster that's just fine daddy and daddy will still love you just as much as if you were a pixie or a fairy i believe in equal rights however when the population of an entire state is forced to accept the fantasies of the mentally ill as reality and abide by laws that mandate promoting the lgbt agenda by teaching children these people's delusions are reality while ignoring the majority of the population who actually produce the children that is far from equal and . rights what rights who gave them the right to lie to our children oh wait silly me it was obviously their fairy godmother so the result is that a champion female athlete is not only robbed of her status but robbed of her chance to earn a scholarship and maybe a better education than she can get without it because she has to compete against boys who want to dress like girls some girls might rely on a scholarship to go to college there have already been cases where girls in contact sports have been injured by boys dressing up as girls what's next you can be sure the girls are not the only victims though they're just the first to take a hard blow those boys are in the spotlight now but according to statistics dark times are just a blink away and all for what it is nothing but lust for new meat that motivates the lgb.. whatever they are this week to recruit children it gets even worse there is a new movement of people seeking to become part of the lgb... crowd they have labelled themselves maps are you ready for this minor-attracted persons that's the long way to go about saying pedophile. they believe it should be legal to . as long as they have the child's permission there was a time it was different but today the propaganda outright lies) the self-promoting content in every form of media and the aggressive recruiting campaign of the homosexual community has saturated every aspect of the nations children's lives thereby bringing them down to the same disgusting level as pedophiles they don't care if these kids will become so confused and frustrated that they'll rent a gun and buy a bullet before they reach 0 no i don't dislike them for their sexual preference i despise them for the negative impact the children will feel due to their selfishness lack of respect for the nation's youth and for their presumptuous attitude and actions.,ABU
this is.....what crazy looks like huh,NOT
i see so many you tubers claiming they're vegan' vegetarian etc because they want to save the animals and to make a stand against animal cruelty but then go and buy their makeup from mac its not cool.,NOT
"at this point or really any points of her career"") it's obvious that she's using the troll reputation because she knows that if it's too offensive and stuff there will always be those who will say she's just trolling and sweep it under the rug and she can comfortably gain views and clicks and whatever makes the money nowadays she's a troll is not an excuse explanation nor justification for her being a pathetic asshole.",ABU

hahaha yeah ok lets see how long this lasts,NOT
great video very succinct and informational allow to criticize one thing though i find ms summer's reading too noticeable to my taste when she speaks i look into her eyes and i don't feel like she's looking back at me but rather reading a wide sign above my head there needs to be a top-down scrolling reading platform under the camera or something even more suitable i don't know the correct name for that but feel free to tell me i believe that would make the video even more professional-looking.,NOT
feminists getting triggered.,NOT

"its whole food plant based period nothing else will save either your health nor the environment and dignity of the planet i have never experienced such long-term positive change in myself before and i instantly feel change for the worse when i start introducing sweets and bisquits and lots of bread and spreads xmas time..) as for the latter turning the anglophone public around is probably the only way to tackle this so we obviously have to go for fake meat etc anyway i started my plant based transition in december 016 and it was triggered first of all by vegangains in whose sources i instantly found dr greger which led me to neal barnard dr klaper and the rest of the cool gang. despite having seen various slaughterhouse documentaries most meanwhile unavaillable in yt in  years what the health and h.o.p.e being baby shit in comparison to some) it took the health argument to empower me of permanently eating plant based contrary to all my friends and family contrary to my physicians advice only one of my friends switched over to our side but fell back a couple of months later meanwhile i find that here and there i find people who at least sympathise with the plant based idea most educated women say i would if i could/if my husband would join"" men say things like don't touch these potatoe peels they are for my rabbits! some however pay credit for my consistency admitting they would like to be able to hop on the train also the climate argument came only later in 017.",NOT

i would love to do this as a business communications presentation in class but then my professor would hate me.,NOT
yay trisha i'm so glad you're going vegan the grapes are good but if you want a significant source of nutrients from them then you probably have to eat like one bag per day so i recommend not making the grapes into a meal but just having a few cups every day as a snack the bananas are good as well very good just make sure you eat them when they ripen because the bananas you showed in the video weren't ripe and that amount was good for like one or two days if you really want to go seriously then those will not be enough for one day technically you are supposed to eat at least  bananas a day so take that into mind also freely eats like two or three of those bunches for breakfast the carrots are a good source of vitamin a but you should use those more in cooking than eating them raw just because it's better to get all of your carbs in in the morning and then your vegetables are better later in the evening steaming the carrots corn green beans and other vegetables you like and pairing them with brown rice tastes very good watermelons are a good source of vitamin a c and will hydrate you but again the watermelon is better off as a snack and not a meal same with the cantaloupe most of the food you picked out is good for snacking and not really for meals you are going to want to pick up some dates mangoes potatoes brown rice almond milk or any other dairy substitute) pasta is good chickpeas and lentils it is definitely recommended you eat raw in the morning and most of the afternoon and then cooked food in the evening if you think eating raw is too hard then just throw it all the fruit you want in a blender add a shit ton of water some almond milk if you want and some coconut sugar if you want also look up vegan recipes you can have for dinner and maybe even some desserts if you want don't worry about overeating as long as you are eating fruits and vegetables because you can have as much as you want without gaining weight of course after eating you will be bloated but it will mostly be water and after urinating your belly will go down it's also good if you buy vegan multivitamins meant for vegans because if you are not very educated in nutrition you could end up with deficiencies i recommend the deva one-a-day multivitamin mineral i am glad you are taking this step and remember to eat if you are hungry and don't worry about calory intake you will not gain weight as long as you are eating right and remember always to carb the fuck up!,NOT
laughed x before the minute mark blaire white winning,NOT
the wage job does not exist,NOT
interesting video but it neglected to mention that men typically work longer hours and are as a group more economically productive over the course of their lives this means they contribute more to maintaining social systems than they get out of them because they pay more taxes so things basically even out in the end.,NOT

i didn't go vegan i went plant foods whole foods veganism is a religion i could care less if one slaughters cows pigs or goats goes fishing with a net crabs with a cage or cuts off the heads of chickens but i am sure vegans do and i bet 9 of them are pro choice because killing a baby is ok but don't touch my chicken its almost like vegans want to live in a perfect rain forest with chickens pigs goats cows and worms.. pisses me off they dont give a shit about humans health diabetes heart attacks and cancer..,NOT
just because you dress up as a male from a musical does not make you transgender also i wouldn't refer to anything or anyone as girly because that's not really the correct term i'd say feminine and yes trisha is very feminine and presents feminine identifying with males is a totally different thing identifying as a male is a whole nother thing my question is if you are an adult now and can do what you want then why are you not attempting to somewhat pass another thing is because you are a straight female you are going to be attracted to gay dudes because you are straight that does not make you trans because they're gay you have to have this thing called gender dysphoria something that all trans people have and you wouldn't definitely not even want to mention your chest if you actually had it because it's a very overwhelming topic for transgender people i should now because i am trans and also your gender identity and sexuality is not a choice just like the natural color of your eyes and skin you didn't choose that.,NOT

you can't work fewer hours more predictable schedules less dangerous jobs pursue lower paying careers sacrifice more time for children or other aesthetic reasons etc and still expect to be paid the same as a man who sacrifices family spends more time at work pursues more dangerous higher paying jobs is able to focus long stretches of time at career and spends less time with family remember women have higher rates of depression and suicide in similar careers as men that proves they're biologically less likely to pursue higher paying careers.,NOT
there is a grown ass man running against woman and dominating what is going on how is this ok,ABU
all you people dancing with joy that the wage-gap does not exist and feminists are wrong should re-think this whole situation women don't talk about this because they want the same pay for the same job cause that has been already dealth with and i mean sane women not idiots featured in buzzfeed videos reading the scripts they're given they just want equal treatment in the workplace that is the problem and the main reason why women are flagging up the disproportion in total earnings of men vs women the inequality exists because of women being expected to engage in the family life more than men that is one of the reasons imo it's the biggest factor) in today's society success is measured unfortunately but it's the truth by how much money you make and how great of a professional career you have it applies to both genders women feel like they will have a tougher time with accomplishing that kind of success than men and it is rightly so most of us men and women want to have children one day but for women having children means that their professional career will take a hit just to make this a bit more real one of my friends asked her boss why her colleague was given a promotion although she's been working for the company for a longer time she left out the fact that he's not as good at his job and the fact that he is a man she didn't expect that would be the reason and the answer was well you have two children at a young age so we thought giving you more responsibility right now could be damaging to your private life fun fact the guy also has two children at a very similar age of course my friend left that company thank god obviously that inequality is not men's or women's fault it's how our society is built but we should look at possibilities of dealing with that problem as increasingly women are just giving up having children completely the ageing society is already a huge issue that is progressing something needs to be done and as of now there are many people again both male and female that are not even acknowledging that the problem exists wake up people i tried to stress that no one who is a sane human being is blaming men for this it's not all of the men of this planet that should get together to fix this it's a problem of the society as a whole and we should try to deal with it that's all.,NOT
"i'm confused,is she female or male i don't understand",NOT

i don't feel that the problem is is dramatic,NOT
okay listen i'm attracted to super girly guys literally crossdressing is such a turn on for me as a woman does that make me a dude nah and you know why cause i wear jewelry and dresses.. that's it nah no duh it's because i'm comfortable being a woman and don't have dysphoria it's that simple and my boyfriend wanting to dress all girly doesn't make him a female because he's comfortable with his biological gender and doesn't have dysphoria :1 i have never heard it explained better.,NOT
trisha doesnt like labels also trisha do i think i'm trans yes a thousand percent do i identify with my natural born gender yes a thousand percent says right after saying shes both,NOT
u can get starbucks stuff with soy or coconut milk instead of reg milk,NOT
we have a shop called holand and barents and you can get vegan butter and manny things that are vegan and if you want protein i recommend you getting wheat grass and there are manny things that you can get and by being vegan you will feel more energetic and fit and there are a lot of vegan thins that you can get from holand and barrats,NOT
i'm a tomboy who works in a male-dominated industry and i identify as a female there's no way that overstuffed pink powder puff identifies as a male in anyway and i challenged it to come and do my job for a week,ABU
stop calling them transgender girls call it like it is boys dressing like girls unfairly competing in a sport they don't belong in . fucking sad really fucking sad .. they're parents are mentally fucking sick and retarded .,ABU
what that feeling is called is wanting views money and controversy this so awful to people who are really deeply struggling with actually transitioning.,NOT
it isn't just the hours women retire earlier which is the time in your career you typically make the most money men typically are more willing to take dangerous jobs over safe ones which is why we see more men as ice road truckers and more women as nannies men typically are willing to take more risks move accross country for a better job pish harder to negotiate their salaries etc there is so much that goes into this looking at this statistic is just plain misleading.,NOT
big shout out to all the liberal feminists out there you want to be equal to men well here you go.,NOT
yes this video is totally accurate and i agree with the whole idea but people saying that her first statement already destroys the myth does not make a lot of sense companies have a general idea that women aren't as valuable so they arent hired as much,NOT
exactly i should show this to my friend.,NOT
these arguments sound pretty familiar but pretty good video nonetheless!,NOT
and you're still a dude,NOT
🌱you're inspiring so many others to make the same change ,NOT
finally feminists are actually addressing this issue.,NOT
gigi we have to believe her blaire i'm gonna kill myself ,NOT
bravo!! a brilliant documentary film...i just wish i could get my family to sit down and watch this thank you pbn ✌👍👏🌿🌱,NOT
omffff im so proud of you omff i luv you yayy pleasse stay on this its amazing but if you don't that is completely fine you're amazing and just taking this step is amazing so your amazing,NOT
anyone else see ice cream taster as one of those high quality jobs that can lower the wage gap?,NOT
women also leave to have children which makes them riskier employees when in positions of power since you know eventually you will have to find a replacement to fill the position and also sets them back for several months per child or longer if they elect to stay home with it for longer.,NOT
can we just retire trisha to the farm now it's becoming inhumane to let her keep going on as she is.,NOT
"i wish instead she had said this isn't sexism it's capitalism""",NOT
you are literally garbage you are so disgusting for this you are cloutsexual b eing relevant turns you on and you are a fucking fiend!! they and them is confusing that sounds plural. fuck off you fucking actual troll you deserve every negative comment you get.,ABU
good for you girl always remember that veganism isn't a quick fix and that if you stick to it long term you'll have that amazing body and health forever  sending you my support ),NOT
bone structure and joints have benefit of  years of male they are physical males period the irony is that it is mostly women to blame for this absurdity women need to stand up and fix this problem this issue is making a mockery of hard fought for female achievement.,NOT

the top  richest people in america are men these men would highly inflate the wage gap,NOT

yeah she's eating meat again btw,NOT
except it really doesn't exist because if a man and a woman both work the exact same job have the same quality of work and the same hours they will get paid the same wage gap would only be a real problem if women were getting paid less for the exact same work that's just discrimination the wage gap only exists because of how they measure wage difference.,NOT
pinterest is amazing for recipes  been vegan for years and it's the best thing i've ever done bite size vegan is an amazing channel to look at!,NOT
mental disorders being supported as fairness smh,ABU
things not addressed that would be helpful for further research are there simply fewer women in the highest paying fields or do these fields pay more because they are male dominated in cases of change where more men go into traditionally-female fields such as teaching and nursing does this drive up wages across the board or just for male employees do both genders really have the same access to all professional fields or do recruiting hiring and training processes seem to favor one gender over another in certain fields ie is it a matter of simple choice or are our choices curated before they get to us how have increasing trends in women working in higher skilled educated fields impacted wages overall ie is there any evidence that wages go down in a field when more women enter it what differences in socialization based on gender impact things like negotiating wage applying for jobs which you don't necessarily have all the qualifications for etc.,NOT
because of the angry energy in the video i thought blaire was reacting out of feeling attacked by this so i did not expect her to make such good arguments well done girl!,NOT
"""to agree with a man that he is a woman is to agree with the schizophrenic that the voices in their heads are real"" and in that case you are encouraging and supporting insanity.. and that is wrong and disturbing in itself.",ABU
well done trisha if i was you i'd look up some accidentally vegan junk foods that you like now a lot of pringles flavours dark chocolate etc do some research and i really recommend getting pinterest there's so many great vegan recipes on there also hotforfood is an amazing youtube channel with tones of amazing recipes!well done on trying this lifestyle so wonderful cause you've such a huge influence ignore all the negative vegans and embrace us positive ones  also i wouldn't try to be super super healthy straight away maybe just do the vegan version of your current diet  and i wouldn't expect instant results this diet is slow and steady not a fad one you'll get there in the end and stay there ️❤ love your videos always make me smile ️🙌🏼,NOT
it's more like trasha paytis,ABU
u srs i can't make nearly as much money as an escort as a woman can,NOT
or we could just leave the wage gap as is and let women be dependents.,ABU
you should never eat a whole bundle of bananas just for breakfast...30g carbs in each.,NOT
your argument is based on raising children and that those children are raised by a women not sure we as a society should be okay with that conclusion.,NOT
if it was a man in this video there would be at least 0x more dislikes and sexist comments spammed in the comment section,NOT
the world is sick.,NOT
it's way unfair fuck you talking about???,ABU
these girls didn't even know that these two were transgender which makes this completely unfair for the girls and their families they should have been given a heads up at least so they could express their feelings on the matter girls can be as strong and as fast as boys if they put their hearts and minds to it being from texas its just something girls are taught from an early age at least my generation and the ones before mine were) girls play football with the boys here so different genders playing sports together is not a huge deal here its just the ignorance of not informing the other players and their families.,NOT
edgy as it may be but honestly we human should start selective breeding people with mental disorder like genderfluid whtathefuckkerry or feminazi should not be allowed to reproduce.,ABU
you can eat beans rice any veggies flax seeds) etc its actually a pretty easy diet but it takes time you just cannot eat or wear anything made from animals you cant wear leather btw but you can eat anything that is not an animal product good luck!,NOT
they miss it because it does not exist,NOT
raw till is great but most people love the high carb low fat hclf diet and i think you would like it as well getting all those carbs in throughout the day makes you feel and look your best remember to just eat when you are truly hungry and eat until you are satisfied/full because i know freelee preaches the whole smash in those calories thing but you actually can overeat so just listen to your body and everything will go smoothly!,NOT
...so because women don't want to work odd hours we should make ice cream shops and law firms close earlier that makes no sense a woman is just as capable as a man of working shitty hours if women don't think it's worth it that's their choice.,NOT
bro have u seen a psychologist im worried,NOT
the real question is.. what in the hell did trisha do to her lips did she stick them in a suction pump or something?,NOT

yeahh girl 3!! good luck going vegan changed my life in so many ways if you remember me like  years ago i was a mess although i photoshopped my pictures lol) in person i looked like i was falling apart i didn't realize i had a toxic effect from meat i just knew it always made me feel lethargic after eating it now i know i have a gene that gives me dna damage from smoked and cooked meat when certain chemicals are released) i am also lactose intolerant but was drinking milk anyway and have bad reactions to simple carbs processed sugar and preservatives.. i was 0 lbs heavier i had sleep disorders paralasis and nocturnal panic attacks) add mood swings cysts and a bunch of other issues. i had no idea how sensitive i was till i started eating clean i lost  lbs and i felt better than i have ever felt in my life no brain fog so much focus energy and people were telling me at  that i looked younger and better than i did at 1. it literally changed my life..beyond the little good karma vibes from knowing i'm doing a good thing for the environment/animals ,NOT

"""trisha the man paytas that's going to be my wrestling name now.",NOT
baby i support your gender identity but this does not sound to me like being a trans man however this does very much sound like gender-fluid identifying female sometimes male sometimes sometimes neither sometimes both.,NOT
run your ass into a car,ABU
the transgender issue is being pushed on us they want to created a genderless raceless religionless society.,NOT

freelee please help me! i am a  year old who is desperate to drop some pounds i weighed about 35-14 i'm '7 most of my teen years i moved across the country and gained a lot of weight and i didn't even change much with my diet or exercise routine my highest was 25 i have since then lost about  pounds because i started taking pills and getting shots by a dr but eventually the pills just made me sick i would like to get back to at least 3 again the extra weight has made me depressed and i resorted to trying a bunch of crazy and unhealthy ways to jump start weight loss i am a full time student and work full time i have tried to go vegetarian vegan so many times but i find myself reverting back to my old ways due to lack of time to really prepare my meals is there any info can give me to get into a healthier vegan lifestyle that wont be too time consuming to prep for?,NOT
"i think trisha needs a break from social media and yt to find herself and establish genuine love for herself if she puts absolutely no effort into transitioning she's not trans as many trans-femme or trans-masculine do they just get to dress up and play the part without actually putting in the effort so,no gigi you don't have to believe her until she starts showing signs of transition which she probably wont if she just said she's okay with her biological birth you can be a more masculine woman that makes you a tomboy not a man you can be a feminine guy you're probably gay..but you're not a woman.",NOT
a little late for this video dude.,NOT
hmm maybe people want meat/dairy substitutes because people actually need meat/dairy.,NOT

i'm vegetarian and veggie balls looks like meat balls but are not made of meat are one of my fave foods you can get them at super store i tend to bake them then put them in a frying pan with some vegetable oil to make them less dry then just add noodles or rice and veggies to sorta make a stir fry it's really good and i only need to make a little bit cause it's so filling anyways that's my tip also veggie dogs or veggie burgers are good too you can get them at super store as well),NOT
there was one thing that i think is important about the business type jobs too and that is that they are often more physically demanding jobs that women tend to shy away from.,NOT

these calculations may not indicate a gender-wage injustice as you said given that men are more likely to go into stem fields which pay more notwithstanding proving that these are poor ways to measure gender wage gap doesn't prove that there isn't a gender wag gap a better way to measure this would be compare hourly wages of men and women in the same profession and have been working the same number of years ,NOT
yes it is fair that your child be excluded because they are biologically a male.,ABU

this video makes a lot of sense to me however how do you respond to a feminist's counter that women are conditioned and socially gendered i.e oppressed to choose the less high-paying careers e.g girls growing up play house growing up taking care of dolls and etc - nurturing jobs or motherhood in other words a feminist would say that women do not have free choice because of society's conditioning how do you disprove that?,NOT
if women that are not care givers and single without kids are making less than a man then we have a problem i don't see why its such a big deal that a women or a man can choose to be the one that stays and takes care of kids during early child development kids are important and there should not be shame to those that choose to take care of the children women or men.,NOT

"this video is trying to prove the wage gap exists by saying wage gap over and over again.. while at the same time explaining what anyone with more than a double digit iq has been saying an earnings gap the video is explaining in a nutshell women couldn't work as much because their schedules dont fit the job. therefore there isn't a wage gap they are simply working less and earning less the men made more money because they worked more that isn't a wage gap no one is slashing cents off of your dollar you're simply not earning the dollar stop self validating your ridiculous feminist agenda with utter bullshit even when you're explaining something else you delude yourself into believing that you are instead justifying a conspiracy if i call it a wage gap enough times people will believe it!""",ABU
i agree with the general conclusion of the video...wage gap is not mainly due to sex but more about choices however there is still partial effect let's say % due to the fact that some managers could be women don't prefer to promote women to execute positions due to prejudice and stereotyping from personal experience wage gap is more apparent due to racial and religious differences rather than sex.,NOT

i dont really think there is a wage gap in the way people think i think men earn their increased pay compared to a woman unless it's an exceptional case of a boss or manager who is truly sexist but...there is a deeper problem women are led to believe they are weaker too emotional and too volatile all their lives women don't just compete against men but they also compete against women lots of women in power seem to see themselves as an exception and supporting another woman is threatening to their perceived special position as a woman so the wage gap ends up being because women are not striving as high as men but a lot of it is because of psychological manipulation to believe they arent good enough.,NOT
don't people realize there's no reason to fight the wage gap it doesn't exist because there's a law here in the u.s.a that doesn't allow that if you truly believe you make less than your male counterpart while doing the exact same hours and lev of work and same position as him etc etc then sue you can win.,NOT
this is a joke.. you can dress up all you want to facts are facts. it's unfair make three leagues... is this even a question...,ABU

many women choose to have children some don't exactly choose ofc depending on the situation but its seems very clear that the wage gap is a natural occurance due to the differences between men and women equality of opportunity does not always equal a mean equality of outcome that's not a nessisarily a bad thing men and women are different and that's the end of it be proud of your gender and strive to do well.,NOT

men are more likely to pick high paying jobs and women are more likely to pick low paying jobs within the statistics provided in the video) from that you could say that the higher paying jobs are more masculine and less feminine because of the choices females and males are more likely to make on average representing the different mind sets than the lower paying jobs and that our society tends to benefit masculine qualities over feminine qualities as a whole determined from those statistics also the title there is no gender wage gap is very misleading when the video proceeds to explain why there is a gender wage gap this argument comes across as very counter-intuitive one last thing genders occurred in our species long before we formed a currency in which to reward each other for jobs doesn't it seem strange we have worked ourselves into a situation as a species in which occupations that are mostly male dominated are going to get rewarded more than female dominated occupations over the duration of time we have been evolving with these delicate and influential minds problems like these have inevitably been emphasised and expanded from our initial nature and we should probably fix it.,NOT

almond milk rice tofu hummus more vegetables lentils and i'm sure you can find more things/recipes online good luck!,NOT
of course the boomers are against veganism like okay boomer.,NOT
freelee can you also make videos for trish focussing on how eating animal products not eating enough plant foods and not eating a steady supply of healthy energy fucks up her mental health this would be a big one for her too going vegan helped me so much with my mental health problems simply because of the reduction of inflammation in my body the loads of nutrients from plants and the steady supply of glucose to my brain i mean i know you know what i mean because you have experienced the same it's time trish got some relief from her mental problems.,ABU
'i have always had penis envy because i think my life would be easier if i had that part...' bless her heart...,NOT

yes this is incredible trisha❤ two weeks is still wonderful you go girl love ya,NOT
i think trisha is trying to figure herself out. maybe not the best way/right way but i can tell she's conflicted with her internal and physical self hope she figures it out.,NOT
men are also more competitive and ask for more promotions and raises men work more hours than women overall.,NOT
their running on the girls team because they are too slow if they competed on the male side they would be like th place! what a disgrace to real woman athletes now they have to deal with this bullshit when will this insanity end this has nothing to do with not accepting transgenders this is just common sense when they said they should run faster i wanted to punch him her in the face can your fake breast make milk?? just try harder to make milk!! they look huge with broad shoulders and legs that are long and thick but no they are girls gtfo,ABU
there's is an income inequality gap and that gap is getting bigger that's the real threat to american stability.,NOT
i love freelee i love this video but she is an actual psychopath,ABU
honestly this is one big reason why i have such a problem with all of the extra genders people come up with they're supposedly fighting against gender norms but creating these new genders is basically saying if you're a guy with these feminine traits then you shouldn't be identifying as a guy and things like that it actually reinforces gender roles by saying you're only a guy if you act like a stereotypical guy and you're only a girl if you act like a stereotypical girl like no when i hung out with guys as a kid and tried to fit in with them that was just called being a tomboy nothing more it's really not a big deal until you start throwing in all these extra genders and specifications on what it takes to be a specific gender,NOT
pause at exactly :39,NOT
how can any rational person not consider these two have an unfair advantage,NOT
"you go trish👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏 load up on carbs pasta,bread,potatoes etc that will keep you full and you won't have to eat as much or as often❤ for protein beans are amazing! make sure you have food ready so when you cook make huge batches ",NOT

lool at :3 she just made a gender comparison and stated that it wasn't sexism just common sense common sense is probably why more women chose unfortunately i don't think individuals really have a choice in social environments they are in.,NOT
jesus keep the genders separate in sports females and males have a different anatomy its still a handicap for all the female athletes now those females tracker runners who were trying hard to win scholarships just got cheated out of a future with opportunity.,ABU
vox please state the actual gender gap you dont mention it at all it's about 3-97% it's rather small almost insignificant,NOT
i want you to be aware that some people start off pretty rocky when they first go vegan from either not being sure what to eat and how much or from your body cleansing its self once you start a healthy diet your body wants to release all the junk toxic food you have been eating before and that's why people feel tired sick gain weight etc and it gets mistaken that veganism is doing that to your body but really it's the food you ate before releasing just stick with and you'll feel amazing!! and get great results this is what happened to me in the beginning but i kept going and adjusting to what worked for me and i'm soooo glad i did because it was one of the best decisions of my life!!!! almost every problem i struggled with mentally and physically) wishing all my luck towards you trisha❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,NOT
this was actually pretty good well reasoned out for a minute video vox has done some pretty bad videos about similar subjects previously but this one seems like a return to form.,NOT
i have been vegetarian for almost two years my goal this year is to be completely plant based i'm super excited i not only feel better when i dont eat meat or dairy but happy knowing that a precious animals life was not taken for such a selfish reason i have always loved animals but not eating meat has really opened my eyes to how beautiful and pure these creatures are they deserve better and i talk to so many people about not eating meat i only hope to help change people's lifestyle that are destroying this beautiful planet we have.,NOT
this shouldn't be sensitive at all it's biologically unfair!,ABU
can you please change the title of this video to trish goes vegan for  minutes this was such a lie she is eating chicken and waffles in her snapchat.,NOT

more steaks for me i love burning gas in my monster truck,NOT
theres already laws that make paying women less illegal and you can sue companies for doing so so why arent you taking them to court? and why do you think another piece of paper reiterating a law already in place is going to do anything dumbass,NOT

ok really people quit being rude it is her choice for how long she is and u never know she was vegan and she filmed this and was gonna start after she posted the video and i think it is amazing that she wants to take better care of her body and i'm proud of her and all u haters should just shut up,NOT
okay i hate trisha shes basically rachel dolezal on crack who hung out too much off of western ave and south virgil after getting slapped by ms1 in gang bangs too much that needs to be dicked down by many men on pornhub thats all shes worth,ABU
that lack of intersectionality though,NOT
about time someone put up a video that shows truth,NOT
gasp i'm going vegan for weeks as well!! and hopefully forever.. i just hate watching documentaries about how people treat the animals so i failed the last time i went vegan i was hooked on being vegetarian after i saw documentaries so that's all what i got to do i recommend you watch one when you're at the point of giving up it really helps keep educating yourself trish love you ,NOT
clutural marxist propaganda,NOT

i think sports doping rules needs to change!!! natural born women should legally be able to take testosterone to level the playing field.,NOT
i think this is completley idiotic idk i think you should just stick with ehat you are and never try to be somet you aren't.,NOT
my mom simply stays home and actually takes her of her kids kids need a lot of attention but also restrictions to develop properly women are just designed to care for their kids breasts...) i don't want to say that women shouldn't be able to work but if they decide for a kid they should be able to invest time into their kids and not be forced to put them in a crèche many people have problem with the teenagers today and i think a partial reason for that is parents spending less time parenting i'm 6 diligent and smart and i think part of that is because my mom set me rules because that's what a kid needs before it is able to realize itself that watching tv all day is a bad idea hrm...usa..hrm),ABU
lol i just had to laugh at the man who works longer hours but ends up sleeping at the desk ohhhh man.,NOT

she should pursue a career as a dominatrix and get back to us in a few months to see how she feels lol,ABU
some milli vanilli lookin mfer,ABU
there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap though but that is entierly up to the induvidual it is illegal to pay women or men less based on their sex so if someone is being paid less and can prove it is because she is a woman or because he is a man then take it to court and sue their asses.,NOT
when i went vegan for and a half weeks i literally ate so so much not because i was hungry because my meals were so filling that they lasted me from each meal to the other i just liked snacking on stuff out of boredom yet i still lost pounds a week and also before i went vegan i had problems with an extreme slow metabolism and i was overweight when i stopped being vegan i struggled so much to get back into the routine of no snacking so that i didn't gain too much weight i gained a couple of pounds but i found becoming vegan so easy it was stopping it which was hard my metabolism is still good from it though also my fave dinner was jacket potato with kidney beans in chilli sauce it's chilli con carne in a tin with no beef and salad as a side.. yum and so so easy and filling  good luck,NOT
“allege unfair advantage” they're men.,ABU

say no to equality of outcome kids equality of outcome is bad mkay,NOT
summary the title of the video is a lie there is a 3 wage gap between men and women but women make different choices than men when calculating for women's choices the wage gap is smaller at only .6%.,NOT
can you vlog everyday at least to show what your gonna eat and what types of activities you gonna do?!?,NOT
so what you're saying is that because of the disproportionate amount of women in lower paying fields and/or raising children working less or innumerable other circumstances that prevent them from working in higher wage employment or recieving bonuses or raises statiscally speaking the wage gap doesn't really exist.,NOT
this is what milo yiannopoulos ben shapiro and the alt right have been trying to say for like the last years,NOT

no they shudnt this is madness why cant ppl be their gender and stop this nonsense you are born a male therefore u are a male take all de hormones u want u will be biologically male till death.,ABU
who knew the gender which evolved to be as useful and competitive as possible turned out good at doing stuff and working hard weird right?,NOT
so basically what freelee is saying is she's going against everyone who isn't vegan,NOT

lets unpack this so im transgender diagnosed dysphoria transgender the fact that she is called herself trans when she obviously is not is sickening it hurts the trans community being trans is a mental disorder not a game of fucking dress up wow you were more tomboy as a kid that doesn't male you trans the fact that she has to compensate of how shes still feminine by saying that since shes a gay man that we like more frilly things i beleive that when it is a cis male but when you are a transgender male you will want to pass as such you wont want to look girly because being misgendered hurts trisha needs to get it throigh her thick skull that this is not okay being trans isnt dress up being trans is where your brain and body dont match up hers matches up just fine this has me fuming you arent trans if you dont have dysphoria trisha you arent passing as male that is a key thing to a transgender male you are a grown ass women who needs to stop playing dress up and hurting a community you arent apart of.,NOT
definitely unfair 00 those are born men no matter what you identify as your gender your biological make up is what you are at your cellular level please stop this madness.,ABU
i'm just a high school kid you makes youtube videos on gaming i saw this video as an ad and was about to hit skip but man it was so factual and mind blowing that i had to find the actual video and give it a like i was raised to believe the wage gap myth but now your video has shed light on me and brought me into a new perspective on economics i wouldn't have ever been taught that information in school and for whatever reason i was interested in hearing more as she went on nice content i won't sub because it's not my style on youtube but it's nice to know that there's very interesting things on youtube other than the content i normally digest thanks.,NOT

i agree with everything you said except for when you said that if you think someone isn't lgbtq you just shouldn't call them by their preferred pronouns and name or believe them when they say they like someone i've thought that people have faked it before and i was wrong so i always just try to be respectful if they aren't hurting anyone i don't care who you like or what your pronouns are i've some out to people i thought were friends and they said i was faking and i'm not and people have said that i'm faking having anxiety for attention when i actually go to therapy and have real problems also the part when you said that celebrities just come out to get more famous one person i can think of that didn't do that is brendon urie from panic at the disco he came out as pan he donates to lgbtq charities and he had the highest hopes foundation he also sings girls/girls/boys at all the shows not everyone just wants to come out to be interesting some people just want their fans to understand them more and feel not as alone sorry for my rant thanks for coming to my ted talk,NOT

the comment section is just as idiotic as you would assume.,NOT
4:0 you cannot be attracted to a sexuality that doesn't make you trans because you're fetishizing a sexuality you can be attracted to feminine men though honestly though this whole video just contradicts itself goes against science and is offensive in so many different ways.,NOT
i had a teacher in high school help explain this to me she had two children for both children she of course had to take time off of work and while her and her husband are both teachers with their doctorates in education when they retire he will end up having earned more money then her why is that because for each child she had to take roughly a year off work having her salary cut in half while her husband continued to work a big issue mentioned in this video is that women are still responsible for most of the household duties even with full time jobs ever hear of a father on paternity leave” if the responsibilities were more equal maybe the pay gap would decrease yes in most jobs men and women will get paid the same amount of money if not there would be an even bigger uproar about this inequality its the longterm issues that the pay gap is about imagine having to try to divide or attention and priorities between work and your children evenly while your gender counterparts dont have this issue.they can automatically place their attention on work giving them a leg up in the workplace raising a child is a team effort and what kind of team mate leaves you with all the heavy lifting just to claim the gold medal not saying this is the case for every family but the statistics say its the case for a lot.,NOT
moving just a little off topic the worst paying jobs you mentioned should be higher paying they are incredibly important jobs especially teaching and we should be trying to make pay fair for all of them it's not a sexist issue but it would mean women will start to earn a bit more.,NOT
i have been vegan for only month and i am confused where the hell i was before? best decision ever !!!,NOT
obama was a community organizer...,NOT
if i could pay a woman 1 less to do same amount of work as a man then all men would be unemployed end of story.,NOT
i think you should perhaps rethink what her message was i don't think comparing it to being transgender or your transgender experience is entirely accurate just because i don't think she knows exactly what the term is but regardless she is struggling has hinted towards it for years and it does a lot more harm than good by invalidating someone else's difficulties just because it doesn't seem to make sense she used the wrong terms and comparisons yes no doubt that's more than likely due to ignorance but beyond that she clearly is really hurting and if she's felt this inside since being little...well it's no ones place to take that from her.,NOT

so.. there is a wage gap it's just much smaller than people advertise and it relates to a variety of thing that are much more complex than just gender and sexism?,NOT
the 7 cents for every dollar story is obviously not the point discrimination happens before wage realizes and works exactly by influencing the choices this video talks about this is something you can hardly change through legislation we need a culture of equality!,NOT
the wage gap is probably due to kids women typically work less hours to care for kids afterwards they may put more effort into the workplace.,NOT

transgender should compete against transgender wtf is this,ABU
she either is  just doing it for attention  literally delusion as hell and needs help i think she has sexuality and gender mixed up she has shown zero signs of being trans her reasonings to being trans are a joke i am not one to say who u can and cannot be but come on.. she's making trans people look like a joke trisha has been needing serious psychological help the back lash she will/has received from that video is going to change her life forever personally i think she is ignorant on the subject and has sexuality mixed up with gender adding on she has a lot of mental issues that she doesn't know how to control so pushing it on the i'm transgender is the easiest way for her adding on the whole attracted to gay men they are still men shit i like girls and i can see a girl who is lesbian and think she's attractive but that doesn't mean i'm lesbian it still would be heterosexual of me she needs help lastly masculinity doesn't make you male it is a spectrum.,ABU

this is the kinda of reaction she wants it knows any publicity is good publicity,NOT
i'd hesitate to even call them girls without at least adding the word transgender in front) they were born black men ergo naturally stronger and faster they have testosterone flowing through them putting on a wig and a sports bra and taking a couple shots of estrogen does not instantly make them girls nor does it grant them the right to be treated as such these confused peculiar men have an unfair advantage and they know it and these poor girls the real ones can't do anything about it.,ABU
i've worked in industry for 0 years aerospace logistics and it and the only sex based bias i have found involved moving what few women there were into managerial positions i think this is because the few women they had to choose from when hiring were pretty incompetent and really most of them were worse than useless at the technical side of things they had no choice but to move them into management.,NOT
gender fluid definitely not transgender i'm sorry,NOT
you cant just eat fruits and veggies to be vegan you will have lots of health problems you need to eat grains and proteins and things that will fill your stomach longer than  minutes you should read up on veganism more and watch some meal prep kalel is a really good example she has amazing vegan meals and shes a devoted vegan ),NOT

stop humiliating yourself your pathetic just stop youtube you don't deserve this platform everyone likes to have views but this is a new low your disgusting and vile you're an embarrassment she is jumping on the bandwagon.,NOT
beans have a lot of protein and other nutrients eat a lot of greens for vitamins along with your fruits also nuts can be a good source of calories freelee is an extreme case she has a fast metabolism most likely but more importantly she's very active so she has to eat a lot of carbs for normal people who drive around the city all day you can't just eat a bunch of carbs and think you'll get thin a lot of people becoming vegan eat too many carbs because they use starch as a replacement for meat starchy foods have a lot of calories and they turn into fat if you don't use the energy immediately you should check out the unnatural vegan's channel here on youtube she has good advice and supports everything she says with evidence which a lot of other vegan youtubers don't or they think anecdotal evidence is sufficient when it's not. i think being vegetarian is enough for me but i end up eating vegan pretty often i'm mostly concerned about the environment though i also don't eat meat because i can't support killing animals for food in good conscience so it always brightens my day up a bit when someone wants to be vegetarian or vegan good luck trish hope this finds you _^,NOT

i think she's genderfluid and androsexual attracted to masculinity but she's just really confused and needs some help badly,ABU
trisha has been known for trolling yes but she also has been known for emotional unstability and numerous identity crisis i think she has always wanted desperately to feel like she belongs and that explains why she tries to insert herself in the lgbt community in absurd ways do i think she's trans hell no do i think she is legitimately struggling and needs to put some sort of label to it yes i think she believes she's trans and i think she believes that because she needs a concrete answer to a life-lasting issue.,NOT
a few selfish people are ruining women's sports verry self absorbed people,ABU
hi trisha get sweetened soya milk instead of milk. milk xxx,NOT

how does a man know he feels like and therefore wants to be a woman how does he know what a female feeling feels like asking a man to describe female feelings is like asking a blind person to describe color what's the perceived difference between male and female feelings anyway if we can agree that there's no definition on feelings and their connection to your biological sex is it about the physical manifestation of gender do trans men just want their own boobs and vagina to play with and to go into womens toilets are they homosexuals that can't face reality and believe finding men attractive must make them women i'm interested to learn.,NOT
she reminds me of a fcking dinosaur!! like her face yells im part t-rex or sort of flared nostriled snapping turtle!! she just soooo.. oh my point shes boring and doing dum shit that triggers people to keep her relavent b.c really shes a nobdy if she doesnt say dum shit.,NOT
good for you girl tips be open to the fact that the vegan version of foods isn't supposed to taste exactly like the animal version chicken nuggets are their own delicious treat as is coconut yogurt soy milk soy cream vegan cheese vegan cookies also most bread pizza dough crackers etc are vegan if you want delivery pizza order it with sauce and veggies and add your own vegan cheese or toppings at starbucks ask for soy milk or coconut milk instead in fraps or any drink sorbet ice cream is dairy free oreos are vegan there is a vegan version of just about any food and it's fun to try also there are so many vegan tumblr blogs with a ton of ideas and simple recipes that really helped me when i went vegan finally do it at your own pace if you have a set back and eat an animal product don't condemn yourself and let it turn into a binge forgive yourself and continue on hugs xo,NOT

i thought i noticed a bunch of bologna when i heard about this in my economics class.,NOT
sure the estrogen treatments will bring the testerone levels down but even with that they're still going to have a lot more testerone in their bodies than the average female walking around a lot more and then of course you have the difference of bone structure so of course they have an advantage they're men saying they're transgender or taking estrogen doesn't change that their chromosomes are still xy and always will be god bless them and i hope one day they come to the truth.,ABU
if you are comfortable with the gender you were born with.. you aren't trans.,NOT
freelee you should use your voice and make a video about marina joyce!,NOT
it's sad that people are comming out for clout and they never come out as gay or lesbian they come out as some made up sexuality/gender.,NOT
trisha seriously needs long term professional help that is all i can even think to say i just...can not understand how she's popular.,NOT

i think communism warned us...,NOT
we need to remove wrong theories from children's books which say we are top of food chain and we are omnivores it's wrong we are herbivores naturally we have small and curved canine teeth not long and sharp like omnivores and carnivores,NOT
"veganism is a lifestyle what you wanna do is called a plant-based diet"".",NOT
she is a fruit-fly a woman who lusts after gay men all the time.,NOT
eat lots of potatoes and rice and beans,NOT
i think you identify in being nuts😜,NOT
this is true on the whole however circumstances are everywhere i must contest to that point.,NOT
i would reccomend you to not only eat fruits ang veggies eat pasta rice potatos etc too) also if you do eat any animal products by accident don't beat yourself up or give up it's so important because if you beat yourself up about it you are likely to just give up and also eat when you're hungy your body is telling you that you need food so give your body food i love you so much trisha and i love that you are doing this hope it sticks with you best of luck,NOT
you know what i would call this a tom boy somtimes and a girl girl sometimes because what i heard was you like man hair and being a little more guy ish but maybe that's just me i hope you can figure it out t i really hope you find someone you care about and they care and except you ❤️,NOT
didn't trish say she smoked meth before.. i'm not trusting anything she says.,NOT
hey i was born a man but upon further stupidity i now identify as a fart so please dont hate me just accept my stupidity ,NOT
they will forever biologically have an advantage over females it's definitely unfair,NOT
"it doesn't matter whether or not she's trolling or if she'll stick with it if we treat her kindly with respect and thoughtful support if we help educate her and encourage her not only will trish be more likely to really stick with the plant based diet and hopefully cut out animal consumption in other areas of her life but it helps spread the message to all of her audience so her followers can see that vegans aren't crazy pushy freaks but are actually just concerned people who want to help animals that could help a lot more people go vegan than just attacking trish for oh she's just trolling oh she can't do it"" lets remember to extend our compassion to everyone!",NOT
lol i thought she was going vegan forever and then she said two weeks p like gurll clickbait,NOT
in what jobs women earn more money than man there must be some,NOT
ok i'm reading lots of comments about how a teacher makes less than a ceo clearly people didn't watch the video it's about fir the same job a ceo would definitely make more the argument were making is for the same job don't get butthurt about my opinion it's what i think.,NOT
trish male female gay straight bi i'm all of it trish i dated bi people me okay trisha ,NOT
since child labor laws exist the median earnings per year for year olds is around zero dollars but the median earnings for adults is over zero dollars so there is an infinity wage gap there,NOT
1/2 men are expected to die in a work related accident each year but we don't care about that now do we lol.,NOT
it's unfair you are still a boy.,ABU
they should compete against boys,ABU
nowhere in the constitution does it say that we have to play along with the make believe games of others you can play those games all you want but none of us have to accept them.,ABU
i go out without makeup too trisha makeup is expensive i'd rather look like a crackhead in front of my client's dogs than use up all my sephora eyeliner in a week.,NOT
the first thing i thought when i saw trisha's video was i hope blair makes a video on this” you're always on it sis.,NOT
i'm not vegan but slowly heading that way as well.there are great pasta recipes on pinterest online etc if you have a craving for ice cream i suggest bananas almond milk to preferred thickness top with sliced almonds vegan dark chocolate for antioxidant benefits and coconut chips sooo good also sweet potatoes with corn chili powder cumin chives and whatever other veggies you like  soo good.,NOT
people don't have to understand for you to be valid i hope you don't take the ignorant comments on this video to heart much love and keep doing what makes you happy ,NOT
the .6 figure for unexplained gender wage gap determined by the aau is cherry-picked for starting salary the gender wage gap grows to 5 by the time people are in their mid-30s.,NOT
i'm confused because it seems that the outfit you're wearing and hair etc is the same as when you went to shane's premiere? and since then you've been eating meat etc???,NOT
good for you don't let freelee know though she might feel threatened and try to take your channel down as she's doing to others,NOT

“they get to do as they want pathetic these dudes can run track in the men's track!,ABU
this video must be from a while ago....,NOT
i like raw meat from animals fed on grassland which is the most natural and ecological way of producing food without man-made fertilizer herbicide and antibiotics ,NOT
“this is vodka by the way  blaire keeps it so real and hit every point perfectly yes girl!,NOT
man i think she/he is just confused ab her/his gender he/she doesn't have to like going by they/them but he/she should take some time to figure shit out.,NOT
i'll take these facts on the chin for now but i would like to see references put either in the video or underneath it so i could look up the facts and quotes myself,NOT
why can't you put your sources of information in the description so i can actually take you seriously.,NOT
remember that if you get cravings for meat or dairy there are tons of vegan options! vegan junk food yaaassss🙌🏼 congrats trisha!!!,NOT
the weird part of youtube again...,NOT
the wage gap isn't real there hasn't ever been a study that proves it's real that takes into account education years worked experience hours worked maternity leave and ot the only study that was conducted showed that women fresh out of college made more than men who were fresh out of college,NOT
i think she was trolling,NOT
and make it so men are able to and feel more obligation to share the home and parenting workload with their partners.,NOT
the cis white lady privilege and ignorance jumped out,NOT
i got an ad for you on the video,NOT
im so excited for frelees video on this,NOT

um theology and religious vocations as worst paying jobs look throughout history the church is one of the biggest money traps average salary for a priest at one of those mega churches in the u.s is 00k.,NOT
bender in that futurama episode predicted this shit this is highly unfair and robbing opportunity for female future to participate or at least try out for the olympics put their asses in the boy's division to see if it makes a difference.,ABU
i like cake...!,NOT
realistically they should compete against males not females,ABU
she has mental illness.,NOT
the question now is why do woman go to the worst jobs this question isn't over,NOT
this garbage is going to ruin women athletics i have a daughter a real girl i hope she never has to deal with this crazy liberal supported idea that it's okay for boys to compete with girls it's fucking wrong on so many different levels how about be the first transgender to win a state championship against the boys now that would be impressive.,ABU
i think she's just reaching for content,NOT
close your eyes and listen to the voices -- male and male.. leave the girls alone,ABU
when you trying so hard to stay relevant 😂,NOT
i know it's not healthy but u can get vegan cinnamon rolls,NOT
it's actually really common for people to gain weight when they first go vegan/vegetarian because their body is used to being deprived of nutrients from calorie deficiency dieting starving yourself) and is still storing everything as a fat reserve your body will adjust within a month or so of normal eating sufficient calories carbs and nutrients and plateau at a certain weight then you'll start losing it best way to combat the initial weight gain is to drink a lot of water and exercise daily 4 min of cardio is a good starting goal) just mentally prepare that you'll gain a bit of weight before you'll begin losing it because of your dieting habits  good luck oh and also root chips leaf cuisine spreads bomb it's healthy probiotic chips and dip and it can be used instead of creamcheese  it's vegan and dairy free if you want to substitute soda try kombucha as well ],NOT
i tried to bring these points up apparently statistics and logic are sexist.,NOT
so she's both genders?,NOT
eat as much whole plant food you want fruits veggies grains beans you can eat vegan junk too but if you're looking for aesthetics stick to whole foods and drink a ton of water!!,NOT
first time i see vox slightly nudging the liberal agenda instead of going all-out leftist nicely done.,NOT
i agree luv trisha but im finding myself slowly moving away from her with all do respect if she truly is with i think she isn't at the moment transgender... i will support her unconditionally but using the trans community for views and attention is never okay and it is something trisha is prone to doing jumping onto trends and saying random ass shit for views.. xyz. but at the end of the day nobody defines the transgender every body is different and responds to figuring themselves out in a different way there are male to female straight women male to female gay women male to female a+ and the exact same for female to male she has every right to come out... but definitely has no right to use being trans for growth it truly can be either or we all know nothing is yet to be confirmed i know this is all over the place but i just don't know how to explain my opinion in another way than this in conclusion..... we'll see.,NOT
i'm confused on my gender i want to say that hey i'm trans and i'm a boy but at the same time i'm not completely 00 about it,NOT
not fair at all ..,ABU
i've been telling people that  cent bullshit is a totally misleading statistic for years,NOT
why are we even paying attention to trisha paytas all her vids are just attention whoring or a cry for help.,ABU
don't forget though the common response to lower wages being on account of a person's choice is that women aren't really free to choose what they want like men are.,NOT
go watch nina and randa they are vegan and do what i eat in a day they could really help you find foods to eat.,NOT
why do they always point to women doing the majority of child raising like men need to do halve that work to on top of the fact that they never say yes women do most of the child raising and that's because men still pay either though taxes/child support ect the majority of the cost of child raising.,NOT
ellen g white said in the 800's that the world will run with the health message except for seventh day adventist.,NOT
it's not just common sense but also reality.,NOT
also its easy to find vegan thai food and sushi oreos are already vegan so u can eat those look up vegan fast food orders too not the healthiest but everyone gets tempted when u go to a fast food restaurant so it's good to have an order down so u don't cheat,NOT
"don't have the mindset of i need to surround my meal around the meat""",NOT
earnings doesn't equal wage earnings gap is explained as fake if hiring women was cheaper men wouldn't be employed.,NOT
vox should break this down in how it improves the lives of insecure driftless and unambitious males especially whiney white guys that think that being on the starting lineup of their hs football team is enough to score a hot chick except that it doesn't it takes an age old power from domineering entitled men in that if he knocks a girl up she's his and she will have to depend on his income and he will have most of the power in the household with women and men making similar wages in jobs that don't require college these woman no longer need to marry or even stay with shiftless men unfortunately a lot will still sleep with them and with birth control access varying from state to state sometimes that still ends up in babies that can link you to a car wreck for forever ugh then these sons having bad or no example of a good male role model assume super macho attitudes and just keep on continuing the cycle sad and pathetic.,NOT
feminist that don't actually want women's rights and only want to boost their ego make it look like that the gender wage gap is a huge thing which it is but they overexxagerate and oversimplify it which makes it harder to understand for people who don't know about it.,NOT
how hard could it be to have an apples to apples comparison base pay rate comparison of same profession of same company male vs female.,NOT
maybe its meant for a better collab to be made:d,NOT
they miss that it dosnt exists,NOT
i'd like to have a long ass talk with trisha about how gender and sexuality works she needs to figure this out bcuz she seems so confused to a point shes saying strange things,NOT
why would people dislike this feminist wow i hate this video because it shows women are the same as men,NOT
no one absolutely nobody at all not a single living thing in the known universe trish 'anyone who uses they/them pronouns has mulitple personallities'',NOT
my mom had a solution for my dad not pulling his weight around the house she stop doing laundry and got a job so my dad became a stay at home dad…,NOT
so funny about all these rah rah comments  none of you all give a sh*t that women earn so little you're like who cares if their full time jobs don't earn sh*t it's their choice to teach our kids maybe get shot) wipe our grandpa's butts help get the homeless drug treatment shelter stay home a while with a man's children suckers. are your values all about the market?,NOT
still love u tho,NOT
try chickpeas green beans lentils tofu/tempeh you can still eat wheat or rice noodles/pasta. literally any food you normally would but don't add the animal products. not the healthiest maybe that's what i do use random veg/spices/fruit to make curries or in soup/stir fry x,NOT
if they allow this they should allow doping for the girls.,NOT
you just need to make sure to eat enough you can eat as much as you want try to stick to raw foods) and you may even need to count calories just to make sure your body is getting enough food this is amazing proud of you!!,NOT
the thousand ppl that disliked this vid are women,NOT
she did a very good job of explaining this topic!,NOT
stay as far away from freelee as you can they've pulled so much shit since she was at your house it's stupid she's an actual criminal she turned a few million ppl against veganisim from her casey niestat video alone trisha she will back stab you.,NOT
"come on you want to get rid of schedules just so that wives can be worked to death easier why can't we just work to create an environment where women don't feel like they have to be a slave to their husbands there's no reason they should take the majority of the work raising children unless they want to that is but still i don't like the idea of saying oh you want to work two jobs give up on all your dreams slave away in the kitchen while your husband and children watch tv okay then let's help you make that possible"".",NOT
that's great  i'm a vegan too technically a junk food vegan i lost so much weight:),NOT
this also forgets to mention that there are far less women then men to get tech and engineering degrees and that is by choice of the individual women themselves you dont see a ton of men going into nursing because its not what a vast portion of men want to be doing women dominate nursing because a lot more of women value that field of work and lets face it some fields of work are more profitable then others.,NOT
"sooooo what are your pronouns then i'm so confused lol someone explain this to me also what did trish mean when she said you can be everything all at once"" like im pretty sure you cant be lesbian gay bi trans nb ace and everything else all at once.....",NOT
i also gained soooo much weight after i stopped eating meat because i also replaced all the meat with food that wasn't so good for me  i'm just now starting to lose it but i do feel the best i've ever felt despite all of the weight i've gained lol,NOT
wow i did not expect to see a rational examination of this issue from vox pleasantly surprised to see the wage gap isn't because of the sexist patriarchy as some would have us believe.,NOT
is it too harsh to say she looks like a failed mtf trans trish not blaire.,NOT
it's really a dilemma i think it's about making sure the two trans girls are included socially etc with other girls while doing their sport but it's also about fair play my best suggestion of solving the dilemma is making an open female group in which cis girls and trans girls can participate a group only for cis girls maybe they could compete together but when the results and medals are announced the girls would be separated in a result for the cis girls group plus another result for the open group”?,NOT
thank i god,NOT
i'll be sure to avoid fake meat made from mold.,NOT
you are amazing i loooove you ️,NOT
good informative video message backed up with hard numbers so much better than the previous vox video on gender equality.,NOT
this video is accurate on every account...except when it comes to child-rearing the reason why men work longer hours even without prior notice is because they are the ones that more than half the time are responsible for less than half of all child and home related activities and responsibilities sexism does exist and even now women are still expected to take care of more than 0 of all domestic responsibilities this video implies sexism plays no part whatsoever and fails to factor in who takes care of the children in american households and how much.,NOT
vox video animation is great always enjoy this kind of video very educational simple yet infomative,NOT
if the difference is largely due to individual choice then i want to know why do women choose jobs that pay less or why does society think women should do these jobs also it is not entirely the choice of a person whether or not they get the job.,NOT
uh what about the wage gap between white and black people?,NOT
james charles version i'm attracted to straight guys.. so that makes me a straight female”,NOT
trisha i wouldn't say i'm confused well i'm very confused.,NOT
shut the fuck up you're a chicken nugget a lesbian now a gay man and transgender this is a total slap in the face to trans people can you stop trolling people please enough is enough educate yourself.,ABU
i had goosebumps watching it! yas let's go vegans!,NOT
also beans and rice are a big staple so definetely eat those for protein,NOT

she's always kept her channel and career alive by causing controversy and allowing people to bully and talk shit about her i'm one minute into the video and i can already tell it's nothing new \_(ツ)_/¯,ABU
"new shirt this is vodka by the way""",NOT
how about for the account of worked hours overwork i dont believe the wagegap is all that real the only diffrence is that woman tend to negociate less but if someone holds the exact same position in the same placew with the exact same hours you'll see the wagegap is none exsistend the only diffrence is though how you willl negociate,NOT
there's an earnings gap not a wage gap.,NOT
not suprided they are blackmen hell something must be in their food just too many black men turning gay the last decades.,ABU
this video just exposes how dumb trisha is... like emotionally and intellectually.. oh my god.,ABU

jesus christ at least try and sound like a girl oh hell no,NOT
i remember sometime last year one of my female classmates complained about the wage gap to which i said you along with 9 of university students in this building are art students if you want to tilt the scales get out and stop being a visual arts student. the only way women can tilt the scales if they leave the humanities and peruse more demanding careers most of them in that art building aren't even good artists anyways waste of money for them.,NOT
so if there's anything i got from this it's that men are lazy and leave the mothers to take care of the children so they make less money right am i right?,NOT
“i'm attracted to gay men i'm feel masculine because i'm assertive she's literally just your garden variety western masculinized woman they all say these things i've heard these comments hundreds of times in real life meanwhile everything about her demeanor screams femininity she's literally just overthinking herself.,NOT
finally some common sense in society people believe anything these days bloody feminists,NOT
wow so proud of you even if it's only for weeks rooting for you 3,NOT
fake for views this vid is weeks old,NOT
hahahhahaaha ugh this is gold thank you,NOT

people miss the fact that it doesn't exist,NOT
abc is gross for making it look like they are victims they are boys not wemon.they are ugly wemon people should do what they want but don't push your agenda on every one else.,ABU
i am not a feminist and i actually really liked this video i think the best part was you gave a somewhat practical solution to a practical problem i wish more left leaning progressives would do that because i might actually join them at that point the biggest problem with progressivism is that their best answer to problems usually revolves around cultural change or societal change society and culture are people's responses to the world around them it's not just a dial you can turn to your liking the only real way you can change a culture or society is by forcing people against their will to believe your ideology which historically is best done through a freedomless totalitarian government like stalin or hitler.,NOT
trisha paytas is a mess,ABU

although i'm a total left winger i enjoy listening to prageru because at least they say it in an intelligent way and it forces me to develop a smarter rebuttal if i can't then i tend to agree with it the problem with people now days is that people only listen to what they want to hear and become very polarized i recommend watching vox videos if you are willing to do the same as me i'm sure right wing media makes the left wing sound stupid and vise versa but you look at educated thoughts on both sides neither sound as stupid.,NOT

trisha fyi the only reason freelee is scary skinny is because she has an eating disorder after she eats large quantities of food in restaurants she goes home and throws it up bulimia. so please don't aspire to her diet for the reason of obtaining her body there are several signs on her body that give it away you can tell she is malnourished her muscles are shrinking in her arms and other places also if you eat a lot of carbs potato chips pasta etc you will gain weight but then again you're used to eating a lot of high-calorie food so just keep an eye on it with your scale at home good luck,NOT
did anyone in this comments section actually watch the video lmao,NOT
women are not available to work for long hours and with a flexible schedule because they are obligated to their family responsibilities and for which they don't get paid obviously) while men are obligated only for a financial responsibility towards the family even in cases where either of them earn almost the same women's inability to work in places where there is potential danger and where physical strength is required is highly related to their body makeup and what nature has given them it is foolish to demand biologically more from a the other half of the human population instead work must be alloted according to the universal societal obligations of both the sexes and most importantly their biological limit on an average common sense isn't enough to justify a problem of this magnitude.,NOT
i have been a vegan for the last years of my  year existence better late than never? i am non the less highly disappointed that you included greta thunberg in your video she is an exploited unstable individual who has no business leading any vegan causes on a world stage by your association with this indoctrinated child you damage your cause incredibly her public hysterics alienate  times the amount of people that would be swayed by her antics e.g her compadres spent more fossil fuel flying a private jet to follow her stupid canoe trip across the atlantic than if they had all flown commercial instead......stupid pr people! films like game changers are what will win over more people......not exploited mental nazi youth.,NOT

hahaha this bitch has an add before this video she's making money off of this shes just mentally ill go get help trisha,ABU
good informative video i think something that wasn't mentioned that could affect a women's wage is the likelihood of them taking time off or quiting their job all together i think men get paid more because they are much less likely to be out of work for children for maternity leave from a company's point of view it's just more reliable to pick a man to do the job and in a general sense they are a more financially sound choice.,NOT
transgender they became they are still boys in the body.,ABU

there is i'm highly conservative and i can confirm there is occasionally a significant wage gap a male coworker at my mother's work who she is friends with talked about salary to see if there was a difference since they have the exact same qualifications and do the same job the male coworker makes about 0k more a year that is not okay.,NOT
in my country women are paid way more than men in basic salary add other benefits like extra allowances less working hours better work life balance etc etc and. women are paid more than double of what men are paid with the same qualifications and skills ..,NOT

i own a business and have men and women working for me women have beautiful work ethic much better work ethic than men but when it comes to physical tasks in our place i find men usually can work harder for longer periods of time but not always true but i believe that's why men are paid more though there's a higher demand for male employees i have better success in my business hiring males over female but we do a lot of physical labor i hire women for jobs in my business that i need people to be more trustworthy and meticulous however.,NOT
literally the silliest thing i have ever seen on youtube.,NOT

it is not just about choice since the beginning women have been held at lower standards than men and it has been going on even now in 019,NOT
anybody else notice that woman's eyes were huge?,NOT
prageru is not a university it is a media organisation i'm not being hyperbolic it literally isn't a tertiary education institution and notice how the presenter didn't actually name any of the studies cited the first was referred to as a study by the american association of university women and the second was a nameless paper by the u.s department of labor a reluctance to name or link to studies in the description usually points towards cherry-picking information that suits your argument i don't know very much about gender pay disparity but i'm going to look for a more reliable source to help me figure it out.,NOT
so the only difference is. some women choose or get) in general jobs that pay a little less hm i knew feminists were stupid,NOT
if you go vegan you will be absolutely beautiful i think you are beautiful now but you'll be even more so i've been vegan months it feels great to eat healthy food but my soul feels even better knowing i don't need to kill anything for my plate i've only been watching you for a few months...just when you started to go out with sean and i've seen you come so far in such a short time go girl i see you are a beautiful soul 3,NOT

why have we not shifted our focus after all these decades considreing what has happened women have become less happy and we have too few children to sustain ourselves.. we need to widen the wage gap not close it we need more kids more mothers tending to their children family is more important than wasting away in a cubicle more important for women and more important for our society overall a fairly respectable video but as is standard with vox the presentation seemingly made for year olds was revolting as always,ABU
the ironic part is if we shift to a vegan diet we will kill ourselves of malnutrition.,NOT

"i listened to this with an open mind hoping to learn something new about the so-called pay gap that i may have in fact been missing i had been under the impression that the gap is a myth but was looking to hear other explanations as to why it persists all i learned from watching this video is that its creators seem to take issue with the fact that women have choices and that they choose different paths in life that men do not and in some cases cannot) this is why i can't support modern feminism as it is most often expressed in the mainstream it's a bunch of women shaming men for being men and shaming women for daring not to devote themselves to the corporate rat race and instead choosing to focus on their homes and families feminists have created deep confusion and unhappiness in several generations of men and women but especially women who i am finding feel increasingly pressured to achieve while at the same time being keenly aware that their youth and fertility are slipping away those that do have children feel guilty and ashamed for being away from their children in order to work while simultaneously feeling resentment that they are spending the bulk of their time caring for another human being and staying at home with each passing day i grow more and more disillusioned with feminism because i see the misery and internal conflict it is causing constantly i've come to the conclusion that feminists only care about themselves they care about being seen to fight for a cause"" they care about proselytizing and spreading their feminist faith to the masses but they do not care about women.",NOT

the on going debate continues on whether there is a pay gap between men and woman and there are many arguments on both sides with opposing views on this issue the way gap brings up the issue that women are payed less than men in the working field most statistics for this topic come from the census bureau which looks at full time workers according to gould schieder and geier they go into detail explaining the different ways in which other people analyze the wage gap from looking at specific occupations or by taking into consideration part time jobs and how this may lead people to think that data on the wage gap is unreliable however no matter how people approach how they measure the wage gap there is always a gap i feel that those that do not believe in the wage gap look at the specific occupations or varying forms of measuring the wage gap such as christina hoff sommars in the myth of the gender wage gap. in every example she explained there was still a gap between men and women whether big or small a gap is still evident her argument claiming that it is the pursuit of happiness that steers women and men to different career paths is not completely true there is a restriction women have due to their roles in motherhood and according to equal means equal even in female dominated professions men still get paid more looking beyond professional careers and taking into consideration professional sports teams men get paid much more than women when it comes to sports consider soccer although the women's soccer team far excels in the sport over the men's team they still get paid much less than them.,NOT
this is so stupid...i dont care if you dont want to be the gender you are born but dont compete in your pretend genders competitions its just not fair.,ABU
the argument of personal choices in my humble opinion is just trash she ignores that our personal choices are highly influenced by our experiences for example as a man i've been teached that i can do whatever i want if i try hard enough however i know tons of women who have been discouraged from the first time they've failed doing something if every time you fail doing something someones tells you not to try again or that you can't do that you are not going to even try making personal choices that involve being surrounded by men that probably are going to feel better than you and are going to make you feel like you're worse than them) you have to take in account the social reality in which you live when you're analizing this you can't take for granted that all men and women make their choices in the same situation because society is not the same for men and women.,NOT

let them compete in the men's competition oh my gosh i said men's how bigoted of me.,NOT
the wage gap is created by the manipulation of statistics earnings by gender thus men will always show earning more because bill gates the world's st trillionaire and sam walton jr owner of walmart are men proponents/propogandanists of the wage gap imply that women working the same jobs and same hours make less money which would be a violation of state and federal labor laws no company pays women less based on gender women get paid less for working less hours while men get paid more for working overtime vox intentionally omitted the fact that men work most of the overtime to compensate for their wives who opt to stay home to be with their children.,NOT
so even female pharmacists still make less than their male counter parts.,NOT
stop supporting her people she is disgusting i watched her video to see who she is she started eaiting enormous amounts of food chicken fingers and food i don't even know what it is freelee stop supporting her everyone can say i am going vegan stay vegan for a while then say i am going vegan what a stupid chick she is and so fat i can't look at her yuck who can eat that much??? shocking,ABU
i honestly believe that a job that requires extreme physical labor should amount to the same pay as a job that requires extreme mental labor both forms of jobs are used to service the world and if one were to not exist we wouldn't have a sustainable world i believe that gaps exist in both experience and that experience compared to mental vs physical i really don't think that a construction worker gets as much as a surgeon however both jobs are important one can save a life or give new life and the other can build homes for that life to live in.,NOT

hey i'm a vegetarian but most of the time in practically vegan i eat dairy maybe twice a week or so) and i looovee vegan food because you can get socreative with it it's really hard for many people to transition especially whn you're a meat fan and stuff you were asking about other foods besides fruit that you can have on a vegan diet and i can give you some ideas whicha re totally delicious and most people who eat meat love these as well and don't realize they are eating a vegan meal when they eat these pasta prepared vegan in a million ways bread whole wheat is so much better for you're health and physique sorbet this is a great replacement for ice cream vegan ice-cream yup! there is vegan ice cream made with vegan milks that taste just as good rice you can make veggie-fried rice vegetable curry my personal favorite quinoa which is an amazing and super delicious protein packed meal it can be prepared in different ways as well.. cold hot peanut butter make sure to get all natural or make your own at home by blending roasted peanuts w no salt don't add water almond rice soy milk frappucinos with soymilk putting caps so you know you can still drink those fraps girl just ask for soy milk or rice milk! nuts walnuts peanuts pistachios almonds! these are great protein packed snacks they also have healthy fats cereals check the package says vegan and low sugar is the best option vegan cheese almond cheese resembles mozzarella vegan yogurt made with almond or coconut milk acai bowls papaya bowls with no yogurt pitaya bowls hummus great for snacking with crackers carrots celery cucumber. etc mashed potatoes broccoli cauliflower etc with no cream!! oatmeal cna be prepared in so many delicious ways use almond coconut or rice milk or water ....so this is all that i could think of at the moment i really hope you can get back on track with veganism because it's not only great for you but also for the environment my recommendation is checking out some vegan restaurants near where you live do so through yelp or google it) so you can see how many different delicious options are placed on the menu and maybe you can get some ideas to cook yourself at home believe me veganism is great and fruit is not the only option you have for food and what i love the most about it is that you can get so creative with everything quick head's up marshmallows gelatine and gum are made with grenetine which comes from animal bone marrow not vegan of course. and quite disgusting) but there are vegan marshmallows which actually taste pretty good vanilla-ish and there's vegan chewing gum as well there are infinite vegan desserts that you can make too it's all about looking for recipes online unless you are the most creative person on earth at the kitchen) i hope this helps a lot! and i hope that you can last as a vegan now knowing that fruit isn't the only thing we eat haha:),NOT
here in my country we have gay and lesbian athletes that participate in men and women's division respectively and it's fine i remember watching a volleyball practice in school men's team and they have gay players on the team and they are just as athletic and as strong as their male teammates one gay player stands out to the rest of them the whole team he could jump so high and spike that ball so hard i thought it was gonna drill a hole in the ground he was fun to watch.,NOT

frozen grapes are soo goodd,NOT
it seems the two sides are talking past each other again even after explaining why the gender gap is there is clearly still a conversation to be had why is this the case that women are making these choices to be less prosperous then men and what role socialization has to do with it this problem however is a whole different problem from the original idea of women being paid less for the same work and has different implications still running back to the . wage gap buzzphrase is irresponsible and really the words coming out of peoples mouths should be more something along the lines of women are living less prosperously and ambitiously then men what could the implications of this be?”,NOT

this channel is what i was searching for for years,NOT

yayy so proud of you trish way to go i'm sure you'll feel so great and energized good for you love:),NOT
the only trans in her is the trans fat pumping through her vains.,NOT
used this to win an argument with my dad thanks,NOT
i don't understand the fascination with balancing the wages of men and women it is illegal to pay women less than men for the same job end of discussion what happens if the wages between men and women are balanced will society as a whole join together around a campfire and sing songs about how we are finally equal i doubt it unless there is a clear discrimination happening then this is just a pointless thing to argue about.,NOT
"a couple months ago my uncle forced me to watch  minutes of the magic pill"" i was so disgusted honestly and he just bought the whole thing...",NOT
brilliant absolutely brilliant thank you christina for everything you do.,NOT
wow leean god complex much?,NOT
why does that look like trish.. but at the same time not look like trish...,NOT
so it's caused by a legitimate disadvantage of having to take on the majority of child rearing that seems reasonable why is there so much vitriol and disbelief does anyone deny that having to care for a child takes effort that could otherwise be used towards a career and that that effort comes mostly from women i believe these statements to be true based on what i've observed and if they are true than it is obvious women have a disadvantage when it comes to having a business career leading to a wage gap it may not be true in your specific field but it is true in a general sense and we should work towards fixing it where we can.,NOT
im soooooo triggered!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,NOT
summary of the video trisha im a gay man,NOT
"trisha remember you also have to be active and exercise being vegan over time will drop your weight if you do it right but if not it'll do the opposite plus if you're really trying to loose weight eat the right portions just because you're eating a bag of carrots for ex per meal doesn't mean it's good for you portions,exorcise and do it right the first time i went vegan i didn't do it right and i broke out like a mf and gained alot of weight",NOT
blaire always coming through with reality period simple fucking reality! trisha kills me and i think she's just trolling she's sick and blaire is the queen of all of all ️😍 since you're reading comments you're gorgeous!!,NOT
i love you blaire you're such is a bad bitch!,ABU
if you need to make a video explaining a widely believed misconception then it must not be common sense.,NOT
if you watch her snaps she is eating non vegan,NOT
i love this video,NOT
one of my favorite meals are rice black beans and bananas ,NOT
for going vegan try to stick with whole foods as much as possible for the best results eat lots of vegetables like piles of vegetables and eat lots of fruit too a great way to get protein in lentils and beans also edamame pasta or black bean pasta is very high in protein there are also vegan protein powders and tofu and setian which is a made from wheat and lentlis and red beans this product is very high in protein there is tempeh too and also nutritional yeast also high in protein is chia seeds is around  grams or so protein for tablespoons even though it's high protein ist also high in fats it's a good fat but for plant based diet you want to keep your fat low don't consume too much of it i hope this was helpful and i hope your journey is successful  i've eben vegan for weeks now and i keep my protein high because i lift and want to keep my musle and i don't really low fat so far it works for me ),NOT
definitely an unfair advantage if this is going to continue then maybe they start a new class of competitors where it's fair to all participants males that identify as females and females that identify a males can compete against each other for those that ague it's not right i would say we don't have track competitions where females race males.,ABU
this is almost good enough to be a southpark episode ,NOT
men work higher earning jobs women choose to work jobs in fields like social sciences and arts get over yourself,NOT
how can anyone deny this?,NOT
so to summarize women make choices to get paid less while men make choices that pay them more so women should go make better choices what do you think would happen if you take the same top  professions and compare avg salary between men and women instead of generalizing that women make choices that pay less and could you not use sexist variables like men are more willing to work more than women that is sexist and a generalization.,NOT
this is sick they are guys i don't care what they feel those poor girls work their ass off only to be beaten by men now those freaks go onto further competition while the girls stay home.,ABU
remember last time you told someone they weren't trans then made an apology video?,NOT
i wonder why people care what gender makes more or less at the end of the day male and females husband and wife bring the money back to the household and spend it together i mean seriously why do you woman think that we men work so hard we work hard to provide for our family and give them a better future if we only thought of ourselves trust me we would work days a week and party days,NOT
if just taking some hormones makes it fair then where are the female to male track and field winners?,ABU

almost a year vegetarian almost a week vegan,NOT
when you dont got brain cells to rub together,ABU
the reason why they said there is a pay gap is because they combined the jobs so maybe more men have better jobs however that can lead to a controversial topic about employment discrimination,NOT
it's almost like people's incomes are based on the hours they work and the profit they create...,NOT
statistically if this goes on…there will be less qualified cis females who will be awarded state-level sports scholarships.,NOT

"i found this video very interesting i know that in class we discussed how the wage gap is 7 cents to every dollar"" according to the statistics in the article written by equal means equal however that didn't necessarily specify how these came about for example chrisitna hoff sommers breaks it down in her video there is no wage gap"" she says that this is just based off the median income of women and men i liked that they used median because this gives an accurate representation of the situation using an average would just mess this certain statistic up however she did bring up a statistic from an organization that is feminist that says the wage gap is only about 6. cents"" when all factors are included these factors include things such as what job they have and how many hours they work i liked how she pointed this out and set the record straight on this statistic however after reading the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real?"" by elise gould jessica schieder and kathleen geier the wage gap is looked into further the article has numerous statistics but figure k really stand out to me people always argue that there is a wage gap because of the education level between men and women however this chart showed that even at the same education level men make more than women on average this statistic is very useful because now men and women are in the same level and men still make more than women overall all these sources are helpful i think that there is no doubt a wage gap because there is just so much more evidence to prove there is a wage gap then to prove there isn't one i did find the video interesting because she does have solid claims to back up her point.",NOT
someone needs to fix her meds she's a hot mess.,ABU
yaaaayyy so excited for you trish!,NOT
anyone who supports bs like this need to kill themselves because supporting this shit is another weapon to furthermore fuck the world up...i gives no fucks about feelings when it comes to this shit so all that gay rights bs is complete garbage to me...if u dnt like it just pay somebody to accidentally hit u with a cement truck full of explosives and do the world a favor ,ABU

ok real life question but i guess i need some help to understand can't you not be transgender if your a female wanting to be a female but a gay man at the same time isn't that the most like . level of offense like you cannot be trans if you are already the gender you want to be it's one thing if she would like to be a man i feel like we would all be supportive but now i'm so confused like.. she wants to be transgender as a man but a woman can someone please help me understand honestly i do not want to offend or even judge her i just don't get it?...,NOT
yay i'm so happy thank you so much trish,NOT
remember if companies pay women less they would prefer women more it would mean money for the company,NOT
you are stupid,ABU
there's quite a bit to unpack here.. sure companies can hire only women and make their discrimination more blatantly obvious but i think taping a please sue me sign on their door would've been cheaper maybe the wage gap is lower fair doesn't mean it doesn't exist even with the same education credentials men still get paid more than women for the same job even aauw one of the sources she uses in the video said so also the point about men and women's common major choices is irrelavent because as confirmed yourself in the beginning of the video the issue is getting paid less for the same job her final point men are more likely to work more hours doesn't debunk women getting paid less for the same work for the same hours now does it thanks for pretending you're going to address the issue for what it is and then dancing around it.,NOT
w let me fry some eggs n steak for this,NOT

brock lesner should identify as a 45lb female and fight cris cyborg,NOT
transgenders competing with women is it an unfair advantage  yes of course it bloody is they can identify as what the f they want but biologically they are male with male biological advantages lets debate this another way men vs women in tennis women not able to compete physically with men men vs women in football women not able to compete physically with men men vs women in rugby women not able to compete physically with men men vs women in athletics women not able to compete physically with men but in this liberal pc mentally ill world a man who has a chromosome abnormality resulting in nature causing her to be born a him can compete with women despite being biologically a man and having the physical advantages such as strength/endurance and stamina it's like a athlete who uses performance enhancing drugs there's nothing fair about transgenders competing with women clown world,NOT
hey i've been watching your videos for a month and i love your content you're the first trans who have earned my respect seriously these days everyone around takes this gender thing like a subjective social matter and they just ignore inherent facts fron related sciences like biology and psychology now i'm a straight man who have had discussions about this with male and female friends i'm wondering what do you think about straight men who discard you for being trans i'd love to know your honest opinion on this matter hope yo see more of your videos i love you and your content d,NOT

i don't know why but i'm always surprised when i see a woman going against feminists and their made up crap,NOT
"one of the recommendations from this video is buzzfeed's one woman discovers the wage gap""",NOT
"no that isn't factually correct"" in the same field with the same work experience the same number of hours worked etc etc a woman earns the same well within a certain margin that is explainable by negotiation for pay men prioritise earnings more than anything else so they are tougher negotiating partners in most cases!) feminists would still be crying if it was  cents to the dollar  ps the gap is just all everything all men earn added up and everything women earn added up and then comparing the two it doesn't take into account that women often don't want to be engineers or in stem-fields in general then again woman are also under-represented among the physical laborers like trash-men not trash-workers but trash-men!) coalminers workers on oilrigs etc etc.",NOT

now we should ask ourselves why are women in less paid jobs and that is not only because of choise only a small fragment of ceos and other high managing positions are female while studies suggest that women in leading positions are often better suited for these than men for example it is very likely that the 00 bank chrash happened majorly only due to male hormones and that way to much risk taking while women prefer to play it safe so now why is there this difference in leading positions i can not imagine any other way but sexism.,NOT
women at my work get more hours than i do and make a dollar more,NOT

" glaring issues one mathmatical and the other conceptual begining with the marh you're using the word median and average interchangeably wich skews your conclusion as they are not the same thing to show this differences i'll use simple numbers if you have a data set a set of numbers representing value the numbers in this example are chosen to display the difference between between average and median that contains these  numbers 1,3,3,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,7,26 to find the average of these numbers you find the sum 1+3+3+4+4+5+5+5+5+5+5+6+6+7+23 and devide it by the amount of numbers 90\15=6 this average however does not account for the massive outlier a number far removed from the main grouping in the data set wich skews the data higher if you wanted the median of this data set you count inward from both sides to find the middle number with 5 the number with numbers on each side of it wich is in this case  though that difference seems small and are pretty close the numbers we used in this example are small and when you start comparing data sets and bring percentages into it the difference becomes bigger imagine we have a different data set let's call it set b and call our original set a and set b has an average of and a median of  if we compare the averages we get a  different because /6=1 they are the same number however if you compare median you get a 7 different as /5=.8 and -.83=.17 that difference is small with are numbers but when you have larger data sets like data on wages that percentage makes a difference and that difference between average and median can skew your conclusion wich is why all the citations of information in this video are incorrect because you're using studies that compare medians and studies that compare averages together and interchangeably and therefore reaching a not entirely incorrect but nevertheless fallacious conclusion now issue  a bit shorter you cite that / too paying jobs are primarily male and / lowest are mostly female and when accounting for this you get a very small wage gap however the comparison of the total averages yields a larger gapthis inherently means that more women work in lower paying jobs wich speaks to a larger sexism issue not with individual employers or even individual industries as you've shown the gaps with industry accounted for is small but can can meaning might indicate a larger issue that because if societal expectations women mostly go into certain fields fields that pay less than mostly male dominated fields congrats to making to the end hope this does something.",NOT

the earnings gap is one of the most hilarious public policy discussions of today because  i don't think the government should force women to go into fields solely because they pay more  i don't think the government should force women to work more hours than men to offset the difference in hours worked  i don't think the government should force women to make specific decisions in which job to take which salary to accept  i don't think the government should force women to be unable to take time off from work for childcare childbirth  i don't think the government should force women to demand higher pay over healthcare or other benefits.,NOT

veganism/plant-based eating is the only thing that makes sense for health and specity humanity all living species) but to use the climate-fanaticism in this is a big mistake as there is not human-caused co2-based climate problem worth talking about we could talk about pollution all the shit that does not include co2 and which seems to have been forgotten completely in the co2-frenzy that is a huge problem!! co is a greenhouse gas in the sense that it makes everything grow faster ask anybody with a professional greenhouse operation and hence greening the planet but since it is heavier than air and always will fall down ever heard about gravity? and cannot hold heat it does not cause any traditional greenhouse effect.. when the grand solar minimum is cooling the planet dangerously and the whole global warming thing is debunked finally it may take the whole vegan movement with it which would be a disaster for the reasons mentioned above.....,NOT

you got man hands dude...,NOT
i am a trans male i know how gender dysphoria works and everything and it is different for everyone and listening to this video i would not say any of this makes you a trans male usually someone will not go 000 as female and male when trans if you're gender fluid or anything else like that yes maybe but trans ftm no. so maybe you're gender fluid i don't wanna somehow invalidate you in any way but watching this video me and my other trans ftm friends feel invalidated and hurt by this and this will just be a way people can make fun of and invalidate the community here.,NOT

if the gender wage gap had any reasonable meaning companies would increasingly and almost only hire women to lower their wage costs nobody does that therefore closing the gender wage gap is a target entirely based on ideology in particular the premise that men and women are equal in the sense that they should achieve the same income on average this is equal in saying that a construction worker should earn on avg the same income as a stock analyst because they are both humans and therefore equally capable of earning the same the gender wage gap was and still is ideological bullshit.,NOT

the fact that this kind of total absurdity could even spark any debate and mainstream news agency reports there are compelling arguments from both sides show that western countries r getting totally dumbfucked after legalizing gay marriage,ABU
these are some valid points the only thing i would add is as follows *note i don't think that the pay gap exists but i'm open to different opinions if they have evidence of their thoughts  women since they give birth to the child they will most of the time be more caring towards a child  women also can get paid maternity leave in which they still get paid their same amount but taking care of a child  if a man and a woman are working in sales with commissions it depends on how they are selling if the man sells more he gets more money if the man sells less he gets less money and vice versa with women.,NOT
for everyone saying eat pasta bread and rice omg nooo do not eat rice bread or pasta it has so many carbs and add pn pounds very quickly ... secondly trish is you want soda then drink diet soda it has no calories or sugar and doctors and nutritious doctors suggest people on diets to drink diet soda if they are craving soda!,NOT

statistics on wage gaps are almost usually manpliated to make it look like its a real thing but the reality is that when you put all the factors in and not just add the occupancies and wage per hour you can make a clear deduction that the gender wage gap is in fact horse manure and on par with the flat earthers who believe the earth is flat.,NOT

my biggest tip is if you mess up don't give up!! it's really hard especially at the beginning so if you have a piece of pizza one day don't give up all together you will find it will become so much easier as time goes on and then you will mess up less and less and not even crave any non-vegan food anymore good luck you can do it!,NOT
there's also the fact that women on average go to the doctor more often takes more sick days and works less overtime this is not to say anything bad about women they are usually and i dare to say of course on this more likely to be the ones that take care of children and do chores around the house besides if you earn more than 00k dollars a year before tax then there's nothing to complain about.,NOT

i can't believe someone would create such a biased video without addressing any of the real factors women may choose to work other jobs because they don't have a choice they don't want to endure the stress of putting up with harassment in jobs that are more suitable for men their husbands expect them to take care of their children therefore not giving them any other choice but to stay at home and imagine being a woman and part of another minority group you will be facing a lot of social barriers videos like these will not change the social structure that has been created over generations so please review your work before making such a biased and misleading video.,NOT

only problem i've seen is that women not mothers don't get raises as often men but aside form that if women want equal pay for equal work stop having kids to a business kids are a burden that take you away from your job and making them money a working mom is not as valuable as a childless male or female or even a working father who takes little time off get over it you chose to have kids and the problems that come with them you can't expect to be paid the same as a person who rarely takes off and works on holidays and over time while you take off to spend time with your kids or take care of them if they are sick it's just common sense.,NOT

if you are a woman how is the wage gap affecting you if the issue is that women do more unpaid work like taking care of their children because they want to then how does that affect you as an individual if a wife and husband decide that the husband is going to do the unpaid housework and childcare from now on the woman will be earning more than him tl;dr the woman prefers to do the housework the gap wont affect her if she solves the housework problem with her partner.,NOT

"sorry but you forgot a main reason women work less hours and earn less because of it they're expected to be the parent who stays with the children while the men are expected to work fully because they're the breadwinner"" there are both men and women who want this to change there are men who want to be more present at home but can't find a job who provide them that and because of that the women have to stay with the children or else.. when men and women will be expected to be a parent and a worker equally then it will be changed.",NOT

went vegan cold turkey in 017 was off and on until the beginning of 019 when i decided to do it the right way and gradually cut down vegetarian for almost all of 019 and then just went back to being vegan about a month ago i regret not doing it sooner i'm so much happier!,NOT
all feminists triggered,NOT
try researching the term demi-girl i think that's what she's trying to explain.,NOT
i talk to my friends and they dont care about anything except eating more meat......and there in lies the problem.... and i believe most people simply do not want to stop eating meat regardless of the health issues and they certainly dont give a crap about the planet....probably easier to reign in our rogue federal government than to stop meat eating....and you know we cant stop the out of control crooked fed gov....,NOT
i'm really happy how freelee is handling this she's being very kind mature supportive and very helpful so proud of both of them.❤️❤️,NOT

everyone is complaining about how she only eats a plant based diet and how she isn't vegan guys give her time and let her figure everything out it's a big step in the right direction!,NOT
hmm it is kind of wierd and even absurd that they calculate average salary that way it is more correct to campare sums they pay to males and females for the same vacancy.,NOT
there is a wage gap in between everyone.. the reason there is a gap is because everyone has different performances different shifts and different attendances.... you can't be making the exact same amount of money as your coworker.. if equal pay was actually a thing people that have bad performances are going to be paid as much as a person that has good performance would get... and i'm not necessarily saying that women have worse performance than men one more thing... i know a couple that worked in the same workplace different shifts but were the same hours and in the same department the lady makes about 00 more than her spouse and i guess it's because he doesn't get things done sooooo... yeah...,NOT
i disagree with the points made in this video...i don't have any argument against it but i disagree and therefore i'm right,NOT

you know if its a wage gap then why are the hours people work the defining factor is that not rather an earnings gap?,NOT
women are more likely than men to accept a lower salary i'm guessing i'd like to see a study done on the differences if any in willingness and ability to negotiate for a higher salary as well as employers willingness to accept or decline requests for a raise based on gender.,NOT
even if those girls weren't transgender they would still dust that ladies daughter  people just gotta take the big l and tell they kids to grind harder 👏🏾🤷🏾‍♀️,NOT
what i love about blaire is that i can scroll randomly through her videos with my eyes closed and click on anything and be entertained theres not many youtubers i can do that with,NOT
"if this is true from trish  this didn't happen due to freelee's usual bullying video this only happened after a nice collab effort like normal human beings no freelee's approach still doesn't work  she said vegan for weeks"" there is no such thing isn't that basically plant based""????",NOT
this is the one and only thing prager u has ever gotten right in terms of being factual i will give them credit for this thing they have not been either lying through their teeth about or misrepresenting facts to support good on you for actually having a legitimate argument for once ever but i immediately retract my praises when i realize the only reason they don't lie about this subject is because it fits their narrative and position without need for modification therefore there is no need to go through intense mental gymnastics to make the position fit their views like almost every other single goddamned subject they bring up but here is a newsflash people on the left already know this fact the only ones who still believe in it are new wave feminists and overly extreme leftists you are late to the party trying to debunk a situation that has already been apparent for quite some time now to anyone who isn't insane or stupid.,NOT
"more people should be listening to christina hoff sommers on this topic not milo yiannoupoulis she says brilliant things without feeling the need to bring every ounce of attention to herself ruining the legitimacy of her arguments with the inflammatory nature of her ego which is what milo does guess what dude when you say things like if women had been the predominant gender in the world throughout history instead of men we'd all still be living in grass huts."" you aren't really going to get very far in an argument about equality.",NOT

you're missing carbs!,NOT

the planet is going to end whether we become vegan or not foolish thinking lol if you believe in god you'll believe that it will end because he says it will if not then you'll foolishly think mere human efforts will be able to eternally sustain and save a planet that was doomed from the beginning you can't save something you didn't create foolish we can't even save ourselves from dying foolish we're subject to death and dying just like the earth eventually will be nothing lasts forever on this planet so why would the planet last forever foolish 🏽‍♀️ that's not saying not to watch what you eat but the world is destined to wax worse and worse what shall mere food consumption within humans do against the hand of the lord shall his will not come to pass because of mans plan to save the planet” this is so similar to the tower of babel event within the bible with mere human effort they desired to build a tower that reached heaven and tried and failed to launch attacks on god read the book of jasher chapter  don't you know that that arrogant plan failed we really think we can save the world but we in america alone don't even acknowledge god as god instead turn to god for world destruction under the lords hand is soon to arrive and those who endure abide in him and hide under his wing shall be saved.,NOT

my male teacher said that the wage gap is real to all my fellow classmates and they believed him so retarded that a teacher can't even figure this out.,NOT
exactly by saying that men earn .0 to .7 is basically saying that men work harder so they earn more females chose different paths and as a result get lesser pay.,NOT
in my feminist country tge wage gap is revese....man paid less for the same job...and this one is true the survey was very well constructed idk how it is in dollars but a women get when guys get .95 this is unfair and there is no man movement here....cause we dont care we want the best for our females unlike the feminists that wants the worst for man...we dont have any kind of feminism and everybody like happily here,ABU

earnings gap!!!! compare wages for the same position in the same job and that silly gap disappears. different pay for different positions is nomal.. in cases that there is a pay gap for the same work in the same position that is sexism i'll need some citations if you find any company that does this and should be changed as it is illigal to pay a women less for the same work,NOT

i do love that household chores are listed but yard work isn't how about auto maintenance building projects diy chores i'm a stay at home dad and my wife still does way more household chores than i do but it's not because she's oppressed but because she is willing to clean the whole house if i do the bathroom cleaning the bathroom sucks and it gross but it takes me like an hour a week so i just do it it's the same deal with mowing the lawn i've never brought up doing it to her other than to make the point about what i do around the house because i like doing it i take a great deal of pride in my yard but when it comes to cleaning out the dog kennel bernese mountain dog bernese cross two boston terriers and i run a doggy daycare) that sucks but it still needs to be done again it buys me a lot of chore credit so i accept it and just do it the problem with assessing people's personal choices at home is the lack of context my wife would love to stay home clean the house and take care of children but she got a really good job that turned into a great career and it's not cost effective if women aren't on your equality bandwagon that's fine it's time you stop worrying about such stupid things.,NOT

"omg trishaaaa i'm so happy you're finally going vegan i'm sure you'll feel so so so much better it's actually harder to think about going vegan than actually doing it i though it would be a problem but it's actually so easy and simple and i feel so much better mentally and physically wish you so much luck beautiful! so happy for you my recommendation for you is to get informed and to carb the f**k up,don't be afraid ",NOT

"""if? they have an unfair advantage???? seriously????",NOT
if a woman chooses to be a mother it should be her primary role when the earnings gap is viewed in contrast to the lack of men's parental rights it makes sense women earn less because they can force their ex husbands to pay for everything if they want the burden of child rearing shared they should also share parental and reproductive rights.,NOT

women do it to their self i can tell just by going to college for several of years in the software programming and tech classes women are nearly non existent while software development is one of the highest paying jobs out there most classes will average like - women out of a 0 people filled class room and that's even considering that more women are actually in the tech field compared to  years ago the most women i've had in one of my classes was  but even that was a database class that can branch from a general business degree go even into health care and majority of women you'll hear are going to be a nurse i don't know if it's insecurities or what but i don't think people can blame wage gap when it seems most are purposely going for lower paying jobs instead of trying to become a doctor.,NOT
i find it funny that they use a female to talk,NOT

trishhhhh noooo why didn't you educate yourself on what it actually means to be transgender before you recorded this i sense you're trying to vocalize feelings n maybe lean toward gender fluid which is great and you should explore this and be open and pride about it hell yes but you're totally misunderstanding and misconstruing being trans and def saying some things that are pretty wildly offensive even if you didn't intend it to be yeeeeeesh educate yourself first bc you gotta at the very least understand the terms before you claim to identify i support you exploring your gender identity and sexuality but please please please invest some time in educating yourself first! you're gonna ostracize yourself and others in the community with hastily labeling yourself without understanding xx,NOT
there is a massive difference between choice and society norms this doesn't address underlying meanings of wage gaps.,NOT

i agree that feminazis blow this stuff out or proportion and that the gender wage gap isnt what they say it is however this video is weak imo i want to love it i really do but the arguing here is a little weak  around :2 you say the small wage gap that does exist... while having the title there is no gender wage gap pick one  slide at :5 has the word may which completely destroys its value you can say anything may cause anything provided its not 00 false the slide is literally useless because of this word.,NOT

there is a pay gap but gender is only one of many components amongst geographic location social class colour ethnicity age etc etc.,NOT
as a female i do notice a wage gap but for all i know it's a result of the male wanting to negotiate more on salary and the company's health could also have played a role because he was hired later after about a year or two of working for the company another female was hired who made a little less than me and hadn't even finished her degree.,NOT

another seemingly obvious point that gets overlooked all the time is how relationships are formed between men and women call it whatever you will but women usually end up dating and marrying men who earn at least as much as they do often more when you are talking about people in higher earning positions let's say 0k+ and it comes time to start a family it is often easier for the woman to take time off work or leave the work force all together when their spouse is making enough money this also has a negative affect on women taking on more work or chasing promotions which comes with more work there is no real incentive to do so when the husband is earning good money the combined income of both people earns themselves a very comfortable life style there simply isn't a need for the woman to earn more next up actually compare two people in the same exact position within an industry chase as many examples of two or more people in identical positions as possible and study the earnings gap.,NOT
wow it took you years to acknowledge that the pay gap is a myth and that perpetuating lies may hurt your image your arrogance knows no bounds by the way you're not fooling anyone anyone with even half a brain knows you'll lie about anything for as long as you can get away with it.,NOT

i started being vegan in feb 01 almost my first year i will never regret it.,NOT
wait it compares the median wage not the mean that's moronic the median is just the middle number value out of a large sample size it is not useful in comparing statistically the wages of men and women as it either underselling or overselling the differences because of it the median doesn't take any factors into account of the study sample and is just lazy to use.,NOT

welcome to the era of i feel happy about it hence i'll do whatever i feel makes me happy. this highly sensitive and easily triggered youth are just off track it's absolutely scary how we are taking feelings over facts.,NOT
and this is why the wage gap is more sexist towards men than women men are seen as the expendable workers who are expected to work or even give their own life to provide for women they are forced by society to take higher paying and more dangerous jobs while women either stay at home and live comfortably off of their husband's money or work in a comfortable low paying job men are seen as expendable workers who must respect and provide for women and women are seen as holy princesses who have to live their lives comfortably this is also why men aren't allowed to hit women because women are the men's superiors and must be treated with respect and care. it's also why women have their feelings coddled and cared for when men are expected to never show their emotions women deserve to have their feelings cared for because they're not expendable and no one gives a shit about mens emotions because they are expendable.,NOT

actually fuck yourself you're female in every single way you are not trans you do not have gender dysphoria i am so insulted by this as a real transgender man you have zero masculinity which is needed to be female to male ask a doctor educated on the human brain or gender identities and they will say you are born with a male or female brain you were born with a female brain and everyone sees that you are far too old to be doing this shit with the amount of people who know you it is so wrong to be posting this it is wrong to allow anyone to think being transgender is even  a choice jesus please delete your channel,ABU
you shouldn't be worried about over eating you really need to make sure you get all the vitamins and nutrients that you'd normally get in dairy and meats such as proteins and vitamin b12 i recommend getting some nut/oat/soya milk with no added sugar and also non dairy butter to make the diet easier also make lots of lentil/pulse soups which are really yummy and filling good luck!,NOT
this is vodka btw,NOT
what influences those choices made why do women not choose to go into those top earning professions if you say it's because they aren't capable.. that makes you sexist if you say it's because women are reinforced that they are less capable than men from as young as years old which means they grow up to make those choices.. then you agree with science.,NOT

are you really gonna believe a dumb woman like that.,ABU
"lmao to the people asking why not just hire women"".. have you been watching the video at all if women make less money on average because of kids or other availability issues which is what this suggests) then you would need to hire more women than you would have men and women combined just to get all the necessary work done this video suggests that women who can commit as much time as men will make just about as much really if you can split up the parenting load perfectly equally with your spouse and you two have worked the same job for the same amount of time this evidence suggests the wage gap between you two will close.",NOT
the wage gap is a myth,NOT
i was waiting for this!,NOT
men need to step up and do more housework and child care so the work is split equally between men and women if that happened the wage gap would be much improved.,NOT

blaire i enjoyed your thoughts about trisha being a troll lol.,NOT
the language u use to describe relationships with trans people is really problematic i believe u when you say you are trans but please learn some more things and try to not just talk about this stuff in an improvised fashion a lot of your gender theory is based around traditional gender roles which is exactly what being trans is not about look into genderfluid and genderqueer identities please talk to more trans people.,NOT
but they'll never listen to these facts this gender wage gap has been debunked so many times that it has become a joke whenever they use it.,NOT

so your last argument after taking in variables it will vanish to almost nothing is that without any study or verification you are just implying that it will vanish that is blatant hypocrisy you know first you manipulate data and say women just take lower paying job by enforcing sexist values throughout families and then you just assume what the hell is that you yourself said that it shrinks down to . to peecent why not a zero percent? you just assume that small wage gap is not important let's do a fun maths game if every american male earns 00 dollar for hour and a woman is paid percent less taking your generous average then she is just paid 4 dollars now that  dollars might not seems much but then it gives a decent fast food meal to fill your stomach once and that is important to many lower classes now if you multiply the hours worked by both the genders by  hours approx a five day to work week it compounds to 10 dollars and then if you multiply it to week month that is 7 hours..then the wage compounds to 10 dollars now that is a lot okay that is enough to make you survive comfortably in a middle class home for at least a week now it seems you are bad at maths not just the corporations and yeah i might have forgotten to take some data points into account,NOT
piers morgan is an over dramatic coward.,ABU
they should form their own transgender track meets they aren't being fair and they know it sick.,ABU
"cotton candy grapes are my favourite i also love nice creams"".",NOT
don't be afraid to eat too much!! your'e body will function so much better and process the food so much better if you are fueling yourself: and as for food suggestions i literally live off of rice and beans smoothies/smoothie bowls and nice cream banana ice cream is sososo good and its all fruit so you can eat a lot of it and feel great and look great at the same time and you can never go wrong with oatmeal,NOT
i reallyyyyyy want to go vegan but my parents won't let me cuz they think i am still growing and i may stunt my growth due to not consuming enough protein also my parents eat a lot of meat and they say that they don't want to make special meals for me helppppp,NOT
trisha talks nonsense to the camera the way people talk to their best friend behind closed doors i respect that.,NOT
the game changers was an amazing documentary,NOT
i think trisha is just confused in general she's addicted to pills she's done coke and meth and she drinks drinking isn't that bad but she said she binge drinks which isn't normal or healthy behavior the concoction of shit she's on is probably messing with her chemical balances in her head and she is trying to rationalize how she feels but trying to identify a certain way it isn't right and i'm not defending her it's just way deeper than being trans i don't think she even understands what it means i'm not trans but i understand what trans people go through and how they don't feel like they're in the right body trisha doesn't seem to have a problem with that she's just confused her video was bizarre and i wonder if she was high on pills in a lot of her crazy rambling videos she's high so i don't see this as making any kind of sense lol,NOT
i'm happy for you ,NOT

i've operated consulted for and owned various businesses like most entrepreneurs administrators consultants and executive my focus was hiring persons who were smarter than i was less for me to do and maximizing profits if i could have hired women and paid them less than men for the same job i would never have hired men the fact that men have these overpaid jobs and are even hired is contrary to any bottom-line consideration and that is the big lie in all this.,NOT

bitch why you in the kitchen??????,ABU
lol do people not transition because they feel hyper feminine or hyper masculine masculinity and femininity have everything to do with gender i genuinely can't tell if you're just trolling in this vid or you really are this dumb to pick on other trans people and try and come for gigi by saying that she's not the brightest crayon in the box? no disrespect to gigi tho. bitch wtf you wear the same black outfit in every fucking video...,NOT
so basically wage gap is a myth created by incompetent researchers and propagated by feminazis ?,NOT

crap now i'm hungry...,NOT
you forgot to mention that men are expected to work longer hours so over a day we earn more and we're more likely to die at work yay!),NOT
yes!!!so proud of you trish!,NOT
you know i would hazard a guess that the reason women take lower paying jobs and work shorter less consistent hours is because of the social pressure and gender roles that dictate that they should females are encouraged to take lower paying professions because those professions are often more traditionally feminine typically female dominated areas will probably seem safer for women to take and typically male dominated areas will seem safer for men to take women may work fewer hours because they are expected to care for any children children they are expected to have.,NOT
potato and pasta are your best friend for life gurl!,NOT
theres a word and a term for not being male or female only its genderfluid oh my god t wtf.,NOT

hello! need help i think is awesome the movement its growing so f**ing much i've been vegan for months now and i did so much research before taking the decision i've been thinking about it for like a year now i feel good but everyone tells me i look pale or like really weak not out of anger or anything just concern i don't do rt4 but i really do eat alot always until i'm full and i really do think i eat a good vegan diet no trash so i really don't understand please someone help cause i do not wanna go back! i do not restrict anything i don't come from an eating disorder i've always eaten as much as i've wanted to so i'm just lost here h e l p!,NOT
i like how this video doesn't just blame sexist employers and looks at the actual causes of the wage gap.,NOT
freelee is that thin because she does so so much sports it´s rather about sports not about being vegan.,NOT
now i'm fine with transgender people but i don't want or would like them to call them female they are male by the rules of biology and this shows what the problem with them they will abuse the system as shown.,ABU
i think the wage comes in the form of pay for different works women's work fields we know women typically occupy are paid less than fields where men make up the bulk.,NOT
she also said she was a meth addict not long ago for those who say that when a person tells you what they really are you have to believe them and no hunty if jonathan yaniv came and told me he's trans i wouldn't believe and never will that only keeps paving the way for creeps and pedophiles trisha should be aware of this issue and not troll with certain things shit is tough as it is today and there's no need to add layers to it.,NOT

i've never seen this video before i'm shocked to hear someone other than a youtuber or controversial figure actually talking about this i applaud this video.,NOT
i agree with most of the things said in here and btw you are beautiful but when people come out as whatever they want to come out as wether it's trans bisexual gay etc. they don't necessarily have to talk about it 4/7 some people are more shy and like to keep their sexuality as something personal especially big actors like jaden smith and some youtubers so sometimes they just want to let their fanbase know more about them and just because they announced it does not mean that they have to mention their sexuality in every conversation ya feel but hey that's just my opinion i definitely think that trish is either a troll or that she genuinely needs help.,NOT
i identify as a robot or at least a cyborg.,NOT

trish i love you i really do but you and i and all your viewers know this will never stick yea you might last or days but once that intense hunger sets in and your craving dairy or meat...sigh...you go thru these phases and they never last i do wish you the best tho but we all know this will never last and once you make a video of you eating meat or whatever your gonna get all this hate you do this stuff to yourself i think if you wanna do something positive just keep it to yourself so when you fail you wont receive hate from the internet just trying to help big hugs ...,NOT
i am so proud of you  it sounds weird but i could never become vegan...,NOT
"""i don't like to be the center of attention literally has a profile pic of her in a glittery bra with her chest out",NOT
the wage gap has been debunked many many times,NOT
the video alludes to women working in different fields lower paid fields earning less money and then goes on to completely ignore this for the rest of the video part of the sexism of the wage gap is that female-dominated professions are paid at lower rates than male-dominated professions this isn't because they take on less risk or are less valuable to society it is because the value of these roles is not acknowledged because traditionally the value of women is not acknowledged the nursing profession the teaching profession the childcare profession these are all highly valuable to society and high risk yet the are paid lower amounts.,NOT
where is the sauce tho,NOT
ok one thing straight you are not trans....if you are trans or feel trans you don't have glam nails you don't wear female clothes look her profile pics-... but she agrees that she is the 000 the gender she was assigned at birth.. it doesn't have logic,NOT
smdh yep the world is about to end take cover lol,NOT
even when you do take into account all the variables like occupation hours worked etc there's still an unexplained wage gap of %-8 depending on who's doing the math.,NOT
i need some fried chicken...,NOT
we all have feminine and masculine energy it's normal.,NOT
she's a troll i don't think it's about fitting in with anyone or being special or unique she's just trolling last month she fucked an alien blow up doll on camera so not much phases me when it comes to her i'm surprised people are actually covering the topic though.,NOT
she's a troll she's doing it for views and to stay relevant which is what all these response videos are giving her y'all think you're so smart but in reality you're just giving her what she wanted lol.,NOT
i like this video but i do wonder about when she talks about the choices women make when it comes to job choices because in the highest paying jobs listed women are less likely to take them because of the discrimination and expectations they face so when i look at it they present an illusion of choice that it is 00 women's choice to not take those jobs for the most part this is a well presented video but i'm just thinking about that so maybe it's not only a wage gap problem but also the gender disparity in fields of work.,NOT
well people shouldn't assume that a woman is confined by hours and household responsibilities or future child bearing responsibilities it is not for all women.,NOT
vegan mac and cheese vegan spicy chicken patties add the chicken to it or even put it on salads or make tacos eat brown rice potatoes and salads and pasta too.,NOT

so this is how she feels not biologically she a girl who was actually beautiful at one time was dissed by her ex because he ended up liking dicks too this made her crazy so much that she questions her own identity she now sees herself as a boy who likes dicks so is she gay no she's a biological girl that likes dicks no matter what she decides to wear.,ABU
i bet u that everyone who disliked this video is a feminist,NOT
the left wants to use biology to argue male privilege when it comes to abuse and rape but not here.....what gives just because you say or feel you are something does not mean you are.,NOT
i really hope you can do it this time please remember it's a lifestyle even if just for weeks it includes no leather no animal products at all regardless of if its edible or not when you are vegan you need carbs you need to eat plentifully eating small amounts puts your body into fat storing mode never be hungry but eat the right things embrace the carbs avoid the fat and sodium if possible vegan isn't a diet it's a lifestyle and you won't loose weight in weeks if done properly first your body goes through detox from all the animal products then you may put on some weight as your body ajusts to eating well in time you will loose weight you loose weight slowly but it stays off unlike a fat diet in weeks though your skin will glow and you will feel so good you won't care too much about weight anymore well done i'm proud of you soak up advice and welcome to a healthier happier you ️❤️,NOT

as a trans person i find this disrespectful tbh,NOT
trish there is nothing manly about you your mannerisms your style the way you speak and think all feminine this is all so staged she says i don't like to be the center of attention really trisha really,NOT
how is it ok to kill an animal but not a human!,NOT
yes i'm a feminist and i realise that the wage gap is highly exaggerated in the us and other first-world countries but that doesn't mean that feminism is bad perhaps the extremists but not at the core of it) or that gender inequality has been fixed developing countries have a huge gender inequality in literacy schooling/education work and relationships there has been so much progress made by the movement which is why we should keep the name feminism to respect and acknowledge the history and achievements made by some incredible people and groups) but there's still so much progress to be made please don't harass people who use the word feminism or people who don't get all their facts right harassment does not educate people or allow for conversation can we instead be open-minded kind and ready for compassionate discussion?,NOT
shes trying to be deep but shes as deep as a puddle,NOT
i for one am completely in favor let's see so called feminists stand up for women for once.,NOT
i think the trans community is actually calling to her to say lay off the fillers you look like you have a peanut allergy and need an epi pen lol,ABU
yea both of these guys have an unfair advantage even if they undergo hormone therapy so transgenders can race other transgenders but not real women don't blame the people who have an actual point.,NOT
+vox now what i always ask my self watching these videos how is it that house and child care is considered a burden but income generation an opportunity there is no evidence that this in any way reflects actual attitudes towards both occupations in fact it is rather the opposite) so why is it always preented this way?,NOT
you can still get stuff at starbucks they offer dairy alternatives also you need protein since you won't be getting it from meat and cheese beans legumes nuts if you make up some rice and beans and then toss it in a frying pan with some onion carrots a little garlic and soy sauce is my favourite way to eat beans you also need green vegetables there are all kinds of goodness in green vegetables that we all need kale and spinach are my favourites and an easy quick thing to do is have smoothies for breakfast or lunch i will take some water or some good juice and blend some spinach banana and frozen fruits and it's great on the go for a quick pick me up meal accompanied by a snack lately i have been pairing it with watermelon.,NOT
as a business owner if i could hire women to do the same job as men and get away with paying them less i would have only women working for me so would every other business this statement alone should be enough to end this debate once and for all.,NOT
wage gap is  cents on the dollar within the margin of error,NOT
finally not a feminazi,NOT
more like a plant based diet and i'm not hating on her but i don't think she will last that long people enjoy eating meat mostly because other people do and it makes them feel more comfortable and normal for doing it so some one like her who enjoys processed foods will more than likely crack when she goes to a restaurant with her meat eating friends.,NOT
200 butthurt feminists who deny facts disliked this video,NOT

eat lots of rice and potatoes,NOT
i feel with all of the backlash it's going to make people anxious about coming out and figuring out who they are. i don't agree with everything trish said i think she has alot of soul searching to do but i also do not agree with all of the hate she is getting and i do not believe that it is our place to tell someone who they are or aren't.,NOT
just came here to say there are only genders,ABU
what the actual f*ck like what the...this is so offensive it's fucking offensive you say you're not trying to be offensive but you are i am trying to understand you but you need to see a professional counselor being trans isn't a choice if it was a choice i would choose to be cis i would choose to be normal i hate being an outlier i hate feeling like i don't fit anywhere i hate sometimes thinking how much better it would be if i just wasn't here anymore because i hate being the way i am do i have pride yes but shit like this is a huge slap in the face how dare you trish t whatever name you prefer us to call you how dare you.,ABU
i do not eat any animal products for the last years. i have an issue identifying myself as vegan the industry though is better than the meat producing industry..there is a lot of processed vegan foods out there...in the bigger picture survival of human species and a healthy life is what we aim for..but the vegan trend and people who follow it are being exploited by those processed food industries,NOT
it's not like women are statistically more educated,NOT
i'm a vegan fan of yours freelee turned me on to the lifestyle get some vegan cookbooks protein beans rinse well) lentils dark leafy greens you don't need as much protein as you think to survive we as a country eat way too much protein good luck trisha i'm proud of you!m for trying ️,NOT

i would recommend the vegan corners channel they have great fast recipes that are super helpful just remember if you feel hungry go ahead and eat more as calories from plants aren't as dense as those from animals products you can have big meals and not feel guilty i'm so happy you've decided to follow a plant based diet and i hope you feel the difference immediately d,NOT

why are all of you so angry at feminists who protest like for one century or even less whereas men were generally dominating for the rest of human history there are exaggerations but some feminists might overreact to be heard by those sceptics and not because they want to exterminate men anti-feminists are as well over-happy to see this video as possible evidence that feminists are wrong.,NOT

not to be like the one to say no trisha youre wrong but for people that identify with being transgender identifying with the sex you was born as isnt a thing that happens like you kinda need to feel dysphoria.. and feeling like both isnt really what trans people typically say maybe youre describing a different feeling i would look into other queer gender identities.,NOT
hahaha her going vegan lasted a hot second fake bitch can't stick with anything.,ABU
so can anybody recommend any vegan baking videos or recipes or even books i've been a veggie for years now since i was 3 but more recently i have been cutting out dairy products too and changed all my beauty products and all that stuff to natural cruelty free items i think that means i'm slowly converting) i miss baking and could do with some yummy recipes to try cakes biscuits etc also i much prefer videos like these i find the swearing and stuff hard to watch i understand it's coming from a place of passion but it's nicer to hear much more positivity and encouraging words ),NOT
i never wear makeup or dress up...am i man now?!,NOT
ugh trenders you need dysphoria to be trans,NOT

"it just depends on how you define wage gap"" if you define it as women earn less than men then there is a wage gap if you define it as women earn less than men on the same career path then there's still one it's just much smaller if you include the discrimination of females from choosing certain career paths then there's still a large gap anyway so there is a wage gap the debate is how big it is.",NOT

also that's not true you cannot eat as much as you want even on a vegan diet there are vegan cakes cookies cupcakes ice cream and you can't just eat all of them just because they're vegan you will still gain a ton of weight.. so the whole you can eat as much as you want on a vegan diet is absolute bullshit,NOT
yes love you!! beans soy meats nut milks vegan cheese rice. all these will help you transition to vegan food!! they are tasty and don't just start with only fruit because that is not sustainable for most people it's soooo much easier than people think to be vegan you have made a connection with the animals and you are a loving person and you want to be healthy so please stick with it you are making such a difference talking about this with your subbies!! bless you!!,NOT

that's so great one day at a time girl 3 if you like how it feels and you know you want to eventually be a vegan for life know that it can happen and that if you go back and eat some animal product once twice a few times you don't have to throw in the towel some people go vegan overnight and stick to it but many many people don't like me if you really feel how it feels in your heart as well as physically and mentally you can get there never ever thought i'd go vegan either in the past.,NOT

"does vox realise that its main points disproved the theory of the wage gap completely i tried to sit here for half an hour to collect counter arguments to all your points considering that people in the comments are arguing that people didn't watch the video i managed to cut it down to a few points  your statistics in a few areas only correlated to certain fields of work e.g business) this creates a misleading argument in the statement you made you also did not reveal the ratio of men women in the graduate pool so its very difficult to accurately say that men had higher salaries out the gate"" do you mean on average or in the whole what jobs did they take with what companies this doesn't account for peoples choices out of school argument looked at thousands of men and women who graduated from 99 006 men earned more out the gate""  it's a fact that many years ago women were actively payed less than men for the same jobs its completely ridiculous that you are using arguments from 97 all the way back to 948 i mean really? 948? the difference begins shrinking because of pay equality you absolute morons as they approach their 0's and 0's was moving into a time where sexism in the workplace was actively being tackled pay was becoming equal so of course the gap closed it really has nothing to do with pregnancy at this point argument :25 if you look at women born 973... same thing for women 968.. 948....  if you do want to argue pregnancy in a relationship it is two peoples choices to have a child having a child has consequences good and bad you have a child you work less to take care of that child perhaps women do take on a disproportionate share of responsibilities but it is up too the people in the relationship to decide who does what we have maternity leave for a reason for both male and females argument :10  these statistics dont take into account the actual jobs themselves its illegal to pay women less these statistics and the way you are phrasing them are misleading stop saying the word pay women aren't payed less they earn less yearly because of their choices in the job argument :45  if you dont show up for work or can't work the same hours as a man you are not going to be payed as much i dont care if your pregnant i dont care if you are lazy you dont show up you dont get payed you are contradicting yourself because it sounds like you are saying women have children which force them to have time off but we should make jobs more flexible for them if you choose a job with less flexible hours thats a choice you made society doesn't have too pander to fit your every need argument some jobs require really specific hours not available to her clients when they need her"" :30 i could go on but this is boring now your still citing statistics from the 970s to fit whatever agenda you are pushing in 017 so congratz if you wanted too prove that the wage gap only happens now because women work less hours you did it women aren't paid less than men so too call it a wage gap is totally misleading women get the same salary as man women earn less than men yearly on the whole because of their choices jobs hours etc this entire video was confusing and misleading it sounded like you were saying women are payed less then you were saying they weren't but all i took out of it was that in order to shrink the wage gap we need to make jobs more flexable for women"" the simple answer is no.",NOT

men shop themselves around more often especially early in their career women are far more likely to stay i their first job for longer while men are more likely to check the help wanted sections or hire a headhunter to try to find a higher paying job men are also more likely to ask for bigger raises at the end of the year the company isn't going to just give you a big raise every year if you don't ask. when you compare men and women with similar everything...similar education similar years experience and a similar philosophy on work either both men and women who shop themselves around and change jobs frequently or both men and women who are content with their first job then the wage gap disappears entirely in fact then women get a few cents more.,NOT

personally i think we need governments to push for all to eat less and less meat dairy eggs rather than push that people go 00 vegan straight away yes we all need to go 00 vegan but so many folk out there are so feckin stupid and obstinate they will only change if they can keep some meat then with time we need to push for all of them to go the whole way it might not be how we wish people would change but i think it's more realistic health wise though this vegan meat substitutes may be better for the earth which is great but they certainly aren't better for us and our own survival.,NOT

this is actually well done considering vox did it ultimately you've shown that more women need to pick better jobs and better education seriously why is is always in business business or nursing and it's because of flexibility however here's the thing vox you've also shown that there is nothing wrong with an earnings gap if women want to take care of the kids fine it's their choice some men are stay at home dads and that number has increased for a few years now if couples decide to have traditional households with women as the caretaker and home maker or if they want to swap roles that's totally their choice whatever the couple decides is their choice and there isn't any reason to persuade women to do anything other than pursue whatever they want to pursue.,NOT

so essentially men get paid more because they are more able to compete successfully for the difficult requirements of labor in different fields if we are to look to basic economics as a guide it would be more economical for men to specialize in these areas where they possess an advantage and for women to specialize in the areas where they possess an advantage considering the fact that what determines the specialization of the sexes are biological realities it is fairly irrational and uneconomical for women to desire to enter into the workforce in any economy that values efficiency of production.,ABU
man trisha you were doing so well '(,NOT
thug kitchen cookbook is the best vegan cookbook ever it has tons of super easy vegan recipes for every meal of the day snacks drinks desserts everything in the book it also tells you all of the basics of cooking and how to cook and it is written with a bunch of swear words and stuff making it super funny i obviously highly recommend it especially the broccoli chickpea burritos which are so good omg!,NOT

yaaaay trish i am so proud of you!!!! okay so remember that you can eat as much as you want(don't over stuff yourself though but try to keep it whole plant based food becuase the processed stuff is generally not the healthiest thing for you just because it's vegan does not make it healthy try adding more satiating carby foods like potatoes rice etc fundamentally looking at our basic animal cell these cells get their energy from carbs so don't be scared!! if you need motivation or more reminders as to why this life is an amazing choice i recommend watching cowspiracy not gory or anything like that but very informative and inspiring good luck babe i promise you will love it xoxo ps google how to veganize starbucks if you catch cravings),NOT

maybe all transsexual woman should stop using transgender to define themself becaus our true specificity is transsexual few years ago i had big fight about those transsexual who wanted to exclude the ones who choose to keep there genitals and named them as transgender but this is not reality being transsexuals is about hormones and not surgery someone who remove the penis does not make this person a transsexual a man whitout a penis still is a man but named eunuch so to remove a sex genitals does not make a transsexual this is the fact and the truth it is only by the hormones that we become a woman and change our body from inside it is the hormones that grow breast and modify our shape so all of those who are on a therapy of hormones to change there gender become transsexuals there is no shame to use this word it doesn't make you a sexworking person using this definition if this is why you choose not to use the real definition transgender is a generic noun to put everything in it even the alien anybody who play with there look by fantasy or anybody who is delusionals about things related to the human state transsexual is a specific noun and only people on hormones can be name like that it exclude all the others and by the way things are going it is better transgender noun is harmfull for us by the way non-binary and else has use this to put discord in the society by doing so they destroy all the sensibility build by the pioneer from the last  years or more this is what we can observe i am a transsexual woman when some people come to me and ask if i am a transgender i correct that for transsexual becaus this is what i am really and i do not want to be associated to all the crazy people clamed to be transgender them and me are not in the same side we must stop that non-sens.,NOT

you can most definitely gain weight on a vegan diet same rule of thumb calories in equals burn calories out don't overeat your average daily intake,NOT
do it for life it's easy i did it a year ago.,NOT
so basically women aren't paid less rather they work less hours and therefore earn less than someone who can work more hours seems fair enough why does this need changing?,NOT

"one of the things i hate most about.. all of this... is that it's trendy to as you say come out it's trendy to be progressive it's trendy to be part of an oppressed, or marginalized community.",NOT
i'm mean your choice i don't get why there is hate i mean sure you mabey didn't have to make a video but thats fine if you identifies as a gay guy you did put a disclaimer at the start so even if it sounded effective you didn't mean to be right the viewers really shouldn't be hating on you its your choice love you anyway!!,NOT

i'm so excited that you're joining the vegan movement i've been vegan for about months now and let me just say i feel a lot healthier and happier considering i went through some depression in the last year i have always loved animals and i think that this cause is amazing some tips that i find very useful are to surround your self with food vegan only so if you are ever tempted to go back to the yummy non vegan snacks the only food source you have is vegan food i also recommend looking up lots of youtube channels that do vegan recipes and websites that promote vegan friendly dishes best of luck to you and becoming vegan hopefully you will stay on this diet after the weeks!,NOT
she is the stupidest most offensive and ignorant ugly ass bitch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,ABU
hum sooo how it comes that every woman i know are less payed than men for the same job that means same task hours education etc...),NOT
the comments restore my faith in humanity,NOT
it's amazing it took so much time and effort but it finally payed congrats freelee ),NOT
i don't care what she said in that video but if you or anyone else say that trisha isn't trans that is horrible we don't know what is in her mind you of all people what if i told you no you are not trans nope you need mental help,NOT

waiting for freelee to make a video now,NOT
companies want profit the more the better let us say that a company could hire a woman who do the same job for less money why wouldn't the company not just hire women and fire all men i don't get it.,NOT

what we have is,NOT
yes omg beans and rice and lentils are so versatile in cooking!!! so many dips and falafels are surprisingly vegan going vegan also encourages a lot of home cooking like curries and other rice dishes dips and cool potatoes so try to make time for that too just remember that a lot of junk food may be vegan but that doesnt mean its healthy also for chocolate most dark chocolate should use soy instead of cow milk also drink loads of water just for the general toning of your body and keep dancing good luck trisha congratulations 💜💜💜,NOT
piers morgan is a.. bawbag is that how you say it?,NOT
man i feel like a woman🙂,NOT
i love watching your videos they are so hilarious and help us understand why the us is failing so much xd,NOT
wow im attracted to straight men wow i am now a straight woman,NOT
when i even heard about it i was like why are we giving her the time and attention for this? shes a troll and it's kinda messed up for her to do that but she just wants attention and nothing more,NOT
another reason is because its illegal to pay women less or more,NOT
its also maybe the fact the pharmasutrics are a heavy female led perfession,NOT
yay i'm so happy i love you and your videos and this makes me happy so much as far as tips its so easy to get vegan food that has spices to make it taste exactly like any meat you might be craving troll whole foods and the natural section of stop shop because you'd be surprised how much food is actually vegan also you can make anything into a vegan recipe experiment with tons of different foods and remember it might take a few tries to find cheese you like and other foods don't eat just raw fruit and veggies because you'll feel tired and run down and make sure you're eating a lot fruits and veggies don't have tons of calories freelee was right about eating tons of food with no guilt) give veganism time it grows on you you'll feel amazing after a while you'll have more energy and your body will thank you! love you! xo ),NOT
given the information presented here sounds to me like the only true way to close the gap in the workplace is to close the gap at home.,NOT
there is a form of drag that women do theres a word for it but i cant remember i love drag i.just do.,NOT
that dude with the white bandana runs like he's a goddamn running back for the chicago bears wtf?,ABU
you were one of the people who encouraged me to go vegan and i feel so good inside and out,NOT

wow vox is finally starting to admit that the wage gap claim is a myth amazing never thought i would see this day.,NOT
so happy for you trish you can do it!! ),NOT
i think women that are married and have children should be prepared to loose out on some money maybe stop being so selfish for a moment and think about the bigger picture you're a family the child needs a mother especially in the early years to take care and nurture said child if you don't want kids and want to pursue your career go ahead then you will earn as much as your male colleagues,ABU
the real problem here is to put the man to attend kids and focus more on family not to create flexible working hours so that the woman take all the family responsibilities,NOT
my diet staples are fruit vegetables potatoes oatmeal pasta rice...avoid oil at all costs even though its not an animal product if you want to shed fat dont eat high amounts of fat also checkout high carb hannah mommy tang the vegan sandwich show...also the edgy veg is a cool recipe show.,NOT

omg we are winning!!!! humans are coming to the rescue in saving the animals planet earth i am so so proud of us guys thank you for waking up!!!!!! woo-hoo!!! even my sister is vegan now ),NOT
my number one tip is to stay educated watch forks over knives earthlings cowspiracy best speech you will ever hear by gary yourofsky secondly carb up potatoes rice pasta beans legumes fruits thirdly find alternatives that you like there are so many brands that make vegan meat i recommend gardein also there is a vegan alternative for absolutely everything just find what you like and what works for you it may be tricky in the beginning but it is honestly sooo easy ),NOT
earning is the word you are looking for,NOT
in other words women have more privilege flexibility and choice and can achieve a life/work balance men simply have less workplace rights and have to work more than women women don't need to work as much as men because quite often men support their partners lifestyle choices if you want the wage gap to disappear let's stop putting the responsibility on men to pay for everything and let's give them equal workplace rights paternity leave and retirement age.,NOT
so cutie yaaaaaasss😍😍,NOT
u don't like older men liking you????? r u kidding meeeeee,NOT

hell yeah girlfriend good for you i hope it works out well beans potatoes and avocados are lovely and filling.,NOT
so i identify myself as what these people in the comments seem to hate and villainize a feminist it is true that the myth has been debunked but you still have to acknowledge that women recieve much more obstacles to the path of a successful career then there are safety issues attached with the working late hours also childbirth is a major reason for women to compromise on their careers regardless the wage gap is a myth and it's a little known idea we need to spread the word.,NOT
you work at the same job but do you work as a manager with a good education background and for  hours a day no then don't complain you make 7 cents less! now go make me a sandwich.,NOT
not a claim its biological science they are genetically males not girls no matter how they feel they will always be faster no matter what.,NOT

can you send me some feminists tears that you got with your video?,NOT
i hope freelee sees this!!,NOT
trish was a high b drunk c.all of above when she said she would go vegan for weeks.,NOT
what a bullshit reporting the issue here is not they being a transgender the issue is they competing against natural women and taking advantage of their body structure.,NOT
women tend to take more time off work and take more breaks off work and ask for raises less and they tend to work in fields with less paying jobs,NOT
you already admitted that when you control for all the factors you listed there is still a wage gap you just proved that the wage gap exists and that it's not explainable in economic terms you also left out institutional barriers to working in higher paid positions the argument that businesses would higher more women if the wage gap existed ignore that if women are viewed as being less valuable then they will be paid less.,NOT
i feel like this is literally representative of the entire non-binary movement i sincerely hope that this is a joke and she's doing it satirically to point out the fact that fashion is not the same as gender lol but whether she meant to or not that's what she did for any person capable of logical coherent thought love you blaire!!!!! 💖💖,NOT
try beans and or lentils for protein,NOT
anyone else stunned more that people where making 300k years out of business school?,NOT
i would really like a way to find your sources please,NOT
if companies could pay women less for the same work they'd never hire a man why pay a man a dollar to do the same everything that a woman will do for seventy-seven cents?),NOT
is there a wage rape tho 🤔🤔,ABU
you know being a gay man doesn't mean your feminine or anything cause that's what u think it means but it doesn't being gay means u like the same sex not that your a feminine flamboyant guy that can be the case but not always i should do some research u seemed confused,NOT

" being vego will make you gain i gained over 0kg when vego then went vegan and lost like 0kg.. struggle to keep it on tbh. stay away from the dairy! its pure fat baby cow growth formula fruit veg carbs like potatoes pasta rice and like maybe a couple of awesome vegan donuts per week or day and you will lose weight. your body may need more than weeks to adjust though so please don't be discouraged if its not immediate its a lifestyle not a diet keep that in mind if you're only doing it to look good its called plant based"". took me a couple month to fully adjust so please be patient and don't expect results a in a couple weeks or b if you are still having chicken eggs or any milk products ooorrr c if you're not in it for the right reasons bc it won't last and therefore it won't work) oh also if you eat unripe bananas you'll be constipated also the food you showed is like literally one meal! more potatoes!  good luck trish. please listen to the advice and don't expect results if you don't do it right yeah?!",NOT

i don't think trisha is on drugs i do think she is having some mental health issues going on and possibly on the verge of a break down she seems very manic/bipolar i hope she gets the mental help she needs.,ABU

what this fails to show is the fact the the other male half of the home is probably working  hours a day days a week to provide for the family the woman is doing a disproportionate amount of home work... well the man is doing a disproportionate amount of dangerous labor and working an aggressive overtime schedule stop blaming society for a problem that doesn't exist.,NOT

mcdonald's is going to regret being so late to the changing diet 01 was a big year of change for me i'm not vegan but i do eat 00 plants when i'm not around friends or family i've been trying to do plant-based for about months with varying degrees of success i had a few bad weeks and even a couple months where i just ate garbage so my progress has been very slow however i still feel so much better than before i started i've lost  pounds so far i'm seriously at my high school weight i'm still overweight but goodness i never thought it was possible this year i'm going to be stricter with my friends and family i've been making such excellent progress and i don't want to lose it because of them i know they love me and all but they try to sabotage me at every opportunity despite knowing i'm trying to get healthy i wasn't at all interested in fast food fake meats until recently i finally realized that fake meats have one advantage over real meat lack of hormones no one eats fast food for health but if my friends are going to take me to these places anyway then i can at least get the healthiest option i haven't been to kfc for years but i actually want to go just so i can try their vegan sandwich i obviously won't do that all the time since it's still very fattening but i'd like to try it once.,NOT

for protein i make quinoa and brown rice on a weekly basis gardein has really yummy fake chicken not super healthy but a nice treat if you have a craving the beauty of a vegan diet to me is that i eat until i'm satisfied but don't experience the pain and exhaustion of overeating food my body struggles to digest dairy is a hard one to give up especially cheese to me the cheese replacements are a bit pungent i personally like sautéed mushrooms as an alternative the most important thing is to remember that we are all doing the best we can and wherever this journey leads you we have to have respect for one another's choices.,NOT

when the one girl mentioned that she was looking at social media comments about her the reporter said some of those comments were harsh like saying terry and andrea had an unfair advantage because they were boys. that's not a harsh comment at all that's just someone stating the facts there's a reason they have separate sporting events for men and women there's a reason they have the women's record and the men's record in track and field one of the trans girls mothers commented during her interview it allows her to be who she wants to be and that has more weight than winning a medal not to the girls competing against her who are trying to get college scholarships it's great that she has loving supportive parents but i hope people realize this is a complicated issue...and being against them competing in state finals has nothing to do with being anti transgender.,NOT

have you explored nonbinary or bigender as a better label for your gender gender is very individual and there might not be an exact label for your identity but those might better encompass what you have said in this video,NOT

bro in order to debunk anyone saying a wage gap is real just ask them if people could hire women and pay less then men why do people hire men,NOT
this isn't a video about gender wage gap it's about equal pay equal pay is just a small part of the gender wage gap why do women choose jobs and hours which pay less maybe it's because they want kids or maybe they weren't pushed towards it as kids themselves i feel like she needs to clarify the difference,NOT

but this is trash and very stupid insensitive and unfair why do females who turn to male not partake in male sport ???i guess we know the answer to that because they cant keep up the way our bodies are formed are very different and that wont change even if they refuse to acknowledge the body in which they were born into their own sport should be made they still retain their muscles and a whole lot of other stuffs that is the composition of a male body its a big disadvantage to people been born female ,NOT

men make up 4 of workplace deaths and suicides. but we aren't arguing to close that gargantuan gap are we in addition the wage gap is irrelevant* as despite earning less women control more money than men men earn 1.5 of all income but only account for 5 of domestic spending men only spend 0 of what they earn after tax in contrast women make up 8.5 of all income but control 5 of domestic spending meaning women on average spend 0 more money than they earn* rd wave feminism is a joke..,NOT

im confused why people comment refuting the gap when the video confronts most of the arguments people use to disprove its existence that study of those graduates from business schools makes it seem pretty concrete that for one reason wemon typically working less hours due to social pressures that make them more likely to handle the bulk of child rearing or another out right discrimination it exists.,NOT
im surprised vox would actually tell the truth,NOT

the greatest thing about this is that a woman is speaking and has sources from a feminist organization the key piece missing here is that the smaller percentage of women being hired in stem fields science technology engineering and math are actually paid more than men due to corporate demographic quotas so though women may be under represented in those fields by choice it is actually discriminatory towards men in the aspect of payroll savethemales,NOT

here's the answer to your bullshit wage gap women have jobs that are not as hard to complete as what men will do they do the easy jobs then expect to get paid like a man working construction when have you ever seen a woman working on the job site laying bricks or shoveling dirt at a construction job never that's just an example it goes for more then just construction like my example was,NOT
there's an earnings gap not a pay gap there is a earning gap because women on average do less hours and work less dangerous jobs.,NOT

also jobs that are considered female have a lower salary naturally nurses teachers child care professionals maids all have salaries that are significantly lower than say construction manufacturing and so on these jobs have a lower salary because historically they were female positions and since the female was nvr a main bread winner they could naturally pay them less.,NOT
i have a feeling that the larger gender pay gap in business than in other industries has to do with risk tolerance i don''t believe their hypothesis that it has to do with flexibility of work hours in business markets tend to close at usual hours whereas in tech you gotta be constantly on call in case something goes wrong.,NOT

this got me thinking about intersexed people... have they been allowed to compete i mean if someone is born both sexes then they might have an unfair advantage or not depending where they get placed to compete men's or women's sports i believe what used to be done in this situation was to just throw them into women's sports i do remember some news stories about this and i have to say it is rather unfair it's not only unfair to the women but to the intersexed as well it would seem a solution would be start another division for intersexed but with so few births being so who would fund it on top of that it wouldn't be fair for transgendered to be thrown in with the intersexed division because of who's taking what hormone could have an unfair advantage so would a fourth subset for transgender athletes be needed again who is going to fund it it gets kind of crazy the transgender thing is one issue but what about those who are intersexed this idea of sports competition seems more legit because intersexed people aren't choosing to be another sex like how it is said about transgendered should sports be off limits to the intersexed and if so wouldn't that be unfair so technically this is the same problem different issue.,NOT

the stat that said that women still did the majority of child care despite both parents being in full time jobs my initial thoughts were  how many hours overtime is the man doing  what are the couples professions is one say a receptionist and one is an industrial engineer it was not stated but elsewhere in the vid it shows that woman as a group earn less per year than a man so you can infer that the full time woman is still probably working less hours in a lower paid job than her husband that said both parents should take a more equal role in child rearing than still seems the case today.,NOT

"""vox now declared anti-feminist due to its correct and factual ideology of the wage gap""",NOT
i worked in a predominantly male industry for over  years and made more money than most of the men and women in our group the reason why is because i was single and had no family commitments i was willing to work the long hours and do standby everyone else had family commitments they needed to pickup kids at daycare or go to a school event the women were always taking time off because their kids were sick and thus not dependable i found the women were always complaining about how they didn't get paid enough but were never able to admit that it was because they were unable to put in the extra work to get the raises they always wanted to blame it on sexism.,NOT

this video pisses me off to the core not once have you mentioned real gender dysphoria in my eyes you need dysphoria to be trans i hang out with mostly boys too that doesn't make me trans you seriously are making the trans community who go through hell everyday look bad shut the fuck up fr,NOT

trisha you do not need to go vegan just stop eating so much heavy processed food and eat a wide variety of fresh organic food eat clean drink a lot of purified or spring water stay active rest treat your body well focus on health you can eat a high plant based diet and small amounts of organic pasture-raised meat eggs and wild fish but if you insist on doing a vegan diet you need to make sure you get enough protein eat a wide variety of food get your bloodwork done and consider taking a high quality multivitamin there are great vegan foods and also lots of junk food stick to mostly unprocessed food organic tofu and tempeh brown rice quinoa steel cut oats leafy greens fruits beans sea vegetables like nori) sweet potatoes avocado etc etc etc eat well-rounded meals and check out vegan youtubers who eat balanced diets not diets that exclude a lot of different foods like raw vegans there are also good vegan protein powders like sunwarrior and vegan meal replacement shakes like amazing meal which you can mix with vegan milks like almond milk and a little bit of natural sweetener like stevia coconut nectar pure maple syrup or brown rice syrup it would probably be best to find a dietitian or a nutritionist who has experience with veganism who can show you to do it the right way.,NOT
i would never expect it,NOT

"great vegan protein/fiber sources main things you need to focus your diet around to lose weight or just stay healthy😃 oats very cheap also and filling) every and any kind of nut many breakfast cereals are vegan but i recommend kashi go lean kind for the most protein beans especially black beans are great brown rice tofu it absorbs any kind of sauce very well and is amazing grilled peanut butter or peanut butter powder which is lower in fat calories and tastes great then anything soy like soy milk and also there are many veggie burgers that are vegan but some contain milk or egg so make sure to check the ingredients first so happy for you trish!!! hope you continue this diet! also just wanted to say oreos are vegan in case you want something sweet and ben and jerry's and other brands make vegan ice cream you can purchase also taco bell has some vegan options like i usually get the layer burrito with no sour cream or cheese it's already vegetarian) oh and i forgot to mention most whole wheat breads are vegan,just remember to check the ingredients.",NOT

this is why we should go back to being the gender we are born with,NOT
i want to believe anyone who says they are transgender or that they have been raped just because they say so most of my life i have done that in these recent years when people have publicly declared that we have to believe everyone who says they are transgender or have been raped i think it is difficult to do so once you publicly declare you will believe someone you are just publicly recruiting pathological liars they can't even help it it's our fault for publicly declaring unconditional and absolute belief.,NOT
so if i understand correctly because you don't wear a lot of makeup in real life and you're not overly feminine you're a guy 3:00-3:47 you are not a male because you do not identify with femininity/female gender roles female societal expectations and saying otherwise is crazy harmful gender / sex honestly the more i think about it the more i'm realising radical feminists have the right idea when it comes to understanding sex/gender if you identify with a gender that's different to your own so in this case masculinity instead of femininity you should work to dismantle gender norms to make it so a female can do traditionally masculine things like....not wearing makeup without it being weird your sex and identity aren't the problem and you shouldn't work on changing either so it matches whatever gender roles you want to follow again the implications of doing this are crazy i don't understand why a right winger saying females makeup is sexist but somehow wrapping the same talking point in leftist mumbo jumbo is all of a sudden progressive.or take use another example you gave i feel male because im assertive' progressive i'm not even mad at you trish we live in a society that's so binary that its very normal to feel the way you feel but i hope you realise soon that you are not a male just because you don't 0 percent behave the way you are expected to as a female you're just normal no-one identifies with their gender/gender roles 0 percent edit:i've just finished the vid and i think the issue here is that the female form is very sexualised by the male gaze and i think in many ways presenting as a male short hair binding wearing baggy clohes is a way for you to evade that very sexualised perception of your self by men the freedom you feel by presenting as a man makes sense as you've said males are free from the expectation to wear makeup we don't have to do our hair we don't get looked at it or hit on by weird sleazy dudes sending you lots of love it probably isn't at all to feel what you're feeling and i hope all the people attacking you take a step back and realise how normal it is for you to feel the way you feel as a woman in society like ours.the male gaze is toxic af.,NOT
i wear over sized hoodies i don't wear makeup i wear boy hats i fancy girls and boys but bitch i'm happy female  u aint fucking trans lmfaooooooooooo im wheezing,ABU

they have unfair advantage simple,NOT
i might be crazy but anyone else understand trish here and doesn't think she is trolling everything she said can be proved she has always been attached to gay guys she always had lgbtq friends she does either dress up like a drag queen or just roll out of bed i think she just shouldn't label what she is and just go for what she likes.,NOT
feminism and sjw's will be the death of this world if not corruption of government which has already begun for a few years now,NOT

this is not fair males are naturally the dominant party in this arrangement i'm not watching sports anymore with this type of bullying,NOT
please dont do the rawtill diet because people tend to eat a lot of calorie dense foods so unless you burn off all those calories then you will actually gain weight and also the diet reduce fat which is very unhealthy if you want to be alive,NOT
i totally see you're point and trisha is the biggest trolls so i don't really believe anything that comes out of her mouth however although my opinion may be irrelevant considering i'm cis i believe you don't necessarily have to transition to identify as something other than your assigned gender.,NOT
so she's attracted to cedric and feels the need to make a video to justify that?,NOT
guys i have an idea what if.. the wage gap is actually caused by a combination of the phenomenon described in this video the fact that women might be less ambitious on average and a bit of old school sexism?,NOT
"i went vegan 00 and it was very easy...feeling much much better,my skin cleared(-dairy)and my energy level raised.besides i lost  pounds of fat.i took vitamin b1 and multivitamin supplements from the start on.after years i developed a iron deficencie(ate chia seedy and green plenty of green veggies a day),so i adapted my diet. years ago i developed bad mood and depression because of b1 and omega (eat my walnuts every day deficencie i ate a mostly whole food diet with little to none processed foods...the problem is:every body is different and the gda recommodations are not perfect for everyone.some nutrients you just get from eating the same foods every single day.and that can be very hard i switched to a planned based diet with a little animal products here and there i take pills everyday and have my blood checked once a year i will never eat meat or fish again its the only choice for the clima!! but to say its easy,is plain irresponsible!!!",NOT
sooooooooo b a s i c a l l y trish is having a james charles type of shishtar scandal and is attracted to gay men so she's covering it up by saying she herself is a transgender gay man so it's okay for her to like gay men plot twist her husband is a gay man and so she's making this vid right before the wedding as her explanation for why it's okay,NOT
there is no gender pay gap because gender is a lie.,NOT

it happened here in the philippines  decades ago search for nancy navalta and it is 00 unfair even if they identified their gender as a female physically their body is still male if they hadn't undergone mtf surgery because after surgery that is when the body literally sync with their mental state.. happypride 🌈🌈,NOT

really proud of you!!,NOT
half the people commenting make no indication that they even watched the video.,NOT
good luck trish i'm really proud of you haha d ok so i have been a vegetarian not vegan but i did try it once for a couple weeks for i think almost and a half years now and i have never felt better i hardly ever get stomach aches and feel bloated only when i eat a lot of candy or whatever it was honestly such a fantastic idea and there are meat alternatives sold in so many stores like trader joe's and such made from plant protein that i eat it is so good for cravings you might have at the very beginning of this life style there's vegan chicken and beef believe it or not some have eggs and dairy but others are completely vegan and you can find vegan foods in organic type grocery stores like sunflower market and stuff like that protein can be found in tofu i recommend tofu for sure in different sauces and stuff with rice even just seasoning lemon and in nuts nuts are very important lol like almonds get some tubs and stuff of like trail mix/nut mix.,NOT
the title frustrates me because it may not have been the best received but you cannot and do not have the right to say that she isn't.,NOT
there is no such thing as a wage gap men simply work more statistically work harder jobs 1 of deaths and injuries on a workplace is men this id because women simply don't want to have these jobs and generally work less than men so there is no wage gap men just work harder and that is a statistical fact and i don't care what you say yes there are women who work hard but not as much as men so this whole wage gap thing is just bs that women want us to believe to give them even more of what they want stop using your gender as an excuse and if you use taking care of a child as an argument you are even more ridiculous don't have kids then if you want to pursue a career.,NOT
steamed white rice with nori sheets and sliced avocado for vegan sushi... love you girlam so proud of you flawless inside and out!! love an italian/hispanic girl from mar vista by santa monica........,NOT
this is going to sound absolutely awful but based on all your videos and everything i feel like you were probably sexually abused when you were young you're just very screwed up mentally you're not a gay man trish you're gender fluid not transgender literally look up the definition of gender fluid you dont have to use the pronoun they or them if you're gender fluid.,NOT

cry babies disliking the video aproaching,NOT
i think you are just gender fluid..........,NOT
straight away i knew there was gonna be terrible comments 😂,NOT
fellow liberal brethren and sistren stay out of the comments i beg of ye conservatives have flooded our safe space with triggering opposing viewpoints don't read their idiotic and problematic posts or they might just change your mind not because they're right but because of their patriarchal control and use of sexist facts'!,NOT

maddox sure does look different these days,NOT

okay she really just said i identify as a drag queen man as someone who has been out as non binary for years now this disgusts me and really offends me i want to say that first of all dysphoria of some sort is needed to be trans it doesn't have to be with your body like for me i found it harder to deal with my name and pronouns and people using the wrong ones etc as well as disliking my body but not as much anyway this video is bullshit and i can already see her saying the trans community is unaccepting in the future but actually they're some of the nicest people i've met and supported me through a rough time in my life.,ABU
im so happy and proud trish❤️❤️,NOT
people realize that the wage gap isn't representative of two people with the same exact job the problem with the wage gap is that women are stuck into traditionally lower paying jobs based on systematic oppression and irrational gender stereotypes it's not communism it's a culture still recovering from political social and economic gender inequality.,NOT
thank you for calling this out trish is not untouchable.,NOT
freelee you should do a video to help trisha give her all the info she needs to make sure she gets all the nutrients and carbs it would also help people wanting to go vegan,NOT
it is messed up to arrest the vegan activist just because they are standing up for animals it doesn't make any sense and it is really horrible that the fires are going on it is all because of animal agriculture we must do something about it now or else 05 it is going to be too late.,NOT
its very obviously a trolling vid people need to just move on she does these things every few months when her socialblade slows,NOT
it's just a publicity stunt for both of their channels,NOT
this question just makes it all mess up if women earn less than men why don't companies only hire women?,NOT
what i want is a study done on is the like to dislike gap actually don't bother...😂,NOT
it's interesting how most of these anti-feminists are by women.,NOT
are we just going to say that women get paid less than men even though in 4 out of 5 of the wealthiest cities in america women make an average of percent more than men this statistic kinda destroys the whole argument that there is sexism not to mention women on average work fewer hours additionally women are less frontal so in a job like a business they would probably not be very good at it for the reasons you said and others business would be a terrible job option for women and to say that is due to sexism is ridiculous because of a male babysitter makes horribly less money than a female one yet no one chalks that up to sexism men will do a worse job when it comes to caring for children just like how women will struggle in jobs that require force its all biological yes women can display force but biologically they aren't forceful vox fortunatley took a factual approach to this and not just outright saying that sexism is the reason as i have seen people do in the past but saying that women jsut need to blanket get paid the same as men are stupid we need to look on a more individual level try to find a women who does the same exact hours as a man has the same experience has the same job and does literally everything the same as the man and she does the same level of quality as the man and i guantee you she will get paid the same amount unless you look at another statisctic which states that women are 0 less liekly to push for more money this is alos led to a gap not because of sexism but due to bioligical inscurities.,ABU
as a gay man i don't find this offensive i just see a person explaining how they feel and just trying to figure out their identity as a person,NOT

my experience with private tutoring in math and science shows women make 40-50/hour and men 20/hr demand is much higher for female tutors.,NOT
thank you so many people are coming out as nb for clout and it is so disrespectful and annoying.,NOT
if you don't want to watch the whole thing it's just her confusing gender identity and sexual orientation.. she is a gay man physically/mentally now because she likes men ..who are also gay and that leads her to believe that she must be a man on the inside. if i may add as a cisfemale i also find the gay men she features on her channel to be extremely attractive but i know that is one sided on my behalf as their sexual orientation doesn't match mine but trisha seems to believe becoming a gay man will solve this dilemma of one sided attractions ,NOT

so essentially this video pushes the idea that women need to be given advantages over men in the workplace in order for them to earn the same amount of money to fix a non-issue how egalitarian!,NOT
veganism is a disease of the mind a delusion and mental illness of the 1st century.,NOT
honestly what bothers me is treating the men as the bad guy in this statistic i mean the use the fact a lot of women want to have kids as the big reason for the gap or the fact many women would just stay home with the kids however there is sth that doesn't get adressed mainly . well if a woman stays home who do you think needs to earn more to support that yeah a man i swear it like this statistic tries to frame men as these greedy bastards cheating women out of their money but.. if the woman stays home with kids that leaves the man responsible to earn money for that woman with kids so this horrible image of a man cheating woman out of her money is in fact earning money for the family why is this never brought up?,NOT
i was so confused when i saw the video,NOT
what the actual crap i was just on ur sc and u at chicken and waffles!!! liar.,NOT
the reason is because they don't work as much as men men normally take more over time and less vactions,NOT
blaire the amount of patience you have to actually watch trisha's video longer then a minute you're so brave,NOT
the gender wage gap by definition simply looks only at the average median earnings of both sexes therefore this video subconsciously agrees that it exists it simply misunderstood the definition as men getting paid more for equal work which rarely happens in developed countries),NOT
there is no wage gap it's not a fact.,NOT
i love this women.,NOT
wow vox i was honestly surprised at how unbiased this was i clicked it groaning thinking oh great a feminist propaganda piece... color me surprised!,NOT

equal rights yes equal outcome no so everything is ok.,NOT
as someone with actual gender dysphoria and who identifies as trans this really pisses me off it's people like trisha who have a large platform and spread wrong information about the transgender community everything she said in this video is wrong i'm not saying that she's wrong or anything but i think she's confused and she doesn't actually know what she's saying she needs to go see a therapist or something and get this figured out before spreading it on social media she needs someone to tell her the difference between feeling more masculine tomboy versus being transgender and having actual gender dysphoria after all she did say that she identified with her sex 000% which you don't find in non binary people trans people or whatever.,NOT
watch the vegan couple's videos!!!,NOT

if piers morgan was told that the vegan sausage roll was real meat....he would say it was nice...but the stupid pratt is so against veganism and hates anything that's vegan. it just goes to show what an absolute idiot he is.,ABU
you know what i like this video its not just some ignorant feminists saying we earn less because sexism! i tend to take arguments in which certain properties of a group of people are the focus rather than their defining qualities here they dont say women earn less because sexism but rather that women earn less because they take different jobs or that women and men in the same field dont make as much because women tend to work less or care more for children and what not good job vox you're actually educating people.,NOT

there is still an unaccounted pay gap that can't be explained by less experience or choice of workhours but that gap is only about ~8% not the 0 or more some people throw around still a gap is a gap and worth trying to close although socio-economic issues can still have effects long after the innitial cause is solved meaning that policy regarding the gap shouldn't be too radical or prevention of yesterdays problems.,NOT

trisha knows exactly what to do to get attention and people just need to stop giving it to her.,NOT
title there is no gender wage gap goes on to talk about how there is in fact a gender wage gap but don't worry if you make good choices then you can shrink it all the way down to a . cent difference which essentially means that even if you play your cards right you will be paid . percent less if you're a woman than if you're a man also want to point out how this lady goes and talks in a video about how bad boys are doing in school and getting worse grades than girls mainly because they spend too much time outside and therefore we need to change the system so that it can benefit them basically when it comes to girls it's their job to adjust their choices to adapt to a system clearly built against them but when it comes to boys it's the opposite since even though their poor performance in school is solely due to their own decisions we must change the system to benefit them yeah these guys basically just tell right-wing people what they want to hear friendly reminder that prager u is predominately funded by an oil tycoon and then comes out with a video called why you should love fossil fuels.”,NOT

anyone who's seriously hurt from this truly needs some thicker skin let's talk about the bigger issue here... why are we giving so much power to one person's thoughts?,NOT
there isn't a gender wage gap there is a flaw in the age wage system though someone who's 8-2 will receive less per hour because of their age and everyone 5 are entitled to more how so some 9-2 year olds have houses kids etc and some people over  don't some younger people may put more effort in and don't doze about like some over 5s do but because of their age they're paid less or more so much mucking about how about paying more based on experience effort and responsibility rather than their age then there's noncewood and indoctrination centres known as schools and most braindead politicians the ones that don't live in the real world just have beans and crisps and shut up you hypocritical virtue signalling nonces greed that's all it comes down to today and why we have such a dysfunctional system that affects many people especially younger).,NOT

ok i am  yrs old and have always been told i am observer of the human scene and i have witnessed something interesting these gender wage gap surveys can't be generalized for every and all jobs i have witnessed half a dozen examples where women actually make more than men in some industries doesn't anyone say anything about that no because of the modern feminist movement fact is that we're human beings and we usually gravitate toward a man or woman when a seeking a service or a product need an example i used to work as a bartender and server i cleared more tips in a day than my male counterparts cleared in a week need something further up the food chain i disagree with what this lady said about male nurses as i used to work in a hospital and heard the stories about nurses even with male nurses who would chat with me when days were slow i have witnessed first hand that female nurses get paid more than their male counterparts to the point that there male counterparts have to go on welfare because they can make enough to even pay their bills even you are a doctor at times a person will gravitate more toward a woman or a man example women who are gynecologists dermatologists acupuncturists psychiatrists psychologists alternative health professionals get paid more than their male counterparts how do i know this i work as medical biller and have done this job for  years doing bills for various healthcare professionals so is there a gender pay gap no i have come to the conclusion that it all just depends on where you are in the world how you work etc,NOT
equal work um no in most jobs men perform better that's the reason for the wage gap,NOT
you dumb feminists need to learn this if women are paid less than men why are companies not hiring women then and saving money on salaries it would only make sense right why would an employer purposefully want to pay more to a guy when they can a woman to do the same job for less this is capitalism folks and your fukin tricks on how the wage gaps are a sexism thing is actually nuts,ABU

it was much better when women could just get a job when they get out of school have a family retire to look after the kids they didn't have to worry about work because there was more money available to pay their husbands wage now we have these feminazis who want women to work their arse off to prove some psychological point that women can work as well whereas before they could relax have a nice quiet life now we have this wage gap myth that is splitting people apart whereas before it was you either had a good paying job or a minimum wage job.,NOT

"you know what people keep focusing on the different pay for the same job thing but they're missing a bigger picture men in america i'm not sure about elsewhere) can drop out of high school join a union where they get paid while they train get full benefits and really good wages they can learn these trades from their dad uncle anyone really while they grow up and have a job that pays them really well right at the start of their life my dad knows how to do all kinds of skilled trades but if i tried to ask him what he working on he'd say i was in his light and tell me to go play he's teaching my little brother about fixing cars of course and i'm glad when i graduated i got a job as a housekeeper at days inn i was paid based on the number of rooms i was assigned to clean and given  minutes to clean them after that times up i'm working for free i made 5.2 an hour and worked my ass off but made at most 12 a week working full time then i got job after job making  at the most women's work doesn't pay well it just doesn't so i thought i wanna make money like the guys do i'll work hard i'm not scared of labor and went to school for welding turns out i loved it looooved it i loved every part of my job in and of itself however i didn't love the harassment and bullying i had to deal with i wasn't walking in with a pink helmet and crying girl power or anything ridiculous i wore sports bras a jumpsuit and made a point to be polite to everyone i crossed paths with while keeping to myself and staying out of any nonsense it turns out even if i keep to myself and try to not start any drama when you're the only woman in a building with over 0 men someone some jerk will have a problem with you based solely on the fact they think you shouldn't be there that one jerk will multiply quickly then you find the guys you thought were your friends coming up and telling you i hate what's happening to you it's not right you're a hard worker and you do a great job but i just want you to know that i'll never defend you you'll be gone eventually they'll make sure of it and i'll be the next target if i do"" point is they say well women can do those jobs now too if they want to and while that's true and not every woman's experience it was for me i'm not talking about being flirted with either i can handle that i had a manger from a department that was totally unrelated to mine slamming his breaks in front of me on the highway and trying to drive me into a wall over and over leaving work one day i didn't even know who it was or why it was happening until the next day when i saw him get out of the same car no road rage cutting anyone off riding anyone's ass type of thing that's just one example out of many i can give forget about the unequal pay for the same job part where's the union with paid training for women's work"" i mean it sounds almost stupid to say out loud but where's the cleaners union or the secretaries union or whatever job women are supposedly naturally good at"" the other day i paid a guy 12 to hook up my internet he was hours late it took him  minutes i gave him a beer and a taco to go home with he seriously showed up at  pm) i cleaned someone's house the other day for 60 the lady had small children she homeschooled and the house was a disaster i felt bad for her and wound up spending most of my money on supplies/gas and it took hours to clean it was a waste of time honestly but no one seems to think anything of paying women basically nothing when they hire them but pay an electrician or plumber astronomically more money that's the problem no one questions that when women were originally allowed to work they typically had husband's that made the money and the women just supplemented the income so it wasn't a big deal to pay women less but we're still living on that base model today and people aren't getting married after high school now i'm  and single and take care of myself it's not like that anymore.",NOT
love ya trish but i'm taking a break for a bit i pray you figure stuff out and god speed.,NOT
ask for your drink to be made with coconut milk at starbucks,NOT
the thing about vegan is that it's litterally no animal type food whatsoever like no eggs milk ofcorse chicken hamburgers etc soups n tbings like that and because you arent eating eat you definitely have to find a good source of protein so like lotssss of beans and sometimes vegans will have to take protien supplements but have to watch what they are other than that just making sure you are balanced then you could probably eat as much as you want there are also other diets like the kill catch grow method which is if you don't kill catch or grow it then don't eat it or there is paleo or vegetarian plenty of things to try just really have to find what works for you so that if you want to then you could have it be a life style instead of just a few weeks type of thing ),NOT

so we really gonna do this😐,NOT
cant wait for freelee's reaction,NOT
no more cake? how will you breathe?!,NOT
"every job i have had men and women got paid the same wage and yet i can create a wage gap very simply within that job example my wife and i work in the same job doing the same hours and getting the same hourly wage we both start the job at  years old and work until we retire we don't have kids and both take the same days off but my wife earns less than me how retirement age men are forced to work for years more than women in the uk even though women live longer so even if i we get the exact same wage it results in a pay gap the gap being the years wages the man earns extra because he cant claim a pension at the same age on top of that paying a woman less than a man for the same job is against the law so if the pay gap was this big then most women would be taking the employer to court and winning which is very easy to do if this is the case focusing on the pay gap in this way is useless and it does not actually look at problems with wages for both men and women paying the top person in a museum 350,00 a year when the rest of the staff are volunteers is wrong political staff being given 35 for travel an food each day when they only live  miles away is wrong zero hours contracts so that people can be screwed over by the company they work for is wrong both men and women are getting screwed over with regards to wage issues and focusing on a wage gap which is already abolished by law is the least of the problems",NOT
the video correctly points out the disproportional amount of time women spend on child rearing duties some of these duties are dictated by nature pregnancy breast feeding etc to the extend that the gap in the remaining duties can be closed i would say this women who are bothered by this gap should choose partners that are on board with a 0/5 split in those duties but please spare us any grand social engineering schemes that try to correct this imbalance at a societal level.,NOT
yaaaaaaaasssssssss!!!! so happy to hear this it's amazing! the vegan community is here for you girl!: carbs carbs carbs eat those and you will get thin and healthy and feel fantastic so excited for you! try banana nice cream!,NOT
finally someone said it,NOT
lol the insinutation that trisha gigi aren't very intelligent ok dexter.,NOT
you forget to say that it's the choice of the woman not to go to those late meetings or to stay late for work you also didn't mention that men are far more likely to ask for a raise wouldn't that mean that men would get raises more than women also if the wage gap were a real thing wouldn't all business owners only hire women so they could pay them less and save money the wage gap comes down to the choices of workers this really shouldn't be a hot topic in the us,NOT
feminist what the hell i'm getting paid just one dollar when this man is getting paid quarters that's a to ratio sexism!,NOT
trisha your following is far too large for this madness and this is not a topic to toy with.,NOT
"you do not want to close the wage gap the reason you have it is because you are using an average in the calculation which is not something you should ever do with a trinomial distribution the average is based on the whole male and female population and does not take into account that you have three distinct different groups low income earners"" medium income earners and high income earners"" and you have a difference between the male and female demographics in these three groups this is what causes the wage gap for example just to illustrate this) say that the low income is 40k aud the average wage in oz is 80k aud a year an high income is 160k a year we set that to be exactly the same for both men and women then we place 0 of women in low pay jobs 0 or women in medium paid jobs and 0 in high pay jobs for men we set 0 in low pay jobs 0 in medium paid jobs and 0 in high paid jobs now we calculate the average women . 0k . 0k . 60k 80,00 a year men . 0k . 0k . 60k 96,00 a year wage gap 80,00 6,00 .83333... difference . 0.8333 .16666.. so the wage gape is about 7 in this example note here that the wages are identical for all men and women the only thing that differs is the number of males and females in each group so if you want to close this wage gap you can do that in ways  all people get the same wage irrespective of job this is communism and state controlled wage-setting  we demand the same number of men and women in all jobs in society this is again state control over who get to work where and again communism we have over 0 years of data based on communism it doesn't work and leads to tyranny this is why we don't want to close the wage gap because the way to do it tyrannical.",NOT
so nowwe have proof men are smarter and make more hahaha women have children so that's 01 the rest is just because women don't do the same job.,ABU

i wish i was a vegan i'd be so thin!!! just that i strongly believe that pesticides in plants are probably more deadly than the stuff they put in meat also most fruit and veggies are covered in gmo stuff and pesticides and i think that's gross i want to be supper skinny and i don't think a plant based diet will get me there plant based diet will probably get you cancer once you people understand what gmo's are i don't hate vegans and i'm sure there are intelligent vegans that grow their own gmo free food tap water is also kinda gross with fluoride so maybe y'all can use rain water for plants just saying that it's so hard to avoid being poisoned these days and veganism is almost like a prop to make people believe they are eating healthy unpoisoned food.,NOT
stop this trish you are just trying to get freelee to gain back her subscribers you guys are totally in on it,NOT
honestly as a transman i laughed at her video i was offended at first but now i just laugh at it because it's so ridiculous,NOT
no real economist supports the wage gap.,NOT
stop by target and get some gardein food brand..will help you replace fish and chicken.,NOT
there a lots of other factors you skipped over women typically work fewer overtime hours and use more of their vacation and sick days the whole wage gap basically boils down to the choices people make and not their gender.,NOT
but people on the comments are even watched the video?? anyway just educate all people to help in domestic commission and help rise children.. but sometimes seems that both genders want just to complain,NOT
"copied from chris does vox realise that its main points disproved the theory of the wage gap completely i tried to sit here for half an hour to collect counter arguments to all your points considering that people in the comments are arguing that people didn't watch the video i managed to cut it down to a few points  your statistics in a few areas only correlated to certain fields of work e.g business) this creates a misleading argument in the statement you made you also did not reveal the ratio of men women in the graduate pool so its very difficult to accurately say that men had higher salaries out the gate"" do you mean on average or in the whole what jobs did they take with what companies this doesn't account for peoples choices out of school argument looked at thousands of men and women who graduated from 99 006 men earned more out the gate""  it's a fact that many years ago women were actively payed less than men for the same jobs its completely ridiculous that you are using arguments from 97 all the way back to 948 i mean really? 948? the difference begins shrinking because of pay equality you absolute morons as they approach their 0's and 0's was moving into a time where sexism in the workplace was actively being tackled pay was becoming equal so of course the gap closed it really has nothing to do with pregnancy at this point argument :25 if you look at women born 973... same thing for women 968.. 948....  if you do want to argue pregnancy in a relationship it is two peoples choices to have a child having a child has consequences good and bad you have a child you work less to take care of that child perhaps women do take on a disproportionate share of responsibilities but it is up too the people in the relationship to decide who does what we have maternity leave for a reason for both male and females argument :10  these statistics dont take into account the actual jobs themselves its illegal to pay women less these statistics and the way you are phrasing them are misleading stop saying the word pay women aren't payed less they earn less yearly because of their choices in the job argument :45  if you dont show up for work or can't work the same hours as a man you are not going to be payed as much i dont care if your pregnant i dont care if you are lazy you dont show up you dont get payed you are contradicting yourself because it sounds like you are saying women have children which force them to have time off but we should make jobs more flexible for them if you choose a job with less flexible hours thats a choice you made society doesn't have too pander to fit your every need argument some jobs require really specific hours not available to her clients when they need her"" :30 i could go on but this is boring now your still citing statistics from the 970s to fit whatever agenda you are pushing in 017 so congratz if you wanted too prove that the wage gap only happens now because women work less hours you did it women aren't paid less than men so too call it a wage gap is totally misleading women get the same salary as man women earn less than men yearly on the whole because of their choices jobs hours etc this entire video was confusing and misleading it sounded like you were saying women are payed less then you were saying they weren't but all i took out of it was that in order to shrink the wage gap we need to make jobs more flexable for women"" the simple answer is no btw i cited every source i could in your video every point i made has your quotes and even the video times you quoted a lot of studies is it that hard too add them too the description?",NOT
wtf 00k usd per year whaat,NOT
how do we fix the gender wage gap does a mind-shift happen at home where men share the household work equally with women or is there some policies or change at work that can reduce the gender wage gap?,NOT
while the problem is actually different than the one advertised it is a problem nonetheless encouraging women to choose the higher paying careers needs to take place as does increasing the wage for the lowest paying careers.,NOT

this isn't fair to the other females on the team i have nothing against transgenders but at the end of the day their birth certificates says male they are physically stronger than born females! males competing against females is unfair which is why gender sports are separated  maybe someone should start a team with transgenders this is taking away scholarships from the other girls,ABU

people read into statistics to much me and my wife worked full time i made 0 more then her she worked  hours a week i worked 0 now the kids are grown and our income reversed she makes 0 more then me we both work 0-5 hours a week very typical of american families.why does everyone devalue women that make the decision to raise children into successful human being materialism is killing america and the rest of the world.,NOT
even though many things in this video are correct we shouldn't forget that the main driving factor in wage gap today is having kids women without kids in the first world countries earn the same as men women with very much not the same goes for men if they are the primary care taker but due to traditional gender roles this is rare this is what the gender gap is primarily about.,NOT
"according to the broadcast why is women's soccer so white? one of the main reasons for it is that that these youth players are preferring to play for clubs rather than just to play high school soccer they see the need to play for clubs because since the women's soccer is not as major as for the men's soccer team despite of how well they perform as compared to the men it was mentioned that some clubs were as high as 7,00 per teenage girl when we compare national team clubs to high school soccer it is notable that not everyone will have that type of money to pay for their girls to go off to play it all has to do with socioeconomic and the parents who have this type of money due to their higher incomes are white thus this is one big reason why there is so little diversity in the women's soccer team shifting to the video there is no gender gap the overall message is that there is only a  wage gap and not more as others make it seem they mention how basically it is the women's fault because of their career options which impacts how much money they make however what they don't realize is that out of all the job options they have there is only 04 of jobs that pay women and men equal so how are they expected to choose wisely when there is hardly any options for them to choose from it is sad to see how even with the same education the gap still remains just because women are seen as less reliant because they are not able to work at all times due to motherhood and all the other household responsibilities women have on top of work they mention how it is not sexism but all of the previous states otherwise how men are more capable of doing certain jobs and they are less of a burden for employers moreover according to adams et al of section classism women's average pay is at 7 of men's compensation throughout their whole career women only make 4 of what men make it was mentioned in the reading how discrimination is part of it but also because women are not always able to work the full time and thus if you need to be absent for a period of time from work it is a stiff penalty in declining their career and slashing the pay the lack of daycare and flexible job options makes it really hard for a woman to work the same amount of hours as a man overall i think it is important to analyze this further and note how it is not that they are not telling us the truth or they are doing bad math they are sharing the actual facts and truth on what women have to deal with.",NOT
i love it when the left paints itself into a corner which is happening a lot these days.,NOT
lmao nah they gotta run against the boys that's like me growing into an adult but then felt like a kid at heart so i wanted to compete against other kids..,ABU

i've never seen so many thumbs down on a video in a long time i'm pleasantly surprised trisha stop this i mean she could be gendefluid but sometimes she just does stuff for publicity she's for sure not a man at least.,NOT

when i first saw this i thiught she was just doing it just cause its trendinf every where,NOT
tl:dr there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap meaning all men put together earn more than all women put together which is because men work higher paying jobs more dangerous jobs and more hours for the same exact work and same exact hours men and women are paid the same.,NOT
vox is far left propaganda the wage gap is a myth.,NOT
it sucks that people can't just let her do what she wants and not complain and fucking cry about everything.,NOT
its funny how when you search wage gap in youtube this video isn't at the top despite having the most viewer traffic.,NOT
i came here ready to disagree im so glad we are finally starting to address the real issue instead of focusing on a fake one.,NOT
wait why were the woman paid less than men in their jobs after college?,NOT
i support them as being transgender bc it can be hard but it is not far for them to compete with the girls cuz i watched the rd place girl's interview and she was devastated and she made valid points and also it is so obvious their guys so common sense would tell u maybe something is off u know i want to hear yalls thoughts bc this is a touchy subject,ABU
i'm pretty sure you guys have already made a video on the wage gap why another one?,NOT

ahhhh this vid made me so happy,NOT
i'm just gonna put this out here 5000 dollars is not 0 less than 00000,NOT
no it's called an earnings gap you autists and it's mainly because men usually have higher-paying jobs and as far as i know tend to keep their jobs for longer amounts of time on average besides that there's a variety of different reasons for different pay averages.,NOT
1 women work less hours on average  women are less likely to ask for a raise this explains the wage gap within same occupations.,NOT
i'm very tired as of now and what i'm getting out of this is that most women who are earning less are doing so because many of them have children to take care of so they're missing hours the solution is that work hours could be made more flexible is that what she's saying here if so couldn't a better solution be to raise the wage of women with children who are single/unsupported please note that i am not very educated in this field so i'm just making a solution based on what i've observed from this video p,NOT
australias money interest in animal products cows in particular is so obvious it's mind boggling they've confused the public through media from what is actually going on to a shameful degree what really stood out was around the time of the nation wide vegan protesting this year most people i spoke to didn't really know why they were protesting and why they took some animals they literally thought it was some random petty overly emotional people just trying to make problems no clue of the reality of the situation plant-based vegan is definitely moving forward as the new generation has access to more information and conversation.,NOT

u cant just go vegan u have to go into it not just eat fruit,NOT

feminist get these ideas from joke comments in youtube,NOT
so they should compare men who take on the majority of house hold and child responsibilities and women to compare to see how that sizes up because this seems to be much more of a cultural structure thing than an actual pay thing...,NOT
women working aren't attractive at all sorry dried up cat ladies.,ABU
how does she get a pass every time she acts like the town fool she's a joke.,NOT
thank you freelee for your impact on the world ️❤️,NOT
the fact that this is a debate is concerning....,NOT
your cat is adorable,NOT
"""let me show you my reaction has liked and watched beforehand",NOT
lots of these facts are actually outdated the top best paying job statistics was from years ago whilst the worst was years ago during this year gap colleges have progressively invited more female students into colleges and some of the best fulfilling colleges don't accept women as often even today also you account women's maternity leave yet not a man's so that the gap seems closer i think both the extremist feminists and conservatives are both fabricating statistics the gap is more like  cents and there needs to be something done about it in an equality based manner.,NOT
we eat whole plant foods with least ount of processing not sure all the fake meat is good but probably better than animal products as to the environment it might be too late but at least we can go to hell with a clear conscience!,NOT
i mean trisha could be bigender.,NOT
princess treatment of girls is the curse that make them vulnerable on reality check lessons taught to boys must be taught to girls ) learn skills to fix your others problems as no god or man will come to fix those ) generate resources add value b being consumer ) go to point b before even thinking about babies i myself was a born artist i gave it up to become engineer as art only adds problems engineering provides solutions.,NOT
what people miss about the gender pay gap . it does not exist,NOT
there's no gender wage gap it's an earnings gap wage is the same for men and women they earn less or more if they work less or more hours,NOT
sms bish wat,NOT
congratulations you work fewer hours than others expect less overall pay you work more hours than others expect more pay that wasn't hard to figure out.,NOT
this is 00 a trolling video.,NOT
deep throating a banana the trish style dead freelee,NOT
can i get the links to external sources,NOT
as far as i know don't women earn more than men in part time jobs as well as in the age gap between 6-25 although only very slightly statistics like the .7 or .7 cent per dollar wage are very misleading as it doesn't take into account stuff like stereotypes social norms segregation in the labour market and the other general differences between women and men.,NOT
i should be happy after watching this because veganism is spreading faster and faster  but i am not because there are so many no-brainers in the world.. i got a headache when i saw those raw meat imbeciles.. i've been vegan for  months i know not that long) but people like them still break my heart ,NOT
i'm so happy that she's finally giving it a try freelee this just shows again that you're not some bully but someone who really influences people i mean with trisha i never thought i'd see the day in the best way keep doing what youre doing love you  xx,NOT
lots of veggies cucumbers carrots celery with hummus is great just make sure you eat more veggies than fruit fruit has a lot of sugar ),NOT
i do agree in most of the video but there's a point that wasn't mention for a guy is easier to get most of the well paid jobs than a woman also uneducated jobs are mostly male dominated like construction or gardening there's a social experiment in which a boss was sent cvs one female and one male in different professions most of the bosses including female one picked the male rather than the female as we have this patriarcal thought that male workers have more time or are more committed to their jobs also i come from colombia a country with a huge sexism in here is even illegal for women to have certain jobs.,NOT
i cant believe you would just flash ur pussy like that at the end of the video shameful d,NOT
i love soaking tofu in some of my favorite flavors overnight like bbq buffalo or general tsos sause and baking it for dinner.,NOT

you make the decision on this one but i'd recommend closing the comments on this vid as they tend to be a septic tank on topics like this,NOT
i'm going vegan tomorrow starting 02 fresh.,NOT
an nra tv ad on this video ... yeah youtube get your shit together,NOT
you know why men are paid more because guess who has to stay behind when a building is on fire or a ship sinking you mean i can't get a lousey dollar more?,NOT
the reason i'm putting this on the internet is i want views and i want to be part of the drama lmao,NOT
they are not girls!! you can identify as a baby or a cow or a baby cow but it would not make you one hormone therapy does not make you a girl it does not override the fact you had four times the testosterone developing your muscles and bones since birth not to mention they went through most of puberty as boys this is permanent they are winning not because they are talented but because they are boys racing in a girls race some the comments here are alarming haley how is it cheating? how are you that ignorant what are they teaching kids in school today are they afraid to tell them the truth so they lie and tell them hormone therapy takes away the advantage seriously so we are raising a society of imbeciles for the sake of not offending trans people wtf!!!,ABU
"i'm more than happy to go vegan/plant based i'm not prepared to take a gamble on the future of the planet and live ignorance its all our problem if we don't change we do so at our peril we're all going to end up like the film soylent green""🤪",NOT
maybe the jobs this woman has been paid for has been equal but i have had jobs that i was paid less for than the male coworkers i got paid as much as 1.50/hr than men i worked with even though they came to the job a year after me.,NOT
good on the girls who came forward to stop this look at the actual girls participating they are losing out on opportunities that can put them in possible better schools down the track if you choose to identify as a women then you cant represent the school too much room for cheating,NOT
did you ever go back and confront her on why she didn't keep up with the change?,NOT
did anyone consider the causality is the other way around jobs with more women get paid less just because the majority are women that would be sexist and when you honestly consider it you realize its true,NOT
this transgender thing is an illusion ,ABU
wait this pargeru video has evidence fats and sound logic if more of their videos were like this i would actually take them seriously.,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap white women make much closer salary to men while latina and black women make much much lower on the dollar and asian women usually make close to or higher than white women any discussion of the gender pay gap that ignores race is incomplete at best,NOT
couldn't have explained it better myself i hope more people keep watching this video thanks.,NOT
these radical feminists don't understand how math works how economy works.,NOT

okay so they are men who identify as women and use hormones which allows them to compete against women or people who identify as women i'm so confused.,NOT
we need to call out bolsonaro and his cronies preferably we need to create and sign a petition to hold him accountable for the destruction of the amazon and the earth he and his family are militia criminals that will do everything for money.,ABU
i guess trying to be black got boring for her so now she wants to try her hand at trans she makes it so hard to actually like her and stand up for her.,NOT
also if the wage gap is still in men's favor take into account that maternity leave is paid and that women live longer so they get more out of social security,NOT
women and men have the same rights in the western world it is all about the choices we make most women choose easier career paths and work less hours to raise children that is their own choice there is nothing wrong about it in the west men and women also share home care duties and raise children together in the western world job vacancies are offered to women and men at the same wage most men are more flexible and work long hours that is why they can make more money feminists hate independent women and use them to escalate in politics and in the company they are selfish beings feminists detest men but use them they want to share the partner's bank account to also spend his salary and not happy with that they claim half of the man's assets and a pension when they divorce strong independent women never stop educating themselves overcoming bad times working hard being responsible and fair with men strong women do not fall into feminists fallacies.. there is not such a gender wage gap strong women respect men and women alike because independent women look far beyond the genre real women praise the individual feminists created a women day only aka discriminating men! how low this is would feminists feel happy if men declare a day only for themselves?? let's stop with this game!!,ABU
didn't most citizens vote for gay rights didn't most still fight for lg   what ever it's called now you complain oh it's a little late for that now don't you think what the hell were you people thinking pedophiles acceptance will be next...... sick and shameless nation,ABU

i can't believe trisha's logic she thinks that she's trans and cis at the same time while thinking that she's black while she's pale as fuck.,ABU
no just another video for shock and awe and of course attention seeking.,NOT
everyone one knows blacks are better athletes that's a given but now non black girls have to compete against black guys?!?!?!,ABU
something that made me go vegetarian was that you are literally eating a corpse it just grosses me out i wouldn't eat a human corpse so why an animal corpse.,NOT
vegan diet is honestly the most annoying phrase veganism shouldn't be a diet it should be a lifestyle choice.,NOT
wow not click bait this time am i at the right channel ,NOT
she said for weeks,NOT
so the pay gap is basically between mom and others then isn't the issue when women get pregnant women have no other choice but take care of kids and work less while men have no choice but work harder if there is more support for working moms such as childcare and paternity leave this situation will be better.,NOT
this better not be clickbait,NOT
it's been illegal to pay woman differently since the 0's,NOT

nice sensible video for once good arguments make for a healthier debate instead of uneducated fools running their mouths.,NOT
this is all set up for the people who really run this world they strategically put these young boys as transgenders to see if they could get away with it to see how much backlash they are going to get from this because it is all fake especially the parents look fake the number one thing is track for the parent what about these are boys they are not girls their boys i don't care what they do they will always and forever be a boy sorry but i'm not sorry cuz that is the way that god made them so they need to go run on the track with the boys and dressed like girls and run with them.,ABU
they're still men...,ABU
it is naive to think that simply by going vegan will resolve our environmental issues yes it could end animal factory farming but the multinationals will move on to cutting down forests creating gmos and decimating the earth the conversation must include limiting the power of corporations...but they have the power of american law the presidency and advanced propaganda media at their disposal there is great suffering for mankind ahead only then will we have the will to change....going vegan anyway...,NOT
bruh there is no wage gap the only gap there is is the iq gap between normal people and feminists because they can't even do math right.,NOT
other girls should just faster.... hang on mate you're not a girl.,ABU
this video is pure gold and.. statistically more men work around the clock  hours a day to create provide for and protect us all everything that can't close or stop for a minute statistically more men pilots truckers trains ships surgeons cops firemen factory work soldiers engineers tradesmen fbi cia large farms and ranches utilities like water treatment plants infastructure work oil field work etcetera... it brings a tear to my female eye much respect for both sexes out there that are actually making good things happen and actually contributing i wish videos like these could replace commercials.,NOT
omg the first thing that popped in my head was is she on crack? the dry mouth over accentuating definitely something else going on.,ABU

aww trish this makes me so happy try to really stick with this change for weeks eat until you're satisfied if you get cravings/feel hunger eat more you'll be amazed how good you'll feel after just one-two weeks and hopefully you'll want to continue  good luck to you you'll be so much happier if you change your diet tons happier.,NOT
i love you so much blaire you are the best transwoman in the world,NOT
seeing it from the perspective of the miller's this problem is a lot more complex than it seems.,NOT
no she's confused or just being trisha tomorrow she'll be a dolphin ,NOT
i go through periods of subscribing unsubscribing and resubscribing to you... just resubscribed i don't agree with a lot of your motives which is more on me than you due to my severe ed background and mental health activism so any type of video commentary on another's body sets me off) still i always wind up coming back to you because there really is such a sweetness and kindness that just radiates from you.. i really believe that this is why so many people watch you you're the kind of person that just draws people in i think it would be cool to make a video on junkier vegan foods and/or meat alternatives for trisha i know the goal is partly health but i really believe that if she is exposed to just how many delicious vegan chips and pastries and whatever are out there she may begin to see just how sustainable and restrictive veganism is just a thought  3,NOT
if you confine your research to married working couples then why should the wage gap even matter at all the household is going to benefit if one party is being paid more regardless of who that party happens to be.,NOT
it's also okay not to put a label on your diet if this doesn't work out instead of saying shit i'll start tomorrow that had dairy or i ate meat by mistake guess that's it it's not about winning an award for the longest streak of no meat or dairy it's about making healthier choices i cut out red meat like or years ago and yes i've had a few slip ups by accident but honestly my body is so much healthier and happier when i'm fueling it right so don't worry about a specific label of vegan or vegetarian live in the moment eat what makes your body feel good and that will make all the difference,NOT

reads the title me that it doesn't exist any who pls be more realistic vox men stay in work longer studies over short long periods of time show men are more likely to ask for raises and ask for more hours its statistically proven that woman take more leaves then men on a : scale this also doesn't account for that nearly the entire part time work force strictly consists of woman why should an employers pay a part timer as much as a full timer woman in they're twenties and forties are out partying and going through jobs until they finally settle down with someone when they start to have a kid it's only till near retirement age when this so called gender age gap is nonexistent because men and woman are working full time at the same rate you idiots forget to look at presented facts because you know the gender pay gap is baloney no serious economist not even female economist take this gender pay gap serious the new third reich yes i said that of feminism is unneeded it's just an escape hole for feminist to bash men if we paid woman less then why wouldn't we just hire all woman exactly woman in the science field are more likely to get the job then a man trying for the same job with the same qualifications on a : scale woman in the 1st century are privileged yet complain about other people's privilege and the best part is you think you can change things bahahah the first and second wave of feminism is what i agreed with this third wave is just pure bs this is why god brought the flood there is no such thing of a gender pay gap it's utter bullshit.,ABU

i get she's just shitposting but like sis needs mental help,NOT
despite the actually narrow wage gap between men and women in western industrial societies there is still a tendency of women to call on traditional female privileges where in marriage the male was the sole breadwinner when they say to their spouses what's mine is mine and what's yours is ours. it makes a man want to go mgtow men going their own way) i could make an exception as christina hoff sommers would make an interesting date.,NOT
waits for freelee's response,NOT
believe me being a vegan is terrific the cuisine is unlimited never ending options and all superb the fulcral part for me are the animals may ethics surge and compassion and finally the universal rights for animals may humans become humankind with this we will take a giant step to civilization the planet and our lives will begin a new reform and bring us a lifestyle which promotes the best in us.,NOT
thank you trish...i m so happy you re trying the vegan lifestyle,NOT
someone pick up my jaw off the floor pls,NOT

unfair advantage..... is that even a question?!?!?,NOT
ok but why do we perceive female dominated professions as requiring less skills and money etc for example computer programming and coding was considered a low level menial job when it was female dominated yet now coders make oodles of money and the job has a lot of respect we respect physicians yet in russia where medicine is a predominantly female workforce they have no respect for the profession there librarians were once respected and well paid and even now when they have more skills and education than ever before they are laughed at and paid like shit ever since females started dominating the profession teaching was also the same i don't think women are paid less for simply being women i think we value male work over female work if you compare education levels for different jobs you will find that in female dominated industries they will be lower paying than similar levels of education than in male dominated industries since women have taken over the field of biology the median wage has gone down 8% wages for designers fell by 4 when females started to gain ground in the industry of the  top highest paying professions  are male dominated.,NOT
i know what you mean i watch a lot of videos about slaughter houses and i always end up crying through the whole thing i'm so glad i became vegan it has really opened my eyes to how messed up the world is,NOT

question what's with the obsession of ending the wage gap as the video outlined it's not that women are getting paid less for the same work and instead it's more that they're doing less work or working in lower paying fields this is the outcome of those womens choices they chose to go into that lower paying job/field and they chose to work less hours so why does it matter why do we have to try and force changes just so the government can look at national earnings of the sexes and see that they're balanced there's no inherent value to that.,NOT
are you blaire open for recieving fanart and including it in merch?,NOT
this is the most insidiously mysandristic wage gap video on youtube it is good propaganda though it disguises false premise as hard fact and sells anti-male bigotry as pro-female progressiveness nice job vox this is your worst video so far.,NOT

um girls can just be attracted to gay men men are attracted and admire lesbians... girl just love yourself and get help please.,NOT
i think for you it'd just be easier to transition by eating replacements gardein fake meat products are amazing chao cheese is delicious most bread and pita flat breads are vegan scrambled tofu taste really good imo sour patch kids sour cherry blasters are vegan you live in la right there are a lot of vegan restaurants there just do a little google searching over all when you have a craving satisfy it with vegan food eventually you will just want to eat more raw fruits veggies yeah and get used to reading all the labels on the package please do not do the raw food diet it's difficult to get enough calories on that diet and when you o into a calorie deficit you will over compensate and binge eat it's bad also not eating cooked food sucks ass last thing it seems that all the vegan youtubers responded to this so maybe listen to their advice too.,NOT
with trisha the thing is that u dont know like never if she's making a joke or not ...,NOT
trish you are amazing!!,NOT

um its because there are more men workers than woman workers and they work more stupid liberal channel.,NOT
she's like the annoying version of coppercab,NOT
i feel like she relates to men and drag queens and has some common interest with them but is somehow mistaking that for being trans like clearly she does not understand how things work,NOT
this is so fucking wrong how can the fucking school even allow that and these boys running have no right on that track running with girls they feel good about themselves beating girls on the track you would think that they would think them selfs and tell them self i wonder why i'm so much faster??? hmmmm bc god made you a fucking mann!!!! you have man legs there is no running away with that you can see how sick these boys are when you go to the lowest level and tell yourself hmm i wanna feel good and win against girls i would have respect these boys more if they ran with the other boys and still call yourself transgender i can't blv people fall for this shit this is wrong wrong wrong especially to the young women that train and work so dam hard to compete on the track but to only end there senior year with being knocked of district or regionals or even a states to boys that call themselves girls sad,ABU

too bad trish is impressionable and actually believes you are thin because of your vegan diet you have falsely led her to believe she can stuff herself with pasta and carbs as much as she wants she just doesn't realize you're a bulimic currently with a huge eating disorder and if you think you are fooling us all out here.. think again i see the signs you've got atrophy of all your muscles anorexic bulimic we know you throw up your food after your big restaurant meals it's just wrong what you do you're a bully and an awful person just because trish was nice does not mean that you're good you suck in every way possible and you are hurting more people than you help.,ABU

what's the point of eating vegan if you're eating all this processed food impossible meat vegan fired chicken frozen vegan dinners people seem to forget that processed food is how we got so unhealthy in the first place veganism was healthy because people were eating less processed food not in spite of the fact...,NOT

there definitely is a wage gap.,NOT
killing animals is sad we can do better for animals and the planet by going vegan.,NOT
that's why you had bacon and eggs yesterday in your snapchat,NOT
i love you freelee,NOT
its true that there's no wage gap based on gender but why are jobs traditionally placed on women such as teaching valued less than jobs traditionally placed on men such as business) shouldn't jobs such as education be valued more due to how important it is for a functioning society?,NOT
you forgot all the other 0 genders,NOT
trish i've followed you for years and this is music to my ears knowing what the animals go through kills me everyday...so thank you for taking a step forward toward a higher consciousness 3,NOT
anyone who's keeps there mouth shut on this that has kids on that track team in that school are cowardly shits.. you are all sheep you're being controlled by the far left the socialist and the democratic party  these are too big men two big gay men who won't admit they're gay or they're just lying about wanting to be women deep down anyway just so they can play the system and get a total on a unfair advantage to win against women they are not women they are men they are men they were born with men they have big men muscles they are fucking men !!!! before any of you call me homophobic i was raised by a gay man who is a man a male and proud of it and he was also proud to be gay. being gay is a natural biological sexual preference... transgender is bullshit it's people who won't admit that they are gay and the huge evidence supports that..,ABU
i honestly don't like trisha.. she's stupid,NOT
great work freelee ️❤️❤️,NOT
i totally understand that you feel you are a woman inside and you have the right to express that but you have to be honest with yourself you were born with physical advantages that clearly set you apart from cis women,NOT
there is no wage gap just an earnings gap also pay discrimination is illegal.,NOT
if women get payed less why would companies just hire women they will make more profits that way,NOT
i love trish but i feel liek i know her well enough to know there is no way she could stay vegan,NOT
these boys need to be kicked off the team immediately how dare they!?,ABU
if they could pay women less just hire all women but they all get paid the same.,NOT
every time a crazy feminist is asked for evidence .wage gap .all men r** .?? .?? .???,NOT
i can't really watch the whole thing yet since i'm at work but you might want to try it longer than weeks your body is going to need time to adjust to this new healthier lifestyle so you might find that you get tired or feel sluggish your body is just detoxing but once you get past that you'll feel amazing! and you won't crave all those junk foods you used to and then you'll start seeing the weight come off  good luck trish ,NOT
what they're saying isn't necessarily wrong just for the wrong reasons the pharmacy example is incredibly incredibly flawed and the flexible hours reasoning is as well.,NOT
this new wave of feminism we're in currently must go towards tackling breaking down gender stereoptypicsl mentalities and try create equality in the ways that men and women are brought up to think thats the new frontier we should stop focusing on the agendas of second or thirdwave feminism and move towards things like creating a society where boys arnt shamed for displayin vulnerability and emotion where girls are taught that they can reach high positions within their work where both men and women take equal responsibilty over paternal and domestic duties break down gender roles is what im saying its all about how we think now the wage gap is thing of the past and a myth in todays work place im saying this as a feminist ranting and raving about it is only detracting from other work place injustices that women and men encounter feminism isnt dead theres still so far to go but the wage gap just isnt relevant today in the western world love your average local feminist x,NOT
if men truly did make 3 more than women then that would be a truly raw deal for men  men die on the job  times more than women  men are  times more likely to work two jobs and work over time  men have a much much higher injury rate and burn out rate  men have less perks a lot of companies don't have paternity leave  men by far work more dangerous jobs and more remote jobs  men see their families far less  men are the vast majority of combat deaths and for all that men only get 3 more its should be or times more now if the gov forces salaries to be equal then its clearly men who get screwed yes when we hear  women and  men died in a coal mine accident then talk about equality until then men are screwed.,NOT
trisha love and praise goes to you honey,NOT
i'm confused i thought athletes taking any kind of drug or hormones steroids or otherwise was cheating.,NOT

wtf this is not fair at all you need to tell me if i claim to be a woman i can compete in female races coz of suppressing testosterone i'm becoming a millionaire in a year lol.,NOT
debunk the race pay gap,NOT
it is always entertaining the mental gymnastics the trans youtubers present males impersonate females and want to date males . the shortcut is they are actually gay females impersonate males and want to date females . the shortcut is they are actually lesbians the idea that children are born with an innate gender identity which develops pre-natally and is impervious to environmental influence is not supported by any credible science body and brain are interconnected scientists have found no separate innate gender area of the brain which is fixed at birth children's brains are very plastic they develop through interaction with people and the environment and they are constantly absorbing information and influences which shape them.,NOT
maybe the actual issue should be that those low paying jobs should not be so low paying sadly they actual contribute a similar amount to society as any of the high paying jobs...,NOT
"dont eat as much as you want, just eat until you are truly satisfied common misconception misunderstanding the point is you dont have to calorie restrict but you dont overstuff yourself so happy for you hope you enjoy it!",NOT
til gay dudes with a straight guy fetish are straight women,NOT
then theres the question on why womeon get the not as high paying jobs,NOT
you think this is a godd explanation but there is alot of info you leave oute that idont know  when you say men get and wimmen get .79 but you need more info than that .edjucation like you state  is this per houer or at the end of the year then if men work 0 houers in a set time and wimmen work  houers i that same set time is this gap not fair  now i dont know the stats but the fair way of paying someone is not by the houer but by the work so if men does more work in less time but work the same time as wimmen it is only logical that men gets more if they get more work done same if wimmen does more wokr is the same time that men do then wimmen must get more i wil only cal it equalety when someone can say that wimmen and men get the same kind of money for moving this bag of stuf from point a to point b no matter the time it takes you get a set amount of money when the work is done this is fair and until someone can say that men get more for the same job that took the same amount of time if they then get more then the system is not fair then it is fair to pay the guy more if he does it faster depending on the job cus sometimes if you does something a litle slower take your workd and deliver it to someone that then have to do work on it the slower eatch point in the cahain is the slower the total work is done.,NOT
so what do women want do they wan't men to subsidize them so they can work less and still earn the same sorry not gonna happen i work for my own living not anyone else's as it stands women already use and get more benefits from social services than men do even though men are the ones that pump more money into the system because they work more anyway i'm glad the feminist have finally accepted that their  cents for every dollar data is defective and incomplete they never would have accepted that before so this is progress.,NOT
don't eat light weight things like fruit and expect to fill up u gotta eat potatoes beans rice pasta grains this seems so lame and gross but u can make it taste so good like you said how those brussel sprouts were good veggies are good when grilled esp green peppers let your body adjust to the new diet you may gain some weight at first just because you're taking in more calories but veganism will clean out your body and eventually you'll be down to your body's best weight it takes awhile if you're willing to try veganism or even vegetaraianism without dairy you will end up with clear skin and less weight but for most diets to be effective you have to exercise that's why freelee is so toned i don't know if you're even going to read this but i'm really proud of you definitely search some vegan recipes on youtube it makes it so much easier and eating fruit all day instead of filling fiber-rich foods will leave you super hungry and undercarbed :,NOT
you do you boo boo we love you you're amazing fuck what anyone else has to say you're beautiful whatever you want to be you can be it!,NOT

i identify as a baby boa!,NOT
it cant be technically correct with all the differences to many facts keep it from being correct thats like saying all men are rapists because of the few men who did commit rape but the gap between the 9.99 that never committed that crime and the .0 that did can be explained while still saying technically all men are still rapists.,NOT
the number of likes and dislikes on this video speaks for itself.,NOT
your man that what god gave you he dont make mistakes you competing in girls sports is wrong invent your own,ABU
that trisha video disgusts me but all liers for attention disgust me xd but in general the whole movement to use the transgender community for clicks is big oof sometimes they can even hurt real trans people through the bullshit they are talking just in that sense that normal/cis people who see it will get this picture of trans and apply it to everyone they meet in real life who is really trans and treat them badly or in a way they don't deserve to be treated also make more videos with your cat he or she is a cutie xd,NOT

wow this is simply not truth and yes we know why there is this 6.6 gap there are thousands of studies proving that if men were taking care of every single activity that women are expected to do outside their professional activities like working at home cleaning or taking care of kids) women simply could take these men jobs and earn more because there are no naturally men jobs this is not simply a math issue but a gender gap in social responsibilities between women and men and this is science not a myth or any math error by spreading these messages you show a clear ideological point of view and not a scientific one as you want is to believe.,NOT
ha just sent to my sister this should really get her going great video,NOT
trish! you need to watch jess beautician on youtube she had vegan june and posted what she ate everyday and it all looked soooo delicious i've watched it and i'm not even vegan.put me up so she can see this comment lol,NOT
so basically it's more of the various inconveniences that come with strict work hours than it is about sexism like the media makes it out to be this is extremely interesting,NOT
trish when you said that you started to care about animals suffering that's the moment i knew you would succeed if you go on a vegan diet for superficial reasons just to look better trust me it is so mentally destructive you end up feeling like binging just to rebel against a very restrictive regime but if you connect with the animal suffering then eating animal products will not even cross your mind it will not feel like a diet anymore every meal will be you taking a stand against abuse and contributing to a better world it will give your life so much meaning and purpose and bring you so much happiness i promise!,NOT
this movie is a goosebumperrrrr!!!!!! i'm excited for us all our unity will remove animal cruelty forever!!!!!!! mother nature we love you we will save you!!!!!!!!,NOT
yes trisha!!!! don't forget lots and lots of water aim for a gallon a day to help clear your skin for your video and to remove toxins!,NOT
the milk song was funny the carnivores were too people will eventually learn the truth or have disease...it's their choice i'm excited for my own journey it's been amazing so far being vegan i'm so thankful for the information keep inspiring others with your actions and the truth,NOT

why should i care about people making the top  incomes in the united states?,NOT

one word east german women's team then you'll understand,NOT
what people miss on the wage gap is that it don't really exist unless you're a feminist and just want to get paid more for doing less,NOT
this is one of the first good videos on the wage gap i've seen it shows that the gap isn't due to company's being sexist but infact due to the types of jobs men and women tend to take.,NOT
the only thing that i learned from this video is that scientists work self directed and i want to become one know!,NOT
i'm so proud of trish and i'm glad that she's getting the message out there ,NOT
the fact that women are more carrying with children is obvious . women have to stay with kids home while the man goes to work since that happens men gain up to 0 more income bcs they can adapt to the working schedule women better parent men better worker ...a quick summary of the video,ABU
good work thanks,NOT
showing this to the students in my class who still think the wage gap is real even after i explained what the wage gap myth was based on but they didn't understand because they're stupid ,NOT
the biggest thing that no one has mentioned is the fair pay act of 3 it is illegal to pay some one less for the same job my question is why there are not lawsuits for breaking the law oh because only like 0 have been filed so far and more than half of those were found not true.,NOT
seems that one study which was omitted is should be obvious that one which cites the fact that the greatest single explanation for the gap is the fact that women give birth to children and are more involved in raising them if fact when this factor is factored out the wage gap favors women it is much easier for women to exit and reenter the labor force than men women have a much greater number of occupations which are easier for them to exit and re-enter than men women simply have many more employment options generally than men the wage gap is mostly a function of the fact that most men are employed continuously whereas that is less likely for most women..,NOT
is it very graphic could anyone tell please?,NOT
no women make 9 of what men earn it must be patriarchy oppressing women there are no other reasons kappa,NOT
vegan woop woop i am glad that she is making the change that's awesome,NOT
ok if you're doing studies on people making over 00k a year and then comparing wage gaps then i want nothing to do with this.. this seems like an elitist problem to me.,NOT
wow thats a big baby love it!,NOT
there are many wayst o solve this wage gap problem i personally don't see it as a problem so long as earnings per hour is the same) these mannerisms are all purely social and it boils down to undemonizing men and fathers as incompitent holliwood loves to show the mother as the does everything and the men as unparenting' and if they are a good parent they are a divorced b mother died or c learning the mother is always more compitent in shows and movies in parenting this provides a social stigma that if there is a child in the family the man isn't the main influence it's the woman this makes bosses in the business district highly uneasy with giving women promotions to jobs that require heavier hours or more rigorous work when they are pregnant as they will also have the burden of their children now another example is that in a core family ideal it is the man who does the work and the woman who stays home now when this ideal shifts it's interesting to see how people react if both parents are working they're both valued and putting money on the table if the father is working and the mother is not it's considered a normal basic family if the mother is working and the father is taking care of the house he is often considered a leech and a deadbeat thus the men in order to avoid social hatred from peers and so on always gets a job or at least most men will try to get a job a woman on the other hand doesn't always need a job to be considered acceptable or normal a very huge example of this is in the military there is a large amount of males in there in a stable secure and well paying job while a large amount of women associated with the army happen to just be house wives without much of a job stastically this forces the wage gap to be in men's favor since they are socially required to be employeed or they're considered practically on the same boat as criminals and meth heads finally this wage gap will probably never be fixed because of that earlier detail i mentioned the military is a dangerous job as well as lots of other jobs it's clear that men favor or do not mind dangerous jobs that could result in injury or death while women on the other hand do not favor those jobs dangerous jobs pay more.,NOT
beyond meat burgers are greasy and unhealthy i had one and it made me feel sick if we're replacing meat with something that's so highly processed and unhealthy we're not getting anywhere we need people to embrace a whole food plant based diet we need to make them feel better healthier happier beyond meat is just an opportunistic enterprise getting rich by riding the wave of this new trend they don't bring any value to the people i bet that in the future all this new type of junk food will be classified as unhealthy educate the people make them fell better and healthier and they will stop eating animals on their own accord i really hate these vegan movements trying to shame everyone who doesn't adhere to their principles we really don't need a new global national socialist party.,NOT

curious as to why this is such a huge issue you'd have to look very to find any two groups who earn the same amount asian men make more than white men white women earn more than black women what is being about these differences what about the gaps between us citizens and german citizens why is one earning less it seems like one group is wanting special treatment.,NOT

1 women are less willing to work overtime on call hours extremely valuable for nurses lawyers doctors etc.  men are willing to work alot more hours  women dominate fields that don't have a high salary potential psychology social work gender studies  if women really were getting paid 0.7 for every dollar... why wouldnt a company only hire women seems like that would be an easy way to cut labor costs by 1  gender wage gap is not result of sexism it is a result of personal choice,NOT

where i work at in my department we have seven men who are all doing the same job none of use are making the same wage some of us have more seniority than others some of use have more experience than others and some of us simply produce more money for the company than others factors such as this always effect how much a person is paid even if you are doing the exact same job and ladies i am going to tell you something and it will probably upset you so you might want to sit down it just might be possible that guy at work that is making more money than you is simply better than you at that job gasp!!!!!,NOT
looks like i have to deal with this untrue misleading garbage just to watch the interesting stuff you post.,NOT
beware of pasta like when i first went vegan i ate so much pasta because it's easy to make and fast but i gained so much weight i recommend buying lentels frozen peas beans invest in a pressure pot and cook lentels and beans in it it takes  min to cook instead of  min in a regular pot u can make majadra pea soup lentel patties my favorite is sweet potato soup also u can make a substitud for cream cheese with tofu check on youtube fast and easy vegan recpies there's a ton honestly there so much to make and it can be very cheap,NOT
so it's incredible retarded that this philosopher who works in a shitty university comments on a topic that she clearly knows little about as an economist let me comment on a few things  yes businessman are making a monetary loss whenever they do not hire a women with lower wages since they could potentially lower their labor costs however as gary becker pointed out long ago a right-wing economist who is a nobel prize winner if employers have both some monopoly power and distate women they can get away with discriminating women given that the forces of competetion won't work properly . the same basic result applies whenever the reality deviates from perfect competition for example whenever there are search frictions in the labor market or in other words when you have to actually spend time searching for a job which is the case in real economies)  different career paths may not be choices or voluntary whenever there are gender restrictions on in certain occupations as there are in many places in the develiping world) whenever an occupation is overly seggregated or whenever discrimination caused an unequal distribution of math test scores for example women cannot really choose to be an engineer if they face a gender gap in math to begin with...  of course women work less hours and thus are promoted less ever heard of the glass ceiling? as men why because domestic work is unequally distributed and women bear the whole burden of domestic work in most countries of the world if we had some policies to socialize care work as there are already in place in many developed countries then the gap in market hours between men and women would diminish substantially all of this is not either common sense nor a leftist conspirancy it's just good science.,NOT
they think it's an advantage it is an advantage they are dudes!!!,ABU
they left out the part about men being forced to do all the dirty/dangerous jobs in society and how those jobs pay a premium for the danger that also plays a role in the wage gap when are we going to try to close the death on the job gap over 3 of the people who die on the job are men is that less important than women making less money than men even though in reality women control 0 of the total purchasing power in america.,NOT
yaaas girl you can do this honestly the more research you do about the animals the more you'll be convinced to stay on this lifestyle.,NOT
just goes to show you that if feminists had their way women would be getting paid more money for less work than men.,NOT
hmm what's stopping them from not taking hormones before meets they still have an advantage crazy.,NOT
so you have to somehow make companies and corporations to change their work ethic for women to shrink the pay gap the median shows that there are less woman making high wages compared to men and vox even admits that having kids greatly effects it having kids is a choice isn't it?needing flexible hours to accommodate taking care of your kid was a thing that happened to choice why must we actively try to change the wage gap if it doesn't even determine how successful a woman can be a solution could be to have more woman that don't have kids and dedicate lots of their time to work the wage gap is essentially not even oppressive but rather showing of how family systems tend to work it all comes down to whether or not you will settle down for a family or continuously put your knife to the grindstone.,NOT
interesting that the people in dis documentary who claimed meat consumption was healthy looked particularly unhealthy and were mostly obese...,NOT
first of all gay people or binary whatever the hell you people want to call yourselves y'all aren't the only ones in the world with the right to free speech so you can get down off your high horses you don't want anyone judging you yet you judge everyone else just a bunch of spineless pussies.,ABU

trish this is great news going vegan can be really hard at first so don't beat yourself up and give up on veganism if you make mistakes i made mistakes when i first went vegan such as accidentally eating parmesan cheese on my spaghetti at a restaurant and eating sour cream that was mixed in with guacamole it's okay just pick yourself and carry on what matters is that you're trying don't just eat fruits and vegetables though i recommend morning star garlic and quinoa vegan burgers on a bun with lettuce tomato onion ketchup and sour cream get some cans of chick peas they are delicious and hummus and pita bread it's so good you can make a great meal with hummus on bread with fresh veggies they also have vegan frozen pizzas that you can sprinkle vegan cheese shreds on it make smoothies in the mornings or have toast with vegan butter bagels with pb&j the options are endless please don't just eat fruits and veggies and starve yourself and give up on veganism good luck we support you!,NOT
this doesn't make any sense letting to grown men run against high school females that's fair our society is a joke and america needs to wake up,ABU
there is no wage gap pay is commensurate to the experience and ability of one to perform the tasks in a job this means if you put the exact same hours in the exact same amount of effort and professionalism into a job your paycheck will show it it has nothing to do with gender skin color sexual orientation or any other trivialities women have different priorities so their paychecks show it.,NOT

wait the graph at :1 is badly interpreted could be interpreted as more it contributes for the pay gap but it doesn't mean that an individual woman make less just about how many women to men work in that job it is important as these fields are the best paid fields so the less women in this field in average women make less.,NOT

i believe you may have misunderstood the argument the argument is not that there is a literal gap in which at the same job post women are paid less than men it is that systematically women are prevented or discouraged from obtaining higher paid work for a number of different reasons men are seen as more powerful wise and omniscient women are more likely to be the primary care-giver to their children women are more often than not disrespected in positions of authority because of man's insecurity etc.,NOT

i agree with you i'm a born female and i dont wear makeup or do my hair every day i'm literally sitting here in sweatpants a tshirt i bought from the men's section and ugg boots with my hair yanked up in a ponytail and no makeup so according to miss trisha over here i must be trans and a drag queen other people have told me i must be gender fluid or something because i like certain things and act certain ways so i must want to be a man which isn't true there is more to it than just how i dress myself or how i act.,NOT

what's the big deal just let her say or be whatever she wants dafuq you don't have to understand,NOT
people saying it doesn't exist are wrong it is definitely exaggerated though not to mention that all the statistics around this are outdated we should be looking at what women going in to the workforce right now can expect to make compared to their male peers in the same profession the fact that they were using people from different professions is ridiculous there are more women in universities today than men so it stands to reason eventually women will have a higher median income especially considering the lack of women in lower paying labor jobs but no-one will say it's sexist then.,NOT

trish you live in la there are plenty of vegan restaurants if you don't feel like cooking or just eating fruit all day,NOT

funny they never mentioned the gender rolls that affect those numbers men of course are more likely to take longer hours because men are by many studies secondary in child bearing so the fact that men are just more willing does not cover the whole story,NOT
they are not brave or female,ABU
women do not make less than men they work less that simple.,NOT
men work themselves until they're mentally and physically sick men will work at the expense of their relationships and family and friends men will earn money by dishonest or immoral practices but if we change the culture women can do this to i bet you can't wait to teach your daughter these things yay for equality😉,NOT

the fact that this was said by a women shows how fake the wage cap is lol,NOT
i don't understand why people want mothers to work and fathers to care for children there is a *reason* that these so-called gender roles have developed and it is the simple fact that men and women differ biologically women on average do a much better job with child rearing than men on the other hand men on average are willing to sacrifice almost everything for their families financial stability i've seen women throw it all away to be mothers and i've seen men throw themselves into work to support their families at the cost of rarely being with them the happiest families are those who find a happy medium but the woman should be the caregiver and the man the breadwinner that's just how it works.,NOT

vox if the real issue is women doing more housekeeping than men and so working and earning less it's not a wage gap it's a housekeeping gap and it's no place for government regulation.,NOT

great video the gender wage gap is real sexism is real racism is real but doing nothing but complaining won't make a difference women and men pick different jobs with a lot but not all women choosing to have kids or lower paying jobs in a variety of different fields for example a vet/obgyn/pediatrician/psychologist/psychiatrist will obviously make less then heart and brain surgeons why do women gravitate towards lower paying jobs it's their choice why do women have kids it's their choice so.......,NOT
if there's no wage gap then why does my girlfriend make more than me haha checkmate prager ),NOT
the argument that feminists are making is that they want equal pay so that means that in their eyes a female social worker should earn the same as a male eco consultant reminds me of something.....communism.,NOT

wage gap isnt real,NOT

yay excited to watch,NOT
good luck doll can't wait to see how this turns out for you cutting back a lot on alcohol or completely eliminating it from your diet would help immensely as well just a suggestion if you still need/want to drink do you but even if u only had one day a week that you allowed yourself to drink you would lose a good amount of wieght😆 also eat more throughout the day as that speeds up your metabolism whereas if u starve yourself or only eat once or twice a day your body stores fat cuz it doesn't know when u will feed it again good luck to you doll!! xo,NOT
i see a lot of people on this thread commenting about how the wage gap doesn't exist and that this is feminist propaganda but they fail to see that the extremist view of the feminist is that there is a wage gap out of malicious intent from males where in the real world the wage gap is a combination of unfortunate circumstances and averages between differing career choices while i believe we should challenge the extreme interpenetration of the wage gap i do believe it in fact exists and we should be doing more to understand it rather than shifting blame or denying it's existence.,NOT

they have literally zero links to sources which for a site that considers themselves a university is very suspect since a student handing in a paper w no way to reach sources would fail i wanted to see the articles myself but it seems as if the channel wants to hide these studies if someone could find these studies i may believe the video but since i haven't seen any links i can't trust this video,NOT

good for you! you will be glowing after two weeks vegetarian diet won't make u skinny because of dairy but a vegan diet will i love the morning star products especially the meatless barbeque and sausage you can make blt sanwiches with vegan mayo bread cheese and bacon try smoothies in the morning with low carb rice powder also stir fry with tofu or beans is great for simple meals try veg soup or chill in a crock pot as it is easy and yummy avocado is very filling but limit pasta and bread.,NOT
thank you pbn you helped me on my journey to vegan since end of 01 im late to the party but im feeling best ever lost weight and taken up running for the st time in my life at aged  d,NOT
here's a tip coming from a ftm trans man stop stereotyping men and women saying that even if you acted slightly more masculine that makes you trans or a man and the reason you like gay men is most probably a fetish cause i know a lot of cis women who find gay men attractive and it is normal to wonder what it would be like to be the other gender but because you question that doesn't mean you are trans so yeah stop before all the angry lgbt members come and attack you.,NOT
wage gap is a myth if men and women have the same job title the same duties or work load and work the same hour how could they get payed less it would be discrimination which is a very straight forward lawsuit which no employer would gamble if the pay gap was so distant why are they paying men more when they could save millions of dollars a year in big corporations and thousands in smaller business ,NOT
this is bullshit and unbelievably unfair.,ABU
thanks for channel avoidance heads-up the world is already confused enough.,NOT

"i think we can all agree that this is not as simple as companies don't pay women as much as men"" and i think we can all agree that if a company is intentionally discriminating against women something should be done about it but i think that is much more on an individual case-by-case basis who cares about making the average full time salaries closer to each other that statistic means nothing as this video shows...",NOT

this is unfair i have participated in provincial track and field meets and this is simply unacceptable firstly they started taking testosterone suppressors in th grade which means they had a male muscular and bone growth for 4 the majority of their lifes secondly the girl who came first in the state championship 0 m dash had a 2.6 s run which is easily to . sec over the average qualifyers for state male) this clearly demonstrates that if they were to participate in the male races they would not even come close to qualifying for state and on top of that taking the st and nd place.,ABU
well some women want to compare/compete against men so here you go becareful what you wish for.,NOT
something tells me if they both ran against other boys they would come in last place.,NOT
no shit they won they're men regardless of what they think they are which is fine but if they are taking part in physical challenges how you identify shouldn't matter one fucking bit it is irrelevant they are men they should be competing against men or we should make a special trans olympics if necessary.,ABU
trisha potato is a complete idiot.,ABU
so the gender wage gap has nothing to do with discrimination and everything to do with personal choices it cracked me up that at the end she suggested we need to change jobs that reward working long hours because women don't tend to choose to work long hours what we really need to do is accept that it's ok for men to earn more as long as it's simply a result of their decision to be more dedicated to their work.,NOT
karma will come for us one day we will all be eaten alive then how are u gonna feel,NOT
eat more vegetables cuz fruits have a lot of sugar;},NOT
it's not a wage gap it's an earnings gap,NOT
jason has left the chat,NOT
vegan mukbang plz trish,NOT
to sum it up video states that the wage gap isn't because of discrimination but because of what choices women have jobs worktime etc doesn't state that there is a pay gap i conclude that there isn't a discrimination of women but that the fault is in women as they can make more they just generally choose less paying jobs work less not everything is their fault as you can account that women have kids so that influences their earnings),NOT
wait.. years out of business school men have an average salary of 00.00 dollars average how is this real? please tell me it isn't,NOT
man earn more but women are responsible for 0%-80 of purchasing that means that man earn more but does not expend on his own what a patriarchy.,NOT
trisha paytas the trans queen lol maybe she's parodying how the lgbtqwert community has been behaving lately everyone wants to be classified adjacent to trans while identifying as queer non binary.,ABU

what did freelee say at :39,NOT
curious to know if the study showing the shrinking gender wage gap in older women took into account women who left the work force to raise their children and never made it back in.,NOT
so your admitting this is mostly based on choices not discrimination now if i wanted to look at this through the lense of victimhood i could say that men are forced by society to work rigid hours to provide for a family even though they may not want too.,NOT

my only problem is that you say you're trans for all the wrong reasons gender is not a choice i did not decide to be transgender but i am wanting short hair because it's easier to deal with does not make you trans having a fetish for gay men does not make you trans wearing sports bras does not make you trans having gender dysphoria however does make you trans feeling overwhelming discomfort and wrongness when people call you she or a girl does make you trans if you'd said something along those lines i feel like this whole thing would have gone very differently i want to support you i really really do but you're making it very difficult,NOT
"i'm just so freakin sick of people blaming their own poor choices on supposed influence"" grow a backbone think for yourself you know i mean if the media tells you to gouge out your own eye are you gonna do it you would think the answer would obviously be no but somewhere some idiot is googling the best way to gouge out your eye.👀☝😱",NOT
so why should we want to shrink it if it is caused by a choice in priorities why not just leave women free to make that choice so long as there aware the consequence will be lower average pay?,NOT
imagine out clowning pennywise lmao honestly trish i expected so much better from you you lose not only a subscriber but a genuine fan trans/gay/drag/etc isn't a choice it's something you're born as and find out later on in life the fact that you actually think that because you don't wear makeup you have a masculine personality you go after gay guys makes you a trans man is honestly so disrespectful please realize you need help and get it you're  years old so please act like it.,NOT

dislike because they did a great job dismantling the wage gap then said it still exists it is a minor difference that can be explained by mentality and willingness to negotiate pay not a gap perpetuated by woman-hating capitalists just a difference that occurs because of many factors factors almost entirely based on personal choice.,NOT

im so sick of hearing so much about the wage gap the only reason why there is a wage gap is because women are usually the ones that take care of the kids and then when the women go back to work when they are  they are starting a new job so they obviously dont get paid as much as the guy thats been working that same job for  years its not a wage gap its a gap between new workers and experienced workers my parents were both engineers working for the same company in the same job and my mom made less money than my dad purely because she was  years behind in experience.,NOT

the wage gap is a compilation of average earnings between men and women it is and has been illegal to pay women less for the same job for nearly half a century.,NOT
thank you so much for this.. she really confused me and made me question my own sexuality lol and sorry if this offends any other trans but you're the most good looking trans i think i've ever seen hearteyes,NOT
why are women so butthurt men are expected to pay for everything anyways🤷‍♂️,NOT
also this entire video is fucking stupid.,ABU
the thing i wanted to hear during this claim that it's not sexist but didn't) was why are the choices women make prefer) paid significantly less than the choices men make prefer) if someone answers that the fields men choose are more significant or important i'm going to throw something it appears that either society could care less about the caring for humanity fields or about paying higher wage for women dominated fields this is crucial but wasn't studied so the study is spurious.,NOT
i've watched these for the past three years i always learn about something i missed and am filled with hope by what i see every year theres been progress 02 will be a great year for veganism our world depends on it.,NOT

thanks for this didn't wanna give trish my view in case it was bs really hope she sticks at this it could change her forever 💓,NOT
promotion of processed foods in the name of veganism is unacceptable replacing meat with a processed burger that tastes like meat is not veganism what are we doing here supporting processed food industry i'm a vegan and i have friends who aren't vegan.but i respect them more than those who promote processed food the environmental cost of processed food is as bad as the cost of non-vegans food we are told to eat multinutritients to make up for the deficit of essential nutrients my friends on the other end do not promote supplements my non-vegan friends do all things good for the environment they are as concerned for our planet as me.they eat local produce vegetables fruits meats) i'm subtlely doing my bit to change them to veganism but even if i don't succeed i will still have them as my friends at least they are not cheating people in the name of their eating habits unlike how our vegan community is misled and cheated it heartbreaking to see that vegans are misled into promoting processed and packaged food.,NOT
huge difference between plant based and vegan you can be vegan and not be plant based i can't eat beyond meat bc it's so processed it makes me sick.,NOT

"coming from a libtard here as i know republicans call us good video wage gap is almost 00 a myth i would have liked to see an example of a specific job that a man and a woman share and their wages to solidify the argument but i'll just assume that that's where the .6 comes from i do have an issue with the tone of the video though i get that prageru's audience is more republican and conservative but the aggressive tone and use of words/phrases like myth and sexists don't have their math right are just unnecessary rude and alienate half of your potential audience the people who you might want to convince that they don't have their facts exactly right the numbers don't lie in this case economics is clearly more complicated than businesses pay them less because they're women, but an aggressive tone does more harm than good.",NOT
people think i'm weird for hanging out with guys.. no sis that ain't it,NOT
and apparently in the 900s when women did have lower pay than men women eventually took over those jobs,NOT

like trump said when women can do the same or a better job than men then they can get paid the same women should stick to what they can do like housework and providing the males with offspring and making sandwhiches.,ABU
just because trisha has a massive following doesn't make anything she says about herself is invalid or done as some form of stunt for clout” if she had only followers she would be treated like any other transgender because there's alot that goes into an identity and just because one person has a completely different trans experience than you doesn't make your trans-ness invalid a community is open to all. not for those who fit within this specific frame or category of what they think transgenders should be. if she identifies as a male then she identifies as male you can say your opinions to her but to now call her out of her name even after she told you her truth is so messed up and ignorant.,NOT

holy shit haha i'm so happy to finally hear this! haha okay so you are definitely off to a good start with the fruits and veg i would recommend looking up raw vegan not gross for meal ideas some of her recipes are raw some aren't but they are all vegan definetly try eating more whole foods like beans rice lentils fruits and veggies the cleaner the better smoothies are great for breakfast there are loads of good green smoothies and some super tasty fruit smoothies there's loads of amazing junky food too like cashew milk ice cream mock meats cheesecake pizza etc but try to keep those to a minimum if you're worried about weight and skin i'm a vegan who eats junk food all the time haha so my skin still breaks out maybe look into lush's dark angel facial cleanser and tea tree toner to help with that i've heard a lot of good things about that stuff anyway good luck with veganism and holy shit i really hope it sticks!!,NOT

how many vegan women on this channel want to have sex with a real man instead of a soy boy vegan boy?,NOT
there is a study in germany that says that woman earn  les with the same backround,NOT
it's simple the wage gap doesn't exist why because if it did then companies left and right would be hiring females exclusively to save 1 of money from paying their worker's income meaning that rather paying a good number of their male workers 1 they'd have to pay their all-female workers .79 saving that extra .21 it doesn't take extensive research nor rocket science to debunk the wage gap myth however the point about women being also busy at home and how it relates to their wage is also a good example of why women also earn less in jobs than men great video!,NOT

"i like some of prager u's videos but the hypocrisy in this one really bothered me to me it clearly demarcates the true bias that our short-sighted society has against women and true femininity....and it's not the kind of bias that feminists propound we still live in a man's world, remember that song? where women's skills and interests which tend to be verbal and nurturing rather than the stem fields and women's call to be homemakers and to care for children and family members just aren't valued economically it really is unfair many women and yes many men too spend countless hours giving unpaid care to children the handicapped sick and elderly our society expects this more and more doctors are releasing patients who need 4/ nursing and can even prosecute someone who does not care for a family member but then we hypocritically turn around and blame women's choices because they're not as single-minded about a career as men do you realize how much our society depends on unpaid people many of them women to check on the elderly in nursing homes to take care of sick people to call insurance companies and wrangle with doctor's offices to care for autistic kids and small children our society could not afford to pay people to do what lots of moms do every day but this work has to be done and you can't trust that a hireling will always really give your loved one individualized care which is critically important for babies and young children. what this video also shows it that in order to make a man's wages a woman has to somehow truly transgender herself she has to somehow be able to change her brain which is different from a man's and be able to think and act like a man and have the single-minded career-drive of a man or be penalized economically this really puts women in an emotionally painful position and when i was a manager i saw women crying about this) either abandon their children in daycare all the time or simply not have children at all then where would our society be in  or  years i realize that part of the problem is due to the work of extreme feminism. our society no longer supports the traditional view of the family with husband who has the masculine drive and time to specialize in a career as prime provider with a family wage. the change in our economy so that women are now almost forced to work in order for a family to be middle-class is probably the worst thing to ever happen to women honestly although i certainly think that women should have the right and option to choose a career i myself have a master's degree. i'm an extreme conservative and i understand economics one of the areas in which i disagree with conservatism however is when conservatives hide behind the glib statement that people always have a choice. yes we all do have certain choices but we do not have a choice as to our sex as well as our race our intelligence level our physical handicaps and how we are programmed biologically oftentimes the dogma of choice is just used by the intelligent the wealthy the lucky the healthy and the otherwise successful to justify why they should be rewarded more $$$ in our society than others who perhaps work just as hard but in jobs or unpaid positions that our society considers to be menial or unworthy of remuneration.",NOT

if your going to be a raw vegan ya go ahead small in all the calories you can but if your eating bowls of rice all day it's not going to help you loose weight fruits and veggies are low in calories and you can eat as much as you want of them until you get full but anything else you should have in moderation i would try some vegan places out so it spieces things up and you can get some ideas of what you can make for yourself.,NOT
i watched trishes video and literally waited for this video to be uploaded lol,NOT
gigi being a total sweetheart though,NOT
go slow dont beat yourself up over mistakes read labels there are a lot of different options for replacements of meat some vegan brands taste a lotbetter than others look up recipes and try them you dont have to eat raw to be vegan do whats right and easy for you its hard at first but it gets a lot easier as time goes on good luck!,NOT

i'm a bit pessimistic about people for me the main reason was enough to quit meat but for the majority more still aren't.,NOT
it's kind of funny how people are entirely missing the point of this video men are not doing their fair share of unpaid labor child raising tasks and chores) resulting in women being forced to take jobs that dont have strict schedules while encouraging women to go into higher paying fields that dont have strict schedules is a bandaid to a chunk if the gender gap ignoring sexual harassment in male dominated fields like tech but that is a whole different issue) that still doesnt get arround the fact that women are doing more than their fair share of paid and unpaid labor so we need a cultural shift toward men who actually act like parents.,NOT
you're a idiot,ABU
this made me kinda sad for someone who writes songs about being a bigger size woman it's showing that you're not happy with your body you doing this is showing other people that being thick is not ok and having a body like freelee is what's beautiful guess my body's shit.,NOT
just goes to show that being trans for some is a fad it's popular,NOT

you never take into account what directs the choice of the people women are not sent signals that they can be engineers explorers or have an open world of careers for them i am not trying to sound like some liberal hippy but the it is evident that exposure to certain elements will influence your thought process from a young age women are given easy-bake ovens and fashion barbies while men are given tool sets and cars while yes you are the one who chooses your career but you are not in control of what products are placed in front of you your whole like that direct you towards who you become therefore there is still oppression with these gender roles also i am sure there is a misconception about females making 0.7 to every 1.0 and this video does a good job on clearing up some of the math) unfortunately i don't know that much about that topic so i won't put in my 0.3 cents on where i stand on it maybe that joke was a bit tasteless.),NOT

found this bullshit well eating steak gonna need way more steak,ABU
it is completely unfair!,ABU
the wage gap goes a bit deeper than personal choices society has stemmed from patriarchal norms and in turn women are expected to work these jobs although this may seem like a choice from the women their choice is influenced by history and present day society yes these norms will be hard to change and nobody should expect them to change in any short period of time but opening up more choices for women and trying to learn from history so it is not repeated is a good way to get the ball rolling.,NOT
also if u crave junk food tons of junk food is vegan not good for you but vegan lol them salt and vinegar chips u love oreos twizzlers dairy free ben and jerry's takis many cereals monsters spicy sweet chili doritos popcorn and the list goes on forever just google it  love you!!,NOT

"if you look at the richest people in the world there are all men why because they are actually doing stuff to make money they aren't trying to euthanize all guys because apparently if only women were on earth everything would be equal/utopian the truth is backed up by many biologists women tend to want to take care of the children,and they tend to want more time off because a guy works harder then a women does not mean he earns more than women stop taking bullshit theories about how you guys think the world should be and stop making minute long explanations about them that tell you nothing other than there were studies done to show x,y and z"" truth is researchers often cut corners when they need to get work done so they didn't take the time to pull out all the data necessary to tell you the truth they made an average salary means that more men went into those jobs out of the gate for reasons only those business men and women know about simple fact is the wage gap is bullshit because its a cherry picked problem made up by leftists to try to make the world better when its not possible to make it better than it already is in america side note if a women thinks she is getting paid less there are courts to sue the company for to get equal pay its not that employers are paying you less its that your paying yourself less women",NOT

oversimplified pharmacist is a bad example because they tend to all do the exact same thing so it's easy to justify earning what your peer's earn meanwhile a scientist or business person's position could take on a whole range of possible responsibilities and niches some with more earning potential than others so if the pharmacists wage gap is 2 then there's your argument proving there is a wage gap.,NOT

this video didn't really prove a point or make any points at all out of the men and women who took that business degree the men probably would have gone on to take jobs such as a stockbroker or a corporate investment banker while the women would have taken more casual jobs such as supply chain managers why because they choose to on average most women just aren't up to working the same hours as men wether or not they have kids to look after women also get sick more than men what most feminists don't know is that it is completely illegal for a boss to pay two workers differently for the same job but is it the same job at the mcdonalds i work at the male workers keep the shop running while the female workers mostly talk and take really lengthy bathroom breaks this video also didn't consider that even after the test subjects completed their business degrees not all of them would have gone on to work careers in business the video just said the income they are making why feminist news sources like buzzfeed and the abc keep making these type of videos is completely beyond me all the comments are negative.,NOT

i hate industrial farming it's pure horror but we are designed to eat meat but in a more humane way respectful and sustainable hunting being vegan wouldn't be possible without modern society such as b1 supplements or a mass of different fruits and veg being imported around the world to countries where it is not native hugh carbon footprint being vegan is being promoted despite it's long term health issues because it is about control you can't survive being vegan unless you rely on the system you go off grid or be self sufficient you would die therefore is it not natural.,NOT
am i the only one who actually understand what trisha is saying here she said she is starting tomorrow like theres no discussion to be had doesn't matter if she had non-vegan pizza today she's starting tomorrow doesn't matter if this is infact three weeks old she's starting tomorrow the date it was recorded doesn't matter she said tomorrow which applies strictly to the date this video was uploaded.,NOT

freelee is a bitch she is a nasty person she puts down dead people.,ABU
she's probably eating a donut right now lol love you trish,NOT
cmon vox you're on the right track(ish but what a terrible summary basically wage gap isn't as black and white as people think it is it's more that society is still aimed at women being primary caregivers and men being breadwinners so the opportunities they have are different it's not a case of paying equal wage for same job/hours because that's not the issue the solution is to start having better procedures in place for maternity leave less discrimination against females around the age they have kids more men taking paternity leave etc you kinda touched on it a bit but i feel like you spent too much time going in-depth into the studies instead of talking about the theory of it which is a pretty big part of the research itself),NOT
i can see how in some cases its unfair and unreasonable for there to be a gap.. however there are other reasons for it reasons im not gonna write an essay for but lets say alimony that seemingly only men get stuck with or in a good majority where the man is the main bred winner and the wife is doing it as a way for a few extra or a way to get out of the house it can be similar to how a single mom gets special social treatment vs a single dad i.e the mom needs money to help get a car fixed the sympathy is real but when a single dad needs to get money for a car he tends to be left to his own devices but hey im a white male millennial and we are apparently the problem to some people so what do i know.,NOT
love watching shit like this twist sjw's into a twist.....,NOT
it makes me cry to it hurts so much so see an animal so harmless get abused and especially when u have animals u love very much imagine people doing that to ur own animals i have birds so it definitely is hard seeing chickens get thrown around like their nothing i live in hills so i see cows with there babies happy and living their life and it hurts to see them get hurt like that some humans just don't have a heart to care for things we should be thankful we have we don't deserve to have animals on this earth if we r going to treat them like shit.,NOT

remaining oblivious to facts and reason regarding the wage gap propaganda in the us is far too lucrative for the neofeminist movement to abandon without the ghost of patriarchy to chase there are few gendered causes to rally around and individuals within the movement are left only with introspection which almost never yields the results anticipated our society does indeed have issues that require addressing but as long as neofeminists continue to taint each with the attitude that men are the sole cause for these problems many people from both genders will be reticent to become allies for these causes neofeminism having equal opportunity yet demanding equality of outcome.,NOT

alright i completely support transgenders and feel they should be treated with whatever gender they identify with.. however they still have the unfair physical advantage that all guys have over girls and that's why it isn't fair for them to be competing against girls who literally don't stand a chance physically against them it's just unfair in my opinion,NOT

you guys should create a spin off specifically focused on animal rights news and the activism that's being done this is great but it makes people think all is great within the movement there is so much work that needs to be done we need to highlight activism and liberation attempts expose political ties and injustices within animal ag bring attention to animal rights documentaries and alc conferences around the world.,NOT

blair i just want to say a few things one i didn't know anything about you until i seen a video you did about yaniv when i seen that video i started watching a lot of your other videos you opened my eyes to transgenders and it is solely you why i am able to accept the transition and why transgenders do so at first i was afraid for my daughters using public bathrooms for fear of them seeing a man urinating in a urinal because of you i realized that would probably never happen and it alleviated my fear and it grew acceptance in my heart when you denounced yaniv which was my worst nightmare as a mother of three girls i instantly respected you for calling it out and how much you went out of your way and even put yourself in danger to hold yaniv accountable i fell in love with you because of that not love as in romantic but love as in the way i love my family and children i have agreed with you on every video you have done including this one i love candace owens and i agreed with both of you but i had to admit you held your own with her which is hard for a lot of people and you eloquently stood firm to your beliefs thank you for being you and explaining yourself and your thoughts the way you do in my eyes you have paved the way for people like me who don't quite understand the transgender transformations to understand and even able to lovingly accept everyone you are truly a lovely woman and keep shining your light and love to the world!,NOT
trisha you're seriously mixing up being trans and being uncomfortable about the societal standards of women you seriously need to see a therapist or a professional in this area because you're clearly very confused about your gender expression defining your gender you're not trans get some help.,NOT
imma need to spit some facts this hate for her is pathetic. y'all keep saying she keeps saying transgenders or whatever um i'm sorry but trans is trans trans people acknowledge that and wear it proudly so stfu cuz it's been a big ass fuckin shit storm for a while i don't care what anyone is or identifies as nor should it you don't be butthurt and try to use anything to go after someone a lot of trans people don't got tits or a dick and whatever else you ignorant ass people who feel they need to be a man a female she's admitting to something she's felt trish's body is hers tits ass or whatever go talk shit to a pre-op trans who is scared feel comfortable the way they are fucking idiots she just admitted she's been getting therapy for this too non-binary she said is a better term for herself so stfu lgbt+ the people bitchin need to take a seat under a seat criss cross apple sauce childish ass hypocrites y'all getting mad but get mad when someone misgenders you for looking like a dude but ur actually a chick or ur terms are he/they and the miss that hypocritical ass sons a bitches trish has therapy for it like chill tf out she did nun wrong but use a term that may not fit her in ur eyes that is i seen boys look like girls i seen girls look like boys they identify as what they were born still i think all the hate is stupid and ignorant for any lgbt especially trans feel entitled to hate i hope your surgeries get botched you don't want no one tearing you down don't do it either we don't understand you we may not understand her but she's conflicted and getting help wtf you doing salty bitches??💯  hope you get it all figured out trish❤,NOT

watching that trolling train wreck i decided too head to the nearest chick-fila and call it a day hooah!,ABU
rather than focusing on the wage gap we should encourage women to take choices that they want to teach them that just becuase they dont see loads of women in technology they cant be part of this in the end career choices change a lot.,NOT
no ur certainly wrong,NOT
if you have to pick between a male and a female with the same skills its better to pick the male because he wont have the possibility of having a payed month off because of being pregnant,ABU
what do you say to the real girls this makes me sick it is soo wrong,ABU
clearly a marketing stunt,NOT
i'm glad to see this but at the same time you're not going vegan you're going plant based going vegan implies that seeing and knowing what goes on in factory farms and fur farms has effected your morals entirely and that you have decided to stop supporting the evil veganism is not a diet it's a change of perspective it's not supporting animal torture for the sake of taste and luxury i hope your plant based diet does make you go vegan though we need more people with a conscience ),NOT
gender is not what you do or your fucking hobbies,ABU
i was so hoping youd make a video about this hell yes,NOT
this has absolutely nothing to do with someone being transphobic this is simply what's fair and what's not and these two athletes have a definite unfair advantage over the other girl athletes this is about what's right and what's wrong and this is wrong on all accounts i'm all for you being whoever you want to be and whoever you choose to identify as but if that choice puts you in an advantageous situation over another then that's when it's cheating...period.,NOT
i like this side of freelee,NOT
i mean.. she's not actually serious,NOT
"""factually correct not really",NOT
freelee said you will gain weight if you go vegan carb diet in the beginning but if you keep doing it you will find your ideal weight/body shape find delicious vegan food that has tons of good carbs and bit of protein and enjoy don't worry about putting on weight through eating good food that weight you will lose without you even trying.,NOT
please trisha please do not just eat fruit! do not listen to this vegan freelee pseudo science you should eat a normal vegan diet meaning anything you want i recommend eating vegan junk food to start off bc it is literally soooooo good and wayyyy healthier than animal product junk food there are so so many vegan options you can eat not just fruit and vegetables. please trish do not just start eating only fruit and do not eat how freelee eats it's been proven by science numerous times that if you eat more calories than you burn you will gain weight eat high carb plant foods rice lentils oats pasta etc til you are satiated not stuffed to the point of vomiting the way freelee eats works for her but it has been proven to not work for everyone some great vegan channels to watch are unnatural vegan the vegan cheetah his channel will be back up soon i hope the vegan lass high carb hannah sorry for the caps but i am so proud of you trish for doing this and i just dont want you to do some shit pseudo science restrictive fruit diet bc of freelee.,NOT

4:1 is what i scream at everyone,NOT
i want to become vegan but my mum does not want me to as it will make it harder for her to cook meals for me i even offered to cook my own food but she does not like it.,NOT
these athletes don't feel like girls boys they are girls/boys respectively.. having said that i believe that in the legal regards to the matter it will have to be investigated by a panel if drs psychiatrists physiologists athletic specialists.. to see if one's chromosomal gender does give one an advantage in athletics.. as a gay man and a human being i demand this be investigated thoroughly and fairly also the father sounds absolutely stupid his number one concern should be his child their safety and loving them their health and education not a sport...,ABU
you can get milk made out of plants i enjoy soy milk with cereal at panera you can get a strawberry banana smoothie if you substitute the you hurt with almond milk you just have to ask them! nuts are really good for omega and other vitamins and proteins there are these vegan chicken patties and they are so good! go to whole foods they have a lot of healthy vegan foods but also have vegan brownies so stay away from those if you want to lose weight... if you're planning on going vegan for a while you need to do it to save the animals not just to lose weight i tried vegetarian to lose weight and i couldn't do it because i wasn't doing it for the right reasons! you need to do it for the animals that's how all the committed vegans are doing it,NOT

when the one athlete's like if they're happy that should make me happy' but that's really not how it works in sports like oh yeah if the other team is happy about our pitcher being down i should be happy too ,NOT
what an excellent video bravo!,NOT
in essence blames childrearing with the assessment that women do most of the work there with men slacking doesn't sound like news to me also doesn't sound correct sounds more like a basic explanation that appeals to those who believe in traditional male and female roles based upon a male dominated society where women are tasked with taking care of the kids.,NOT
i love the vegan movies thank you xx,NOT
and gay men don't get fucking sex changes so here is a lesson trish gay men date gay men they keep their parts and stay as male lesbians are women who date women drag queens are men who dress up in women's clothing transvestites are men who like wearing womens clothing with no goal to become a woman transgender male to female and female to male we are individuals who have body dysphoria our bodies don't match our brain state we hate having the parts we were born with and fight to become the the gender which will align with ur mind heart and soul we are the ones who get sex changes bisexuals are men or women who will date both sexes hope this helped we don't do it for attention we don't do it to get onto tv or put in magazines and we certainly don't use it to get views.,NOT
its exactly as she says about how being able to define the gender wage gap is hard to summerise when there are so many contributing factors to these causes of a wage gap other studies show evidence of the gap because of the areas they research the cause of the gap while other studies conclude that there is no gap because of where they focus their research and evidence on its very hard to come to a decision or view point when there are so many contradicting factors to consider.,NOT
this video was filmed around june 1 is she joking by proclaiming veganism or even vegetarianism yes but i think it's based on ignorance a lot of people who become vegetarian or stick with the vegan lifestyle are cutting out meat or animal byproducts because of vicious deaths of living animals cutting out meat and/or animal byproducts can also be very good for the human body if you're maintaining a healthy and balanced meal with other nutrients but by becoming vegan/vegetarian it really begins with educating yourself on how to do so.,NOT
absolutely zero talk of hours worked and life choices.,NOT
racism!! sexism!!! transphobia!!! we need democratic socialism to solve this!!!!!,NOT
if you can prove that women are underpaid even though they have same job same task same employer same hours same years of experiences same efficiency same company and the same productions then i will believe in wage gap,NOT

"don't be afraid of carbs potatoes rice pasta don't forget the veggies dark colors are the best dark greens and oranges like broccoli carrots collard greens gardein makes the best veggie meats"" count your calories boo!!!",NOT
everybody knows this unfair to normal young women these girls are competing with two boys why don't you have transgenders people competing with each other this is crazy you are making it a disadvantage for the girls who are physically females i can understand why young girls and women are having a major problem physically competing with boys and men.,NOT
i fully agree with all of this factors involved however don't seem to phase the people who believe in this fallacy freedom of speech is definitely at play and all are welcome to their freedom in that right i would add though that freedom of speech in expressing each opposing idea does not equate to realistic pragmatic fact opinion does not equate to fact appreciate the video keep up the great work!,NOT
all of the people that scream if they say they're trans believe them!!! are the same people saying fuck you trish you're not trans! in her comments lmao,NOT

shouldn't it be a  cent gap shrinking to a . cent gap you go from showing the alleged percentege of a womans earnings(77 or  cents to the dollar to the actual gap between men an women its just a confusing way to use the graphics it should be  cents shrinking to .6 or a  growing to a 3.4.,NOT
as a vegan i like to eat fruit in the morning with cereal and i also eat fruit as a snack in the afternoon for lunch and dinner i like to have veggiess and starches and occasionally ill eat tofu or beans for protein you should try vegan curry with tofu broccoli carrots green beans and potatoes served over rice it's one of my favorites.,NOT
the proof is in the pudding two boys pretending to be girls are winning place in all the races do we really need any more common sense to point out that they're winning because they're boys competing against girls do we really?!,ABU

hi i just ran into your channel and wanted to say my opinion do i think trish is transgender no now if she was doing to progesterone shots and doing surgeries then i'd say yeah but just because you're attracted to gay men it doesn't make you transgender i think she need serious professional help i love trish but jeez she's a mess.,NOT

if your trying to loose weight being vegan is not going to help going to the gym hours per week that's is loosing weight vegan is not going to help you at all sorry that's is from experience i tried vegan when i was  and it did not help at all you will feel drained inside so i decided to go to the gym houra a week going on a year now and i lost  pounds now i'm 1 and i feel great,NOT

i'm so proud of you! that's amazing that you are open minded and trying this eat lots of carbs and listen to your body if your body says you are hungry go eat: don't restrict your calories you can eat as much as you want i have lost lots of weight and have such clear skin since going vegan it's amazing my go to snack is hummus and broccoli: mmmmm also eat as much fruit and veggies as you want girl i eat  bananas a day a bag of cherries a bag of carrots and lots of other veggies in one day!,NOT

i just can't follow i'm just confused i love trisha and i just hope she can figure her brain out.,NOT
who ever dislikes this video has  iq,NOT
trisha you can still overeat on a high carb diet don't forget that watch what  days of eating all the fruit i wanted did to me and some other videos on that topic i wouldn't want you to eat too much calories end up not loosing weight or even gaining it and then end up blaming it on veganism and saying veganism didn't work out for you freelee that vegan couple and most high carbers work out they have very active lifestyles so they can afford to eat that many calories truth is that you can and probably will lose weight coming from a standard american diet to veganism but unlimited calories is an unrealistic expectation don't take this the wrong way this is just a friendly advice coming from a fellow vegan good luck on your vegan journey!,NOT
im not vegan but this is amazing,NOT
if the wage gap was true why are so many men wanting to be transgender women ma'am!!!,NOT

and just like that... the pendulum swings facts are in again.,NOT
wait i don't wear make up everyday and i don't do my hair am i a man now 🤣,NOT
i think the root of the problem is not the pay gap but the pressures and norms of women to be in the types of jobs that pay less and men in the types of jobs that pay more so there is an inequality but the root problem is in how we raise kids and even subconsciously push them towards different careers society shouldn't discourage men and women from jobs just because it's not normal for their gender.,NOT
i had to skip the greta part she is just being a pawn for adults and is just cringe,NOT
nobody trish i'm a gay man,NOT

to all the people saying that hormone therapy will make this fair why is it never girl to boy transgenders winning in sports they take testosterone why is it only boy to girl transgenders winning stuff why is there no girl to boy transgenders playing in the nhl or nba well i can answer that for you because hormones and if not) male bone density muscle mass larger frame more physical force and stamina there are also factors in our brain-wiring such as men are more risk taking and agressive which would give them an edge if you insist that men compete against women in sports you are actively for eliminating women's sports that's just what it is either you feel sympathy for men who think they are women or you are for obliterating female sports that's your choice.,NOT

shame arny handed out dead birds on thanksgiving 😭😭,NOT
serious question if gender is a social construct then can't she say she is transgender wouldn't we have to believer her because gender can be anything if she were to say she is transsexual then i understand that she is crazy and trolling my understanding is that transgender is when someone identifies as the opposite sex and maybe dresses or acts as such but transsexual is when someone identifies as the opposite sex and takes steps to medically transition just trying to learn thanks  edit so is transgender even a thing then if you are just changing behavior/clothing/style/personality that doesn't have to be a change from one gender to another if it were a change from one gender to another doesn't that just prove that masculinity and femininity are linked to sex idk this entire community is confusing to me i appreciate all insight,NOT

blair.. booger lol.,NOT
could you do more political stuff instead of trans stuff!,NOT
raw food is not the secret.,NOT
so exciting in tears.. of joy! ️💜🕊️,NOT
one of the most ignorant videos i've come across this argument is incomplete and the explanation is fragmented.. this video tries to propagate the lie that gender wage gap is due to individual choice let's take responsibility for the sexism that discourages occupational mobility do women choose to have lower paying jobs recognize that opportunities for men and women are not equal which is reflected in the wage gap women are limited in the kind of jobs they can access because of access barriers in both education and employment tests are designed to be more difficult for women than men attitudinal barriers about gender roles prevent job mobility this video conveniently doesn't address systemic problems of oppression that affect the opportunities available to women.,NOT
dear trish kindness is not a sign of weakness but a manifestation of strength and resolution your mercy for others means everything 3,NOT
omgggg im so happy for u! this is such a good start,NOT
good luck beautiful,NOT
so basically this says the problem revolves around taking care of children which women are biologically wired to be more inclined to do therefore they're trading their job and thus their pay for their children a choice they decided to make if you work less you should get paid less so employers aren't to blame if taking care of her children makes a woman happier then she should take care of her children in the end the wage gap is caused by biological processes that aren't inherently good or bad which we can't control this means that the wage gap exists but isn't a problem.,NOT
i love how thousand people still disagree with the actual facts and statistics presented to them,NOT
it's rediculouse this is how they become famous and rich how does anyone think they don't have an advantage....it's a joke they should compete with eachother...there a whole other race of people.they are baphomets!!!,ABU
am i a potatoe yes 0 am i also a jackfruit yes 00%,NOT
trisha fruit is awesome but please dont forget that you can eat potatoes pasta and bread there so much more than fruit that will really satisfy you please educate yourself on vegnaism because it seems as though you haven't fully researched the vegan diet and lifestyle!,NOT
i've tried beyond meat before its pretty good though i wouldn't eat all the time mainly cause i dont like the taste of beef the after taste of beef puts me off i also dont like the taste of dairy makes me want barf and the smell of it i had no problem giving them up and it was easy since i never liked them in the first place lol,NOT
well. that turned pretty quick as soon as a few astute folks did some  minute research into the 7 cents on the dollar argument and found it to be a fallacy in correlation it's now flipped to women make choices to work lower paying jobs in general than men. because society pressures them to do so. well from what i've seen the last ten years there are so many entities from advocacy organizations to notable individuals encouraging women to pursue higher paying jobs and work more like men do that even that argument is becoming ridiculous how about we allow folks to do what they want see them as individuals instead of lumping them into interest groups and see if our society starts acting rationally for once...,NOT
i think in order to fix the wage gap people need to forget what they know about the wage gap there are more factors that go into it than we initially think or see it's complicated just like any other issue...,NOT
freelee you should react to pewdiepie's latest videos it about vegans!,NOT
brilliant as always based mom.,NOT
you honestly deserve million subscribers you are such a sweet person and your absolutely perfect ignore the haters your freaking gorgeous and don't let anyone say your not i'm not vegan but i want to be i'm vegetarian i love you banana queen 💕💕💕💕💕💕,NOT
"""i'm going vegan has sheep skin lying across the couch",NOT
finally the truth about the perceived wage gap.,NOT
hold the phone imma blow your mind if there was no wage gap does this mean women are now being paid more than men?,NOT
being a carnivore or vegan there is nothing we can do global warming is already here shutting down the meat industry isn't gonna help as long as we cut trees build more factories and used plastic nothing's gonna change remember the dairy and agricultural industry cutting down thousand of trees every day.,NOT
wow wow wow.. so blessed to be vegan 😇,NOT
how does one go from a lesbian to a trans gay male tf.....,NOT
just because you're female it doesnt mean you need to embody femininity ive been a 'tom boy' all my life doesnt mean im trans.,NOT
well didn't really work out did it showing those chicken fingers the other day when you've been with sean.,NOT
isn't there testosterone level testing that even the olympics do...whats next they join the army to get everything free paid by taxpayers hell da no,NOT
women get paid less then men so why dont employers only employ women and save money or does it come down to skillsets?,NOT
im not quite sure if is good the production and market of vegan products in big restaurants.. i think that one of the biggest problems to our enviroment is the comsumption so how can help buying a vegan hamburguer or pizza in those places espero me haya explicado bien.,NOT
also fun fact the wage gap is a lie men often take more high paying jobs since we look more towards science and mecanica but women look more to serving and receptions just to call a few examples,NOT
if men doing most of the better jobs is why women earn less isn't that still kind of sexism?,NOT
good job vox!,NOT
im so proud of you trish i tried the vegan thing once and i lost like pounds in a week without working out its so hard to stick to the diet but its definitely worth it!!,NOT

thank the lord you understand that wage gap doens't exist,NOT
i think trisha might truly need to take a look at her mental health.,ABU
this is my opinion if you want the wage gap to disappear then work harder for it work for longer take more shifts men on average work harder and longer for more times during the week that's why men gain more money thank you for not freaking out about it like it ruined your life and instead kept your cool.,NOT
it's a career and schedule gap most men i know have there hour shifts let's say - but usually leave closer to about  plus as a business owner would you really want to invest more in a man who can do good work well into his 0s and 0s or invest in a women who is required to have at least months maternity leave whenever she has a kid which means you gotta pay to fill her position either overtime or a temp who's hourly wage is higher than everyone elses what if she decided to have a kid every year you'll get sued for trying to fire her plus at their 0s and 0s women go through menopause which studies done by women asking other women have shown that menopause reduces their productivity in the work place if you hire a  year old man for  years you get  good years of work if you hire a  year old woman for  years assuming she has kids you get  / years of work plus you get  months to years of sub par menopause work hiring women is bad business.,ABU

are you okay??,NOT
size  shoe vs size .. you do the math who's faster?,NOT
i'm a long-time advocate of whole plant-based diet and i'm very supportive of anything that gets large portions of the population to make the switch away from animal products however the attitude toward food and diet and what we associate it with needs to change as well food and diet should be viewed primarily as a component of health and hygiene instead we are all too often associating food with pleasure celebration and entertainment....which also includes all vices such as alcohol tobacco illegal drugs gambling pornography casual sexual encounters and many other hedonistic obsessions that are all harmful to health in the long-run people eating some of these new plant-based substitutes for burgers sausages and other animal foods are holding on to their traditional sources of pleasure i also agree that we need to eliminate animal farming for various reasons including environmental protection but again it is folly to believe this will solve the problems we face with pollution and climate warming the only solution that will ever have a chance of saving us from ourselves if it isn't already too late is to dramatically downsize human impact on the planet and that can only happen by an equally dramatic downsizing of the global population unless that happens and happens consistently and fairly quickly we are toast....all the other efforts to reverse climate change will not be sufficient not even close.,NOT
yay!!! awesome...yes vlog the weeks it is such a great choice to go vegan!!!,NOT
its ok to eat animals.,NOT
i was actually going to go low carb lol for the new year but this plant base is speaking to me in a way i can't ignore i'm going to go in the plant base direction now and see how it feels and works maybe even in the hateful climate we're in today this could be the beginning of the era of enlightenment that's more prophetic than we realize.,NOT

so great to see how far we've come so proud of the whole community ),NOT
oh please world goverments internetional bodies like the un oecd world bank and imf and leading banks and financial institutions all confirm the wage gap is real economists who have spent their entire lives studying the way gap and know a hell alot more about it than a 'resident scholar' of a right-wing think tank and edgy teens who have never worked a day in their life another ignorant video even the first argument 'why don't firms only hire women?' is a fallacy that totally ignores logistics demographics and skill levels not to mention the oecd found even factoring in 'work choices hours leave etc' still leaves a nearly -10 wage gap and forget off-the-books gender discrimination opening your eyes to the obvious conservative agenda being forced here.,NOT

funny how all the liberal wage gap blaring feminists i know are baristas at starbucks or waitresses working towards a career as a low paying social worker where are all the female engineers and lawyers complaining that they don't make the money of their coworkers?,NOT
the wage gap is just the average meaning its a generalization of the who earns more money key word is earns) first of all women work more low paying jobs its not sexist if a women chose to be a nurse and not a engineer nothing is stopping them from choosing to be an engineer in fact they are helped into it by affirmative action if a woman does become an engineer and works less hours it isn't sexist if she is working in a lower paying field like mechanical not civil it is not sexist nothing is holding women back they just don't value money as much as most men they usually prefer a job with more stability rather than a private business if a man is a doctor and a woman is earning less as a nurse they made different life choices it isn't a super natural invisible entity called patriarchy its free choice,NOT
you know what would be nice a video about some form of equality that isn't about the us.,NOT
yeah yeah their personal career choices but what if some women are forced to make these choices women can't avoid having children can they and if women want to take care of their children then they'll probably need to take more time off work than men.,NOT

it's disgusting how movements are hijacked by those who want attention people who never felt anything wrong with their identity or what's between their legs feel a sense of validation and special treatment by their peers when they come out being trans is hard people look at you like you're a freak it's way harder to get a job and you're ostracised by your family in most cases i love and support anyone who legitimately feels they've been born in the wrong body it's an awful feeling but it's also just a medical disorder individuals who make their personality around their medical records are like mothers who think having children makes them interesting it's not that important it should be a minuscule aspect of who you are and the world does not need to know.,NOT

wow.. this is great my tip would be to eat as much as you want within a meal avoid snacking between meals) and don't be too fanatical about exactly what it is you're eating i.e how healthy it is as if you can find things you enjoy and also make you satiated the longer you're going to stick with it and actually become less obsessive about what you're missing out on also don't worry about what others think or say about your choices just know within yourself and be happy within yourself that you are doing this for the right purposes ),NOT

yes everything you said is completely true they high paying jobs are dominated by males and that is the point ask yourself why isn't that men are more like to choose to become an engineer then a women and as a women in engineering i will tell you that it is because from day one women face more challenges in the technical world then men do society systematically guides men to the fields of high paying jobs and women to the low paying jobs girls grow up being told to play with dolls and makeup while guys get building blocks and kinects i know there is way more to this then that basic example but you get the idea this systematic sexism is what the cents on a  movement is about.,NOT

convoluted logic untested then becomes fantasy and distortion you state that there is no gender wage gap and then state that the gap is small then you justify the wage gap we can argue about how small and justifiable the gap is but first we need to know how you can state something that just isn't true in the first place this is just the old evangelical trick of providing lie to people who don't want to be called liars.,NOT

"no you're wrong on that one there is not a compelling argument both sides,",NOT
so what you're saying is that women earn less because they have children which then restricts the hours they can work and reduces their relative levels of experience when compared with people who have worked full time for the most part the other gaps are likely due to the fact that men and women are different with men having more physical strength more body mass higher muscle body composition ratio being taller more likely to take risks slightly higher iq's family roles encouraging males to work harder to support the family while the woman is caring for the baby ect.. until you invent a way for children to be made without the need for a mother and for as long as you're not pumping little girls with relatively huge amounts of testosterone hgh and retraining them to not be risk adverse or perhaps giving little boys drugs to make them more compliant and drugs to stunt their growth reduce their testosterone drastically there will always be a wage gap.,NOT

in the same job if they do the same thing they are paid the same of course it wouldn't count on different jobs and a wage gap is how much they get on the same job in the same place earning gap is when you have less because you want more and you spend a lot compared to those who don't.,NOT

hey blaire i'm not a constant viewer of your channel but i saw some of your videos and find your opinions quite interesting i don't agree with all of them but hey that's the joy of conversations xd there's one thing in particular i always find puzzling when hearing people's opinion on the matter and that matter would be men and woman are biologically different especially when it comes to the male/female brain that is what i believe not based on studies but what i consider common sense each sex has it's own good and bad attributes in varying portions and there are people now opposing the idea that there are differences between the two sex however if there is no difference that would contradict a lot of the base argument for their topics if men and woman are the same why make a big deal out of the first female insert job here)' it was because before women where expected to have overcome bigger hardships that it seemed like a breakthrough to get into male dominant positions if there's no male and female characteristics why do you wish for a female president if there's no difference why is it about time you get one that whole idea is based on the expectation that a woman wouldn't be as cruel as a man and more levelheaded in stressful situations equipping her with positive female traits) this contradiction just seems quite obvious and blatntly ignored by those claiming absolute unity of man&woman i would like to hear your opinion on this and perhaps other commenters to get some ideas from different perspectives  btw i'm neither here or there on this matter i find labels nonsense don't care who you are anyone can do what they want as long as they put effort into it and as long as they don't harm someone else it's fine with me.,NOT

but what causes that small difference in pay we know it cannot be gender discrimination because we have the equal pay act which makes it illegal to be paid differently in identical circumstances so are the men being paid more because they have more education or job experience human capital) that was not talked about in this video.,NOT

clear concise and honest thank you.,NOT
they are still trying to push this false narrative it's been disproven and explained thousands of times by now how many more times are needed they are seriously starting to sounds like creationists or climate change deniers at this point refusing to accept any sort of evidence and studies.,NOT
i definitely don't think its fair if they feel like they are women thats great there is no problem there however men are built with stronger muscles leaving these women at an advantage.,NOT
to be fair trisha's making as much of an effort as the gamestop it's maam! person and numerous jurisdictions at the behest of trans activists have self identification as the only criteria trisha's probably trolling but it's only possible because politicians listened to activists not doctors and scientists ‍♂ this will all get weirder and more confusing as time goes on i expect.,NOT
"""the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women it does not take into account different job positions or education levels.""",NOT
i don't think women are complaining that the female regional manager for a medium-sized business is making less than the ceo of a major oil company i think they're complaining that the same female manager is making less than the male regional manager at the same company to do the same job also a chemical engineering degree is only high paying if you find a job so it's pretty telling that you chose list the ratio of those enrolled in the program rather than the ones actually employed in a related field.,NOT
so according to the comments we either live in a perfect society where every single person is hardwired to treat everyone in the exact same respectful way or we live in a society where we have a male dominant entity that hates women and makes employers pay women less nevermind facts and details nope facts don't matter one side must be the unquestionable truth and research doesn't matter unless it contains a catchphrase that vaguely backs the agenda i support.,NOT

what people miss about the gender wage gap the fact it doesn't exist women have better chances of getting higher paying jobs than men.,ABU
she's so creepy.....,NOT
i made the decision to go vegan/plant based in 020 it's sad how much social media and doctors can brain wash us as a fitness influencer you see videos of people eating salad or fruit and being told this is stunting your progress even popular diets take out fruits and high carb veggies... so sad.,NOT
americans always wants to find a stupid reason without evidence and more stupid people will support this reason will make more problem that problem now will continued on by stupid people so over all stupid men and women are the problem,NOT
you're gonna look and feel so good,NOT
trisha please shut the fuck up and just take your bpd medication x,ABU

does she mean gender fluid???,NOT

great video keep it up vox,NOT
so proud of you girl you don't have to be as skinny as freelee but if you did it right you will become the best version if yourself and you will feel freaking amazing!,NOT
also women look for men who make more than them a men doesn't care what a women does he just wants her to be pretty so there is an incentive for men to work harder in higher paying jobs.,NOT
to boil down this huge ass rant that is pretty damn foot in mouth gender fluid is what you are looking for not transgender g e n d e r f l u i d cutting your hair short and liking it isn't just for guys its girls aswell its hair you like not being hit on creepily?? yeah duh doesn't mean you gotta be a dude to feel like that don't dress up hair and make up still possible for women you aren't a drag queen when you glam up you are just a woman glaming up if you wanna dress masculine you can still do that and be female from what you've said all im hear is i want to look and dress the way i want without weird shit happening you aren't trans for feeling like that that's how everyone feels no matter where you sit on the gender spectrum i really wish you took a bit more time before rushing in and saying all this incorrect and hurtful things.,NOT
i came here because someone has a petition to have her looks and sounds like a her removed from yt because she is offensive whether i agree with her or not i defend her right to say what she wants without being censored don't like it change the channel and now i will go watch something else.,NOT
this is why we need to get rid of sexism what trisha is saying is literally just sexism with all the gender identities these days people are getting confused.,NOT
the u cut that hair hair part is kinda stereotypical tho lol,NOT
finally vox welcome to logic!,NOT
and that is a badass,NOT
did you notice that the reasons you mentioned for men receive more work longer hours willing to relocate available at any time are directly associated with sexism once women take more of the unpaid work as cleaning and child care they can't be working lower hours!!,NOT
you should make a new day 4 proper food combining on a raw vegan diet flat belly ,NOT
hey girl watch nina and randa's channel they're what i eat in a day might help you as well as the fitness couple that righr now i'm obssed with good luck with the vegan diet 😘💕,NOT
if these two cheats really want to show their female superiority they should compete in the men's track events or catching the javelin.,ABU
for making going vegan a bit easier just check out recipes from hot for food minimalist baker and mary's test kitchen their recipes will give you a shit ton of inspiration and just so yummy also since you live in america it will be so easy for you because their are a shit ton a restaurant and cafes that you can just eat at when u don't want to cook and their are so many mock meats and yoghurt and mock stuff that taste great if you ever crave anything you can just buy a great substitute or find in a vegan restaurant or just cook it you have so many options it should be pretty easy biggest tip you have to eat a bit more then usual because vegan food is less caloricly dense most of the time you don't even have to change ur diet if you don't want to its just the art of substitution if you had like a yoghurt for breakfast just eat a vegan one or a breakfast sandwich you can make a vegan one or most probably buy one ok hope this helps sorry that this so long ),NOT
i'm just gonna let this here and hopefully you will read this sorry if my english is bad obviously there is a lot of hate around you and your channel so i was really septic about you i didn't really know what to think but recently i have been watching my eating disorder story type of videos on youtube and i have noticed that most of the people who recovered were now vegan and a lot of them mentionned your name i just wanted to say that you really earned a lot of my respect as eating disorders are a really touchy topic for me you literally saved people's life and that is beautiful so yeah maybe you are called bitchy and stuff about your videos but let's not forget that you helped a lot of people ・ω・) love xo,NOT

good luck trisha ,NOT
hahahahahahahahaaaha you corrupt elephants know nothing,NOT
all aboard the hot mess express,NOT
well it is true women get paid the same but why is the unemployment line in my area 00 male and why is it that businesses are refusing to hire a male who meets the qualifications that the employer is asking for and instead hiring a female right out of high school who does not meet the requirements also why is it that the average female here has as many as jobs when the male can not even find one no matter how hard they look the answer because business are being required to hire a female over a male and oh yea lets not forget the homelessness ratio which happens to be yea you guessed it 00 male why because they can not get jobs.,NOT
you look so unhealthy,NOT
i'm gay for blaire,NOT

i'm pretty sure she's trying to say she gender fluid like some of y'all are being rude for why she may just not know and be mistaking it for being trans as that's the only way she feels she can describe it.,NOT
unsubscribed because of that video.,NOT
hi trisha i'm vegan and it seems everyone's recommending you the not so appetizing things to a meat eater like nuts legumes beans! which are totally great but if you're someone who likes more meaty and fattier things there's so many amazing brands that especially where you live you can get substitutes at your regular grocery store some great ones for meat are gardiene eves and if you love ice cream some are coconut bliss so nice etc you can eat most potato chips and the best vegan cheese is daiya i like the blocks the most) there's lots of butter replacements you can eat tons of dark chocolate etc etc(:,NOT
lol they don't even realise they're promoting the neo-capitalist society when they support more flexible hours more flexible hours will only lead to more insecure work contracts creating more inequality.,NOT
no boys dressed as girls,NOT
thank you thank you thank you!!!! i love you guys here's to another great year~,NOT
she thinks because she doesn't wear makeup or dress up everyday she's a man i literally would be a man as well if that was true.,NOT
oh come on!🤨since when does youtube not notify us of new videos if we don't follow you on all the socials i don't follow you there because i don't use social media i'm a bad millennial🤯lol yet i get notified every time i know i'm not the only one i'm just a more extreme case which actually supports what i'm saying even more so that doesn't seem completely honest.🤐🤷‍♀️,NOT
this is a good option for food refried beans rice mixed organic greens and vegan sour cream you can mix it with more refried beans to make a dip you can make a wrap out of it you can make a salid all you do is heat up the refried beans and rice for a minute in the microwave and mix as you like.,NOT
doesn't blocking testosterone eliminate that advantage that everyone is talking about testosterone is what makes your body grow and function like a typical mans body hair muscle growth all that is affected by testosterone if they no longer have testosterone and now estrogen what girls have the advantage really isn't that big.,NOT
yess trish im soooo happy for you!!!! youll feel so much better i promise and you can eat whatever you want especially in la all the vegan places there!! youll be happier and feel better!! i did really good in the beging eating completly clean but because i wasnt doing for asthetic reasons i started eating like taco bell and chipotle and stuff still vegan but i dont eat like that all the time!,NOT
question for most of your charts the y-axis is littered with .2s or 0.3s and i want to know what they mean.,NOT
yay trisha sending encouraging positive vibes!,NOT
i've never seen freelee this happy!!,NOT
"make the inside match the outside as many times as you said aesthetics"" i never heard workout""... come in do you really walk your talk i get so tired of all these barbie doll wanna bees but they all use plastic surgery anes makeup for the aesthetics you speak of good luck with staying vegan tho!",NOT
go watch monami frost she makes fun vegan food like sushi burritos and she eats so much too,NOT
this shit makes me sick,ABU
yeah right lol,NOT
it's illegal to pay someone less because of their gender since 963,NOT
you done lost your mind,NOT
i'm actually so proud of trisha,NOT
woman that want to be great business women and raise great kids realize they can only do one or the other so they work less hours simple as that oh and men choose more dangerous but higher paying jobs like construction plumbing risk of infection or ruining someone's property etc.,NOT
freelee i was once a hater but my ignorant ways are over i've been vegan for weeks now and i have never felt better i wanna say from the bottom of my heart thank you for showing me a good life style to live  go fruit yourself!,NOT
why aren't trans men breaking any records or at a minimum being competitive?,NOT
if you really cared about your sons future you would have raised them to be a men and lest anyone get's confused about what it means to be a man a man is defined by his character not his penis or lack there of and there are no compelling arguments on the side of the males racing against females just feelings that lack empathy for their opponents.,ABU
vegan life style safe the planet and yourself!! be kind and stay healthy,NOT
i'm not looking at your chest blair i know that your eyes are there and i'm looking you in the eyes honest.,NOT
what function do the gallbladder and bile production have for a vegan is it just sitting there doing nothing also the locally produced organic grass fed beef that i consume is soothing for the planet a vegan diet where i live destroys the eco-system.,NOT
trisha you look gorgeous💕,NOT
how about man take on the same number of household chores than woman that way they are both equally affected by non-flexible hours seems easier and more natural than forcing every job to a flexible schedule.,NOT
she's gunna see the weight fall off and she's gunna be hooked to the vegan life style....,NOT
trish is a troll however in the past years been through shit if she's having a mental breakdown i wish her the best.,NOT
aaaawwhhh look how happy freelee looks awh veganism really changes lives and i'm so thankful for freelee!,NOT
i think she wants to be a part of something to feel loved seems to be lost soul it's sad really i hope she finds the help she needs.,NOT
oh there's wage gap between me and rich-family-princess alright.,NOT
men are more likely to have a dependent spouse men are far harder hit by divorce than women women get far more government assistance than men men are more likely to be homeless than women as both the government and relatives are far more likely to help women in poverty tell me again about women's problems.,NOT
so the key to closing the wage gap is to make more flexible hours that would be great for everyone so you can plan your own schedule to fit your specific needs gotta get to the root of the problem rather than just seeing the surface.,NOT
incredible  proud to be a vegan.,NOT
look at her last video.,NOT
just subbed  vegan for life!,NOT
trisha is either so clueless it's pathetic or she is just cruel making a mockery of people.,ABU
vocal fry stop it.,NOT
um sis i love you and all but this don't make sense i'm confused like what? are you a boy or girl...i don't think you can be both and what is this saying about jason he isn't gay...right?,NOT
like i am trans and some transphobic person sent this to me and he ligit said this is why the transgender community is gross and its all just a faze so like wow.,NOT
i wish i could understand this i really do.,NOT
feminism is cancer the wage gap is a myth women if you don't raise our children our society ends and the muslims will force you stay home and be nothing more than baby machines western women you are the most privileged group in history stop indulging your every whim and consider the society that gave you so much again feminism is cancer.,ABU
so in summary for you lazy twats watching) the wage gap is formed by the hours and availability of the worker and this generally correlates with gender no feminist bollocks lovely.,NOT
i'm no vegan but im sure you can eat beans for protein,NOT
yall know trish is a troll right,NOT
you guys are bad and you should feel bad.,NOT
people miss the gender.,NOT

that's right all those male ceos who earn billions have done so on the backs of underpaid women who wiped their butts in pre k.,NOT
she'll blame this on drugs just like the whole chicken nugget thing,NOT
people saying a thousand percent as if they think it is more than a hundred percent stupid.,NOT
so what i understand is that men earn more money because they got better jobs my question is why is it not  males who get these jobs and 0 females?,NOT
also the fact that women give birth and want to raise their family means they have to sacrifice a high end job or full time hours in order to be with her family and raise them they can work part time maximum if they want to actually have time for their family life is all about making sacrifices if you are working in a high end job you often sacrifice your family time and free time if you are working a small part time job you are sacrificing your income in order to have more free time and family time women generally prefer doing the latter women who have children who are working full time or in high end jobs are constantly giving their children to nannies to look after they don't have proper time to spend with their own children and raise them it's unfair on the children.,NOT
old video didn't stick to your word shut up ms.piggy 🐖,ABU
lesson if you want to earn more money dont't have kids,NOT
every time you put out a video i lose my shit over how pretty you are,NOT
i have literally never clicked a video quicker you go trish! you can make this a whole lifestyle,NOT
needless to say that more flexible hours are awesome for everyone not just ppl with children.,NOT
they're being so fucking selfish its not even funny they have the bodies and all the advantages of being male even standing next to any of the girls you can see a very very clear difference to paraphrase they basically said if i were in there she's id be happy for me like i get you want to be supported but when dozens of girls have practiced their ass off to compete to have a pair of boys take first and second place.. that's bullshit pick up art or something that's not inherently easy for you don't fucking like these two at all...,ABU
i see that chik-fil-a cup ),NOT
she has a fking fetish for gay men and thats why she's becoming one trenderalert,NOT

ive been vegan for about to weeks and tbh its not that hard their are alternative for everythingggg the only thing is lately my bones have been feeling like weak so my aunt bought me some natural supplements for it other than that ive been fine (((:,NOT
this video misses the point ok men do work in jobs that pay more and sometimes this is due to danger or time worked but it doesn't explain why a skilled but feminised profession like nursing which is both skilled and difficult pays fast food wages looking at the caring professions in general even skilled and important ones such as day care social work and nursing) professions which women gravitate to and.... by coincidence they all pay low?? the argument that businesses would employ women if it were true?? wtf try and find  women oil rig workers.....or plumbers.....or engineers stooopid argument but industry happily does underpay in the professions that women prefer too complex to work out the reason nah!! in the past when women started working and moved into these fields men payed the wages and undervalued their work the present situation is a result of the past so we can say that the reason for this difference is complex which it probably is or acknowledge that it is unfair regardless of how complex the reason for the present factual situation is and rather than forcing women to move into jobs they might not care for pay them fairly where they predominantly can be found!! lastly i'm a guy....i don't believe in the premise that this is all down to toxic masculinity but i'm also not going to deny what is right in front of me my sister is skilled and works with brain damaged adults getting payed  dollars an hour.....i work as a night attendant at a university opening and closing doors requiring no skill or care)....i get  dollars.....happy i don't care.....and thus get payed a living wage!,NOT
my teacher decided to lie to my whole class and say that the gender wage gap is real now i'm changing schools because i have a bad teacher and need a better education that doesn't include all this drama on feminism and liberalism,NOT
things i noticed you have a vocal growl that presents at the end of some sentences in a single word or end of a word usually multi-syllabic words like instances grammar girl has one too for reference the word will drop in tone and be produced lower in the throat giving a little distortion to the word sounding like a growl lion tamer is now called lion trainer most crossword puzzle writers called constructors are men in prison with long sentences there are only about 0 that create all the puzzles books included you find my mother was an exception creating puzzles well into her 0's they become harder as the week progresses but not because the solutions are harder the clues become more obscure all crossword puzzles are diagonally symmetrical she was also a writer but changed her first name from julia to the initial j spelled jay because male writers were favored over female right out of the gate any major publisher can verify this she was also boston's first female insurance claims adjuster and fought the good fight to get that job many other male adjusters were livid they would even consider her she got her scuba certificate at  and pilot's license at  while raising two boys on her own sorry to ramble but this seems to me relevant to the topic she found ways around the income gap renting rooms in our house typing for students and going back to school to get her master's in expressive psychotherapy at 7 the more ways across the gap the harder it will be to keep that gap open keep trying be creative and stay positive.,NOT
yeeeeeeeeeees amazing work guys 🙂🙂👊🏽,NOT
almost everyone is being so mean in these comments and i don't get it i totally support you trish i would recommend you checking out mommytang and high carb hannah's videos as well because mommytang eats lots of greens and hannah eats tons of starches and they eat very simple i know you don't like lettuce so you could try putting a bunch of greens in a smoothie along with some bananas maybe to drown out the taste of the greens having or fruit monomeals is great too just don't starve yourself good luck:),NOT
ok so what i got from this is that she just wants a shorter haircut because she doesn't like brushing her hair.,NOT
i did the same thing you're doing about proclaiming it out loud i was stuck in a pescetarian phase for almost a year really struggling to make the commitment to veganism so at work i told everyone i was vegan from that day on and so i was it definitely helps to put it out into the world i lost  pounds in the first four months of going vegan and even though it wasn't my goal to lose weight during this process it is a super bonus the first two weeks is a bit of a struggle but after that as long as you eat well and nourish your body it'll be the best decision you've ever made the best advice i can give you is that if you mess up allow yourself to move on a lot of people feel like if they messed up once then it's hopeless and they want to stop being vegan you just have to accept the fact that it's an entirely new lifestyle you have to get used to and you will accidentally eat things that you wouldn't even think weren't vegan just take each moment as a learning experience and enjoy your journey!,NOT
trish i will go on vegan diet with you i am inspired ),NOT
so just curious why you gagged at most if not all of the vegan things you had on your taste test video funny how you want to go all vegan now,NOT

i don't know how someone who eats like 00 calories in a meal filled with meat and dairy etc can just switch to a vegan diet so drastically i'm not judging or saying she can't do it but from what i've seen her eat on a daily i feel like it's such a quick and drastic change anyways i'm not a nutritionist or anything that's just how i feel about it no negativity towards trish bc she obviously can do anything she wants to with her life as long as she's healthy and happy ,NOT
most of my crushes where women so does that mean i'm a straight guy by trisha's logic'?,NOT

fuck trolling trashy trisha i was a long time subscriber of hers and chose to look away when she'd past controversial troll videos over the years.. sometimes i even found humor in them however when she faked opiate withdrawal i pulled the plug on financing her hoarding lifestyle as someone who has struggled with opiate dependency due to chronic and deteriorating issues within my spine that was negatively impacted by this hocus pocus bullshit narrative spun by the government across media increasingly so over the past six to seven years in addition to losing several friends and family member because of overdoses because they were strong armed into illegally sourcing opiates which ended up being this imported chinese super fentanyl fancily made to appear like their normal medication that had previously helped them have any sort of quality of life but was ripped away from them because of a god damn government experiment ps earlier this year the opiate epidemic was found by the ciaag to be a government experiment much like the 0s crack issue if anyone would like i can provide a link to their findings which have sources linked to gov web addresses.,NOT

aaah yes we understand that the earnings gap is not caused by discrimination but by personal choices instead of accepting that there are just different financial decisions that most women make let's change the entire work schedule structure of jobs in order to benefit women who make different decisions yes this totally doesn't seem absolutely insane and idiotic at all nope not at all someonepleasehelpthisworld-,NOT

minute :10 you say that men earn 400k on average while women earn 0 less at 250k?? hope it was an honest mistake and not trying to sound more alarming than it already is the correct answer is 7.5 less.,NOT
the main argument here is that the wage gap exists because women do more housework and childcare duties therefore they can't focus on their careers as much as a man who does less childcare and housework. the problem with this is that it assumes women are forced into this role by the patriarchy and they don't want to be the main childcare provider by their own choice.. which is largely not true of course there are individual situations where it may be the case that the man wants to do more or equal childcare to the woman and that couple is free to factor that into the way they situate their lives which i'm sure does happen already) but by and large most women prefer to do more of the childcare and let the man do more of the bread-winning so they can spend their time with their child while they're growing up and less slaving away at work while the child is with a someone else.. and both parents are doing this willingly as what they see as the best way to raise the child.. and of course no one wants to do housework generally speaking but whoever is home more will obviously be the one to do more housework.. in this case women are home more so they end up doing more i'm a woman in a thankfully childless relationship with a man and i make more and therefore he does more housework and takes care of the animals where as most of my coworkers who are nearly all female mothers prefer to work less and stay home with their kids like i described and i am an exception of sorts also the single mom issue is a totally separate situation that wasn't addressed in this video and i will say that they tend to be royally screwed because they can't focus all their time on children or on their careers which is why a free to hire government salary nanny would be a great thing to incorporate into the usa basing it off of how it's done in france that way the single moms pay wouldn't go right back into baby sitting while they're trying to make a profit on top of all their other bills and expenses that come with children._,NOT
yes yes oh my lord yyyyyeeesssss 😭 thank you trish i hope you enjoy ths vegan diet 💚💚💚,NOT

i have the exact same reaction as piers morgan.....when i ate meat i replayed the part of when he took a bite of plant-based burger or whatever it was his face contorted even before he took a bite most people react with disgust when tasting something they don't like......after they've taken a bite he had already made up his mind he wasn't going to like it but his facial expression revealed that it wasn't all that bad but because he had bashed vegan food.....and of course because of his narcissistic personality he is belligerent and narrow minded they can't admit when they are wrong.....their way or the highway i went vegetarian in 000 i went vegan in 010 i became vegan after cutting out one food after another to figure out what was wrong with me i suffered gastrointestinal issues for years when i cut out dairy i was absolutely staggered at how much better i felt in one week i thought it's got to be a fluke so i introduced small amounts of dairy thinking a little won't make any difference all i had was one small in x in x /4in slice of cheddar cheese i was in unbearable agony all night i had stomach and intestinal cramping that rivaled being in labor it was actually worse than labor because i was in horrible pain the entire night and part of the next day i've never had a childbirth labor last that long i gave my sister the remaining cheddar cheese package.....she isn't vegan......i'm the only vegan in my family there are millions of people who are allergic to nuts the food industry now has clear labeling for nut allergies it can be life threatening for some people to consume foods that contain nuts those of us who are severely lactose intolerant have struggled for years to find non-dairy substitutes my best friend was vegan and told me about a website that would help me a lot it was peta i was heartbroken disgusted and angry when i looked at videos of farm animals being tortured every day after they suffer unimaginable agonizing pain just so people can have their meat i never really liked the taste of meat it always tasted like blood to me but because my parents were meat eaters i was forced to eat it along with the rest of my family the only way i could eat it was to mix tiny pieces into my mashed potatoes now as a  year old grandma i continue to refuse to enable industries that callously and inhumanly torture farm animals.,NOT

maybe you're just trish and you don't need to put labels on yourself just do you date who you want dress how you want stop saying what you are and just be,NOT
also people obsessed with the wage gap i want to make this as clear as possible going around and blaming some secret sexist cabal of men and taking it out on your co-workers and claiming that they're women-haters or w/e is stupid men and women in theory strive equally to get paid and earn raises however a store that employs 0-5 people may have only - people actually in control of the salary those two to three people may or may not be as sexist as you think they are but taking it out on your co-worker who is more interested in getting home to snuggle up to his so and spending time with the family and is doing his best to keep himself awake and in a positive mood while pouring over boring as hell spread-sheets or putting up with some idiot customer who firmly believes that 50 off applies to every item in the store instead of a specific product is only going to earn you animosity he probably doesn't set the wages he may even be mad as hell that he's putting in overtime and working extra hard but got passed over so the ceo could give himself a nice bonus he may even have a wife/sister/daughter who isn't getting paid what she should be and the entire family is suffering for it or he's doing his absolute best in his dwindling spare time to fix that accusing him of sexism is about as useful as getting mad at a chicken and accusing it of causing obesity.,NOT

15:5 can someone tell me who this guy is?,NOT
to fix this gap you don't make jobs more flexible time-wise that's just stupid what you do is make sure that domestic duties especially involving children are split equally between husband and wife this way women can have kids and still have a career in a job that demands a lot of time also women are treated unfairly in the workplace they're seen as less effective and evaluated under harder criteria than a man is in order to get promoted to fix this gap we need to make sure women are respected and seen just as capable as a man is and also make sure that domestic work is something everyone should do and is not considered unmanly” because a lot of these things are not outright discrimination and mostly on the subconscious level we do not realize it is a problem but it is and it has shown the consequences.,NOT
she said i don't like to be the center of attention except when i like to be the center of attention wtf i think i lost at least a dozen brain cells watching this video😂,ABU

todo lo mostrado en este documental est basado en países desarrollados pero creo que también debería de poner más nfasis en países en sub-desarrollo en estos países se tiene la creencia de que este estilo de vida sustentable es muy caro espero que en estos países se logre algún cambio y poco a poco el veganismo se haga más conocido!!!,NOT
trish just made an update on going vegan please react she is getting great results.,NOT
anecdote women often choose aspects of a job that don't have anything to do with pay for example my boss is a single mother who is now a department head at my small company she used to hold another lower paying position she is still being paid at the scale of that lower position even though she's been dept head for years she knows that if she left she could make considerably more elsewhere why does she stay because she is allowed to pretty much make her own schedule from day to day and to telecommute when she feels like it without even asking permission i don't think there has been a single day where she was here when i arrived and only took a one hour lunch and was here when i left her child has a million extracurricular activities and she can attend to all of them this may be an extreme example but women make these sorts of trade-offs more often than men and it's because they want to.,NOT
i'm sorry but these are guys no matter how you put it they have a dick they are a guy these have a pussy they are a girl say a college recruiter is at a meet these two guys overshadow those girls that have worked to get to their level i think those guys should race as the gender god gave them.,ABU

"""but years out of business school things looked really different men were earning an average salary of 400,000 while women were earning 0 less 250,00 on average. that statement starting at like :05 is wrong women were earning 2.5 of men's salary which is different not to take away from the video just a correction",NOT
maybe women make less because they do not have the same pressure men have to get a well paying job is generally considered a bit embarrassing if a man makes less than his wife so the man is pressured to work more and try harder for better jobs,NOT
love how raw n real you keep it,NOT

"the problem with the wage gap and other problems with equality is how people look at statistics i'm not sure what it's up to now but the figure is around 5% that is that women on average across a lifetime earn about 5 of what a man earns on average across a lifetime when i see just that statistic i look at it and think that's an interesting statistic i wonder why that happens? but the wage warriors and equality of outcome warriors look at it and think that's unequal that's a problem what are the horrible reasons for this occurring probably sexism i am going to prove it's sexism.""",NOT
we could tackle this problem indirectly by guaranteeing paid maternity/paternity leave sick leave and vacation time for all full time workers.,NOT
this is all correct but take in factors such as social pressures it is more expected for a women to give up work temporarily or permanently in order to take care of their children which is unfair on both women and men also a company is more likely to promote a man over a women especially if she is of the age where most women have children because maternity leave is expensive for companies to deal with again i believe that this is unfair i think that a way to reduce the gender pay gap is to increase the length of paternity leave to the length of maternity leave not only to eradicate the inequality but also so that a man can have the necessary time with his child,NOT
so you can be mentally ill and play make believe in all other facets of life but once it comes to sports you draw the line sounds about right for the libtards.,ABU
this makes me think about my years in high school i don't know how many times i was called gay for being into singing and theatre instead of football or baseball maybe i'm gay.. lol,NOT
i think its funny that people dont realize free lee does meth.. like are you serious ,ABU
please make a video on the whaling that is happening in the faroe islands right now people need to know,NOT
let them do it tbh let them go and correct this injustice.. let them go to every single woman and every single man in the same position compare their earnings and correct the differences based on gender you know what will happen nothing the exact same thing that's happened to it despite all the equality laws that have been put in place over the past sixty years you know why nothing has happened because in order to solve a problem the problem has to actually be there to solve. if it's not then you're not doing anything are you?,NOT
a lot of people use this explanation as an opportunity to be complacent in preventing workplace inequality it's fine that women are paid less because they take care of their kids sucks for them such is life. in reality workplaces should be child friendly in that they offer support to working moms working moms are citizens too and should have equal opportunity in the workplace they shouldn't be punished for yielding a new generation.,NOT
chipotle has great vegan options! get a veggie burrito just say no cheese and no sour cream  also cinnamon twists from taco bell are vegan! and trader joes has some bomb soy ice cream,NOT
u havent posted a video in daysssss,NOT
this is so so amazing i just hope people don't beat her up if she's not 00 vegan from the start and scare her away because this is so important.,NOT
woop! i knew she'd come around!!,NOT
this video didn't address race at all white women make even more than women of color typically and i feel like you can't have a conversation about wage gap without addressing that did women of color also earn closer to what white women earned in jobs with more flexible hours?,NOT
how do they have an advantage they're running,NOT
the meat and dairy industry is gonna start some really dark measures very very soon.,NOT
7:5 from one troll to another lol,NOT
oh no trish.. no...,NOT
happy whole food vegan here let's promote a true and nutritive plant based diet and not so much these overly processed faux meat and cheese they're good occasionally but can't be staples these are transition products. but if you really wanna get all the benefits of a vegan diet and impact as little as possible the planet cook your own food choose fresh products fill half of your plate with veggies everyday and don't encourage compagnies like tyson and other animal abusers brands just because they made a tasty veggie burger come on....let's stick to real food:),NOT
don't they hormone boosters or some shit ,NOT
i have never clicked a video faster i've been vegan for around months and it makes me feel and look so much healthier be sure to buy very dense fruits such as mangoes and dates  water-based fruits have less calories and will leave you feeling pretty hungry throughout the day another thing you can make are vegan burritos with beans rice avocados and you can add beefless crumbles if you'd like i 10 recommend gardein meat substitutes if you begin craving meat  their chicken tenders beefless burgers and pork sliders are so delicious remember to carb the f** up potatoes rice and healthy breads and pastas are your best friend make sure to check the breads and pastas for eggs and milk) they do not make you gain weight but provide glucose to your brain and keep you from being hungry throughout the day you should do a vegan taco bell mukbang! everything there could be made vegan i love the layer burrito with no cheese no sour cream and add potatoes and pico! xx,NOT
heyy freelee could you please make a video on why you have to carb the fuck up caus i was talking to my mom about becoming vegan and she still doesn't understand,NOT
the people who disliked are radical feminists.,NOT
what if i kinda don't mind being a guy in a way but i prefer and want to present myself as female am i still considered trans?,NOT
she shouldve done a bit more research before making her video and told everyone from the start its not a troll video and shes 00 serious i do think she is genuinely super confused about her identity.,NOT
when you have no content left...,NOT
it's an earnings gap ughhhhhhh,NOT
u can be gender fluid and have he/him pronouns but calling yourself trans is offensive,NOT
here is a challenge for people who believe in the gender pay gap find me a man and a woman who's salaries differ when they both work in the same industry for the same company and perform the same role as well as work the same hours have the same experience qualifications and education while being the same age don't worry i'll be waiting.,NOT
until women start preferring cute men who make substantially less money than they do nothing will change men work longer and harder to make more money because it gets them more access to more pretty women.,NOT
i'm a bit confused so the wage gap exists but is different in different job fields or does it not exist,NOT
she's not trans she's doing it for attention,NOT
i can't believe half the ads on tv etc are meat and dairy products and that corporate slave who calls himself a journalist murdcoh's cock puppet.. what's his name? who crawls to serve the meat industry.. yeah...,NOT
i don't think i've ever seen so many dislikes on a video bravo 🙄,NOT
if you're craving anything aka like pizza or whatever the gardien vegan pizza pockets are soooooo good 😍 as a person who was transitioning into veganism it's so good and will keep you full ps love you ️,NOT
trish remember you can buy vegan cook books and online recipes tofu is a great alternative for meat and talk to a doctor about protein deficiency because you need to make sure you do this the right way or else you'll fall back i'm not vegan im just educated,NOT
you love meat inside you tho,NOT
you probably need rice,NOT
there are a few good points in here but with the amount of bs and lack of research they are overlooked i implore ya t to do some research on gender fluid also never relate someone who is lgbtq to someone with a disability that's all i got. for now.,NOT
why do you think that women gravitate toward industries such as social services and education perhaps it is because those jobs facilitate child caring duties it is undeniable that the majority female children are raised to see their mothers taking the lead in this regard to the point that even on an unconscious level careers can be influenced by the structural demands on women the disparity between women and men is not just on an income level.,NOT
trisha just made a video of her emotionally eating cruel animal products please respond and help her see that it doesn't have to be animal products she eats when she's upset that she can eat whatever plant products and make her feel satisfied and make her feel better,NOT
does she realize how offensive this is to gigi one of her best friends on the platform who is actually transgender like please sit down and do your research before blabbing on the internet for attention that's all this is it's just for attention so just report the video and move on,NOT
honestly just that clip of the farm to fridge in this vid made me go vegan.,NOT
what i don't get is how vegans try to push it on other people i'll eat what i want and you eat what you want i don't push eating meat and such on vegans so they shouldn't push going vegan.,NOT

i have nothing personal against lgbt yet even a baby would know this is unfair...stop,NOT
i am a conservative i am a christian(naturally a poor christian) i know that the whole lgbtq+ i believe the trans movement is a farce and most people are just misguided and mislead they are used for an agenda i have no problem calling a transgender person by their preferred pronouns but i won't call a biological he a she or vice verse but you ms white i have no issue saying she” you are one-in-i-don't-know-how many.,NOT

i'm so happy veganism is blowing up because it will soon reveal just how unhealthy it truly is with all the ex vegans coming forward only those with low iq and zero research skills believe the vegan propaganda docos like game changers veganism has a super high drop out rate you will look forward to losing your period brain fog insomnia constant hunger irritability bloating weight gain acne muscle loss depression anxiety nose bleeds losing teeth etc yes its very healthy and natural....not,NOT
oreos are vegan just sayin,NOT
ok let me get this right girls get man when guys say we are superior than girls but when something like this comes up girls wanna say oh no guys are better than girls at everything,NOT
my experience has been that i find a greater majority of men at an executive level than women but i see far more women at middle management roles there will be a trend shift as women take on more and more executive roles it seems inevitable.,NOT

cauliflower buffalo wings are actually really good xd,NOT
i wish i had more people like you growing up i had a lot of people like trisha tell me because i wasn't stereotypical woman that i was trans.,NOT
i think she's a flamboyant gamine which means shes a female with a higher yang balance but some features of yin like tina turner audrey hepburn and lady gaga i'm a guy whose almost the oppisite in body typing i'm a theatrical romantic so i'm a guy who has a higher yin female energy/lines balance examples being prince johnny depp and sure sometimes i feel way more fem especially around other men but that doesn't mean i'm trans or nothing like that i can't believe she really said 1000% ,NOT
trisha i'm gay black and trans huh at this point shes basically scarlett johansson's movie career.,NOT

"get potatoes,rice and pasta vegetables etc try high carb low fat diet",NOT
coming from a trans man this isn't how it fucking works trish you need gender dysphoria to be trans gender dysphoria is feeling a disconnect and discomfort in your biological gender's body and you clearly don't have that issue trans men can be gay yes trans men can like makeup and fashion yes but trans men absolutely do not want to be seen as a female? that's against everything we stand for and have to go through this shit isn't a joke trish being trans isn't something you randomly use as an excuse for not liking straight men or for feeling insecure about being called a bitch because you are assertive you are one of the reasons people outside of the community see us as a joke i hope this is either a shitty joke that you somehow thought would be funny or that people realize this isn't how being ftm works.,ABU
yassssss!! this is great,NOT
your boys end of period idk why people entertaining this crap,ABU

lol 😂😂😂😂 wage gap is a myth,NOT
"""and although that statement is factually true... cite your sources honey",NOT
remember their faces people they will be remembered as cheaters in women sports history,ABU
i need to ask a question i have compared my pay to women at the same job and it is the same pay so where is the gap i have looked at men in higher payed jobs and noticed they usually involve risk taking of some form so the gap must probably then exist in these levels of employment my question now is if you see fit to charge a man more for insurance because of risky behavior why dont you see it fit to pay men for these traits?,NOT
you can eat veggie burgers beans smoothie bowls bean burritos a lot of fruit hummus and carrots and much more! btw you can have everything vegan,NOT
almost a good and balanced report but your premise still expects society to fix the choices which women make voluntarily which is more important child-rearing or making money why is money the only measure of a successful life and the only way in which feminists feel that a women's worth should be measured what about happiness and fulfilment and family many women do and always will put these aspects of life ahead of making money this will never change and therefore the wage-gap read earnings gap will never disappear.,NOT
trish would sell her family plus the dog and the parrot for money and attention...🤢🤢🤮,NOT
i support trish but i'm so confused apologies but the only thing i really got was trish not wanting to be a woman because of society but i hope she's happy.,NOT
i don't see gender so there is no wage gap.,NOT
men work longer case closed,NOT
“if that makes sense everyone else no honey it doesn't make sense,NOT
or maybe just maybe it doesn't exist,NOT
those are guys.,ABU
dem niggaz are boys!,ABU
because you can't have a good old boy network with outold boys keep up the work of republican facist propaganda you obviously have never had a job or your a business owner yes your gender is a problem why isn't a man doing this report this college must be sponsored by nazi's.,ABU
the societal change social justice warriors want mean the majority are left out in favor of the minority the left just never fails to screw things up.,NOT
uhh no the facts you showed actually revealed that the male dominance of the high paying jobs which happens because the society and our culture encourage boys about having such job a lot more than girls creating the wage gap.(no it's not because boys are better at stem the science itself already proved that girls are just as good as boys at math and science and etc. also since our businesses were run by mostly males since the beginning of the word business the culture actually is more fit to men which also is the big reason of the wage gap women are discriminated just look at the facts,NOT
all that botox is making her sick.,NOT
she has already broken it...,NOT
it's odd that you never hear anyone ever talk about the fact that in the porn industry women actors are paid about ten times as much as men actors for doing the same job.,NOT
i identify as i'm gonna kill myself after all the bs i just heard.,NOT
feminazis always try to play this off by saying that women are swayed towards certain jobs from a young age😂,NOT
did you consider sex worker jobs which is totally in favour of women no you didn't women don't pay for sex men do that covers for the gap anyways.,NOT
they don't belong there!! compete in your own transgender division,ABU
your voice changes in your videos alot,NOT
she's not trans and gigi does not pass he's a dude.,ABU
it's funny how this video disproves the wage gap,NOT
why dont women just have less kids i dont think any would really mind if a family has one or two children instead of or three children also women with a lot of kids almost never work if you have three kids then u really shouldnt expect to go back to work until right around when the gap shrinks again.,NOT
estrogen does not replace male hormones why transgender have their own class cheaters,ABU
who else is looking for feminists in the comments?,NOT
wow and i thought i was doing alright when i got out of business school i wasn't even in the same bracket as these men or women.,NOT
i was going to tweet you about this!,NOT
from my understanding of this video its the fact that women are expected to have worst paying jobs and are expected to be home more,NOT
freelee can shut the fuck now smh,ABU
try eat things like rice or homemade fries sweet potato fries or roast sweet potato and vegetables try include legumes like chickpeas or make some houmous if you don't like plain chickpeas and make soups and stuff for the week so that it's easier not to resort to snacking.,NOT
holy fuck.. it's people like that who make me hate being trans even more.. it's like they fucking glorify it.. it's not fun. it's not cool. it's not any of those things it's a fucking struggle and it can break you down.. even if she is just trolling that shits not cool.. you don't joke bout that shit because it's serious and people like me suffer from it every waking moment..,NOT
fuck yes finally!!!!,NOT
you deserve to hit m soon!,NOT

freelee will you do a video about emily skye she is also an aussie very famous on social media and recently on a magazine she recommends a diet of mostly chicken and steamed vegetables though and says that she has a very sensitive tummy maybe raw till will help her digestion she is already fit looking and very sweet but i think she is a huge influence on many girls and the whole white chicken is healthy myth is just being reaffirmed thanks!,NOT
just because you feel like a girl don't mean you're a girl why people gotta make shit complicated ,NOT

"""medical science is only in its infancy yet it has shown that our natural diet is that which grows out of the ground. abdu'l-bahá bahai faith",NOT
it's sounds like you are nonbinary not transgender,NOT
so more women should enter science and tech cool why aren't they and why do they expect the business fields to change working hours for women's needs instead of planning ahead for children and choosing your field accordingly?,NOT
this video doesn't address hiring promotion policies or the fact that two people doing the same job may be paid differently usually the woman earning less some women are completely willing to work long hours and yet they still get paid less also according to the acfe women are less likely to commit fraud so maybe companies should consider hiring more women into higher level positions.,NOT
she is about as trans as my straight basic bitch white self is .< i literally hate people like her because it does create this mockery of people i know who have gone/are going through the struggles of transitioning and it just sucks that she's profiting off of it why is the internet not flipping out over this?,NOT

i'm so proud of you and don't worry no one is perfect there will be times where you might backslide and eat something non-vegan sometimes even on accident things we might think are vegan turn out not to be the point is don't quit don't get discouraged ignore the negative people and focus on the people that want to support you and see you succeed you're beautiful inside and out and you deserve the happiest and healthiest life you can lead.,NOT

no she ist,NOT
go off queen 😍,NOT
holly shit prager u seems to have gotten something right?!! wow... just wow of course they didn't get here through a critical analysis of evidence but rather because in this one case the evidence does not contradict their political narrative seeeerrriously can we dispense with fake universities now or should we elect another con artist president or two first?,NOT
lmao at everyone who actually believes that shes going vegan!,NOT
oml ppl here are triggered typing up whole freaking paragraphs...smh this is youtube lol,NOT
thank you for covering this trisha video i felt very confused by what she was trying to say every sentence was either a contradiction or assumptions.,NOT
did no one listen to her she said she's only going vegan for weeks not a total lifestyle change just a diet change.,NOT
i work in a warehouse where they actualy pay quite good its male dominated job obviously anyway they decided to start recruit women who actualy managed to stay - days max and left because they couldn't handle thy physical job,NOT

my two sons and  have been both vegans for two years the younger one got rid of his asthma and is free from medications since vegans they have never been sick not even a runny nose and they are stronger then ever before i have been vegan for two years but  years vegetarian before i am writing a book about veganism in czech republic spreading the word in my home country too.,NOT
i saw her post this shit and i've been waiting for this video since lol,NOT
i've watched the vegan documentaries and none of them point to me a clear as to why look all these athletes and game changers look they have to eat the best food this veganism advertising is bs so is the meat industry is bs all these stars promoting veganism as if it was their life-style always is bs as well i don't buy this bs never going vegan it's a scam and so is eating today's meat is a scam what is not a scam is what is written in the bible every moving thing that lives shall be food for you and as i gave you the green plants i give you everything. so this vegan bs is wrong wrong wrong if you want to be a vegan fine but don't use it as a religion why meat is not good for the body in todays world is because it's overly processed bible wasn't speaking about processed half-assed meat it was talking about the real grass fed without anti-biotics flooded with drugs meat i hate being vegan and i like eating meat but neither is correct because so many things are over processed in todays world.,NOT
they should be competing in against men or other transgenders and not against women,ABU
if companies can get away with paying women less then why don't they fire all men and hire only women up to 0% of a companys expense are salaries.,NOT
"are you kidding me id love to make over 50,000.. keeping this wage gap to only people in college is dumb a lot of people don't have college graduates and would love to make 100k a year when talking about the wage gap why don't we talk about the wealth gap i can't care about a gender-based wage gap when so many people are in poverty sorry just my two cents",NOT
someone say something ,NOT
i love that you're trying out veganism!  i do think you should have bought more fruit and fruit with more calories but this is fantastic i highly recommend eating lots of rice potatoes and pasta because those are very high calorie high carb foods and they're so yummy too!,NOT

if women got paid 2 less for the exact same work wouldn't companies only employ women cause it'd be cheaper and they'd get the same results.,NOT
id fuckthe shit outta that grandma,ABU
there is a difference between wage gap and earnings gap and feminists don't seem to know this,NOT
it makes sense if women want to get paid as much as men they should do a good of job if they do and are discriminatated because of having children then it's the companies fault.,NOT
i hope she still goes through with it although she is in the middle of a really bad breakup right now,NOT
this is interesting however the reason why women make different choices on career and pay is because our society constantly influences women on the idea that they aren't worth as much as men and that they cannot amount to that by that regard if i was raised with alot of influences that my gender is subordinate to another would greatly affect my choices for my career and my actions to ask for higher pay honestly your channel is no better than the young turks or breitbart.,NOT
me me me me me me,NOT
lies gender equality is already a thing propaganda,NOT
::pls read this lol it may be helpful: make sure you take vitamin b1 and get all the nutrients you need and you're probably gonna get cravings most people do at the beginning of their journey:) especially knowing you hehe so i recommend getting fake meat products such as gardein products they're soooo yummy and make your cravings dissapear:) eat lots of beans and spinach and get yummy coconut milk ice cream or sorbet stuff it's my favourite fucken thing and ugh just yummmmm!!!! and also it's not an easy change it's huge and takes commitment but if you stick with it you wonttttt regret it!! don't be afraid to eat a chicken nugget every once in a blue moon if that's what you're really craving cutting yourself off completely at all times especially when you first start out may just make you resent the vegan diet even more!(for some people it's better to just go cold turkey(or tofurkey in this case)and that's cool too:) you're still making a huge difference with this choice and i'm so happyyyy:)))),NOT

i'm vegan and there are a couple meals i eat that are super yummy!! white rice or wild rice with steamed broccoli and carrots with whatever sauce is your favorite over the top is so good if you put orange sauce or soy sauce over the top it's just like it's from panda for breakfast a smoothie or a banana or two and some english muffins with peanut butter or pb on them is delicious! and pasta is always a good option when you are super hungry and want some carbs lol mix in some marinara and veggies and it's bomb these are just some foods that i ate alot when i was transitioning cause thy were things i already ate when i wasn't vegan i love you trish ️❤️,NOT
why do people still even have to make this video?,NOT
i've been vegan for weeks now and i lost kg i'm so happy,NOT
thank you i just had a convo with someone about how people don't understand that you can be masculine and feminine within the same fucking body as humans we are a spectrum of things a lot of people don't seem to understand you can be a feminine guy or a tomboy...and shockingly you don't have to be a gay man if your feminine or a lesbian if you're tomboy you can be whatever you f e e l you may want something for clout but that doesn't make it true although thinking on this a few days later i'm not sure if she is just having a mental breakdown in general and i hope she gets some good therapy.,NOT
another cause is that women tend to choose similar jobs and careers meanwhile men are way more diversify these creates a lot more workers that are needed in certain jobs so the competence in those jobs rise and the salary of all those professionals is reduced why women choose the same hobbies and careers the answer is easy. culture inertia since religión times most religions did not allow women to do the same things that men did they could not study work in some jobs or do almost nothing more than take care of their childs. that is the gap you are looking for.,NOT
" weeks later,back to meat classic click bait.",NOT

it was so insulting to all the other athletes when the father said that track isn't even that important to them this is the state tournament not just a regular track meet a lot of girls college plans may depend on these post season tournaments you're pushing your agenda and interfering with what the other girls have worked so hard for and it's not even that important to you? that's disgusting and selfish.,NOT

"i'm no feminist but if you are going to present a proper argument you can't repeatedly twist facts with vague statements...1 why don't businesses hire only woman? because when i hire someone for a job there are literally  years worth of discrimination laws that prevent me from making my decision based on gender oh and your reproductive sex is not listed under qualifications  they don't take into account occupation no they only take into account literally all occupations held by both/either genders making it abundantly non-bias .""position are you reflecting on men holding higher payed positions illustrating a gender-based inequality because it sounds like you did  education people who attend a university will make on average million dollars more over  years and there are more woman than there are men in college so logically shouldn't education result in woman making more hours per week we literally just heard you mention both parties working full-time rendering that irrelevant to the statistic ....",NOT

unfair advantage...gee ya think sorry but i don't feel sorry for those who started this crap to begin with and are now crying fowl.,ABU

i believe people shouldnt be offended by trisha doing these things even though she has a big following and a priviledge of that power' i highly believe trisha makes these videos as a therapy out loud thinking she just says what she feels and she doesnt know or care about the consequences because thats for later to face she loves the attention and doesnt know how to balance her issues,NOT
she did say she's trying vegan for weeks she didn't say anything about doing it for life.,NOT
i felt bad eating a burrito while watching this,NOT

whoa surprisingly great job vox.,NOT
just so you know you might gain weight/see no difference in the beginning after a couple of months you will see so much progress!,NOT

am  years old and live in texas i live in a household of meat eaters and i personally i've been pescatarian for about to months i recently made the switch to vegetarianism and i really really really really really really really really really really want to be vegan i could've made the switch instantly a yr ago to plant based but it would've been too hard on my family which is what's keeping me from it now it is tough considering my family torments criticizes and teases me about my lifestyle choices my family is proud and supportive of me even if it may seem otherwise and helps me afford tofu extra produce and etc along with monthly doctoral check ups since i am an avid athlete both in volleyball and school sports i try to cut out dairy whenever i possibly can i substitute milk's cheeses yogurts and etc for the plant-based versions and it is more accessible considering my mom is dairy intolerant so i practically am vegan i am very mature for my age and try toeducate myself on the topic pretty regularly i have seen all documentaries i know of on pbn netflix and a surplus on youtube i don't think my family fully grasps the logistics of veganism i have tried numerous times to get my family to watch documentaries with me but repeatedly have been bombarded with no(s and attacks on my lifestyle choices when in reality all i'm trying to do is to help educate and inform my family about their daily choices and to help them understand my perspective my dad has made numerous comments saying you only eat grass or you need to actually do research when all my dad has done is listened to a few podcasts of biased farmers i eventually tracked my mom into watching the game changers with me on netflix by telling her it was a documentary based on athletes which is partially true but it ended up practically pointless because she fell asleep  minutes into the movie i have tried numerous times since then to have her watch some with me but and i quote i don't want to watch cute little animals die as an answer which proves she knows what she does on an everyday basis is morally environmentally ethically and for health reasons is wrong!! it frustrates the crap out of me!!! for goodness sake she's freaking dietitian especially for diabetes which is caused by... oh you guessed it the saturated fat and cholesterol is animal products!! ughhhhhhhhhhh! please help me! what can i do any suggestions to help me convince my parents my point of view to watch a documentary anything! pleaseeeeeeeeeeee!! oh ps pbn i was literally waiting for so long for this documentary to come out and when i saw it in my suggestions/home page i said skrew sleep i'm watching this lol😂😂😂,NOT
why she says about gender norms not being related to gender is so true.. i'm a mtf transgender and i wear makeup.. black lipstick and eyeshadow cause i'm goth and if i see a dress that's goth i'll wear it.. but i don't identify as a female i'm just a more feminine male...,NOT
so you have a pussy or dick because i'm trying to eat some ass,ABU
ill tell you what i learned from being vegan for years im eating meat now because my b1 was heading towards the danger zone dont let that deter you though i just sucked at being vegan lol as much as i took pride in making the food i was still a pretty lazy chef and was very uncreative when it came to eating out but these were the good bits   the best time to eat melon is either at the start of your day or when you havent eaten in a fair while as melons have a pretty high water content and will run into anything ingested before it  when i was trying i beat a lot of unhealthy food cravings by studying the contents of each thing identifying what part of the food it was that i was craving and then substituting the unhealthy thing for a healthy option chocolate craving was magnesium fast food craving was usually fat and would be replaced with an avocado nuts or whatever)  i couldnt afford vegan cheese so veg pizza with whatev i could find to add flavour was a staple,NOT
"i'm sorry not really tho but that was very offensive people don't choose to identify as schizofrenic or mpd... people whom put those two diagnosis into the same box"" are not suffering from either of them she is misinforming people about alot of shit in this video and as a schizofrenic i take that bit to heart.. i know that was a small part of the context in the video but people whom don't suffer from theese things watching might take those facts with them out into world...",NOT
hackers be like,NOT
i kinda wish people would just have a little faith in her like.. idk at least she's putting forth effort not everyone can go vegan overnight i get that baby steps guys trust that she will get there her mind set is changing there will be slip ups but if everyone through in the towel after every mistake how would anything ever change she's bound to make mistakes bound to slip up but that doesn't mean she should give up or stop.,NOT
the major thing about the wage gap is that it is false taking the average of anything is not scientific i'll play the average game on the opposite side on average men do more overtime take less time off don't take parental leave without losing their job and are better negotiators taking the initial salary of somebody is pure bs because it's up to the employer i'm too tired of writing these to not press the shoeonhead button,NOT
listen mate while the wage gap might not be .7 cents to the dollar which is actually the stats for white women only women of color earn even less) it is still real there have been countless studies by universities such as harvard and oxford that show that for almost identical jobs for people in similar situations women are paid significantly less businesses don't hire all women because studies show that business owners tend to prefer male workers even if the woman is just as qualified or even better if you guys want to believe this it's because you've believed it all along and like hearing your opinion voiced with facts which in itself is fine because everyone does but the thing is that facts are not things to be believed they are things to be understood this woman obviously has done well enough or is ignorant enough to not have experienced the need for feminism but that doesnt mean we disregard facts her presentation is obviously meant to be persuasive not informative which of course effects how the whole thing should be viewed im not trying to start anything and if you want to stick to your opinions fine but don't spew this out as fact because it has statistical evidence because that hurts the livelihoods of most working women.,NOT
sick freaks they should be put in strait jackets and locked up for life.,ABU
aguante el veganismo vieja!!!,NOT
all these intelligent economists and they never come out and discuss these things don't they realize their opinion is highly valued why do i only see milo a troll albeit has facts but not an economist argue with dumb feminists i want to see a debate with a phd economist saying there is sexism vs no i probably won't understand most of it but it would be interesting there might not be any economists to even debate one side but that's the thing i don't know their opinions on it so i wouldn't know!,NOT

it's not like women were made to take care of children,ABU
is society trying to pretend that tomboys don't exist or have we simply forgotten people who say that they are non-binary or insert obscure gender here are so weird because gender presentation / physical sex and personality / gender presentation there's nothing wrong with not being masculine or feminine but it seems as though people are just trying to gain oppression points by making up genders trans people people who are actually trans and not just transtrenders are valid because they have an actual health condition their transgenderness is vindicated by science but the trans community needs to practice gatekeeping any trans person needs to have doctoral proof that they have the medical condition.,ABU

if a feminist tries to bash you with the wage gap myth just show them this vid,NOT
a very nice and well put together video with a lot of great data there is just one problem all of it is about earnings not necesserily wage as a matter of fact it is illegal to discriminate on gender for the exact same job equal pay act 963 wether a difference in earnings is something that has to be corrected is therefore debatable i bet you could make a very similar chart for iq and get a difference in earnings not saying women are dumber then men that wouldn't be based on an outward characteristic the problem i encounter here is the idea that the desired goal is to have an equal pay across the bord regardless of extra hours worked negotiations in wage or sick days etc there are a lot of variables that strifing for equality of outcome as equalizing earnings would be becomes a case of holding back people that want and can do more in a sense it is opressing them by not allowing them to choose to excell wether man or woman doesn't really matter to me quotas and wage redistribution are not solutions.,NOT
awesome vegan food includes rice beans different kinds noodles bread soy/almond milk nuts quinoa couscous vegetables and don't forget all the yummy spices and sauces you can get/make lucky for you living in la means you have a shit ton of vegan restaurants and places to go to love you and so proud of you xx,NOT

i want to go vegan but i'm only  and my parents aren't supportive about it.😥,NOT
if you know for a fact that you would most likely never have sex with them then why not be attracted to gays/lesbians?,NOT
this is ridiculous...the man was like the girls should run faster...he wants people to be sensitive to his feelings of becoming a woman and isn't sensitive to the fact that he clearly without a shadow of a doubt has a unfair advantage in the sport against women...no professional association is going to allow them to compete against woman so no college should give them a scholarship when they technically are on steroids to win...futures are being taken away from rightful athletes that are hoping to gain an opportunity to go for scholarships...like i said ridiculous...,ABU
i believe it could be that she's been so traumatized by men in her life that she thinks if she becomes one it will fix her pain i also think she might be in love with her gay best friend she's been known to transform into whatever the guy she's interested wants she's admitted she's very prone to obsessing over things.,NOT

even though this video was told by a left-wing pansexual and black person feminists and sjws would still find something that is biased about it you can´t win this fight only hope that human evolution will find a way to eradicate these imbeciles in the future.,ABU
smart as a marble please blaire,NOT
the worst part about these comments are that teachers are are teaching this false belief that the wage gap exists at my old job i was the only female who would work doubles and be there when no one wanted to when it came time i got the raises and then became a manager hard work pays off.,NOT
wow good for you!,NOT

whole house is pink but do you girl.,NOT
yaaass!! i'm so proud of you trish omg o i just went vegan a few weeks ago too so we can get healthier and help the animals together  also the only tricky thing about being a vegan is the byproducts that aren't obvious like whey and carmine but once you get that list down you're good to go! the peta site helps me a lot with that stuff they have some really helpful lists of vegan foods so i'd for sure check it out you have a huge following of people who love you so if you do end up staying vegan you would really inspire a lot of people to make the change as well which would make a huuuge difference! it would be amazing  keep it up you're gonna love it so much i promise d btw i love you trish  you're my fav!),NOT
i have come up with a sure fire plan to end the wage and male white privilege gap all people are declared male it's pretty easy to do in canada ask lauren southern of rebel media) then just check the white box it doesn't matter if you aren't that race ask rachel dolezal sp? and shaun king they identified as black but when discovered that they really aren't black they identify as trans-black so everyone should just say they are male and trans-white easy no wage gap and everyone is privileged ,NOT
very well said christina,NOT
freelee just want to say that l think your channel is very relevant to the discussion of diet nutrition and health l have subscribed to it and l will watch your postings even if l don't comment take care.,NOT

if they really dudes fuck yeah its unfair,ABU
this is bs.,NOT
freelee does have a great body but it's not just her being vegan she also rides crazy long bike rides - days a week if you were to eat her diet and not exercise the way she does you would actually gain weight.,NOT
yall dont be such a dick to t! the shit she's saying makes sense if you would bother to listen past the terminology that gets mixed up in here what's being said here is that t from the get go has not really felt like a girl but the reason she was so girly so feminine was to compensate for everyone calling her a boy when she was young when she puts on makeup nails clothes etc etc she's in drag it's a costume it's an outfit the way she describes women makes it clear that she doesn't feel like she's one of them i do agree w some people here that what shes describing here sounds more like being genderfluid than binary trans and i do agree that she's mixing up a lot of words but you cannot blame her for ignorance you cannot thrust someone out from the community for not getting everything 00 right we are not born knowing everything that needs to be and should be said or how to say it you need to learn these things at some point and some people do them later than others i for one completely support t and agree with what she's saying even if she's not doing it perfectly you fucking go it's hard to do shit like this.,NOT
lol i love this freaks show that's happening in the west 😂😂😂,ABU
grilled and seasoned veggies are the best like asparagus zucchini peppers mushrooms etc also rice beans and tortillas are amazing hummus and pita is a good snack:),NOT
yeah frozen fruit is a really good sub for sugary sweets also dry fruit oatmeal is good,NOT
isnt she the same woman who did that video about dogs and asked if they had brains she may have been trolling in that one too but still,NOT
lmfao she is a very handsome,NOT
if you do your research you'll find that the government passed a bill that states that no woman can be paid less than a man working the same job and the same position working the same hours so next time you make a video discriminating against men do some research,NOT
this is the video we neeeed,NOT
hormone therapy can't change male anatomy and build,NOT
you mentioned freelee and i immediately hit the thumbs down and quit watching she might be healthy but she has no right to be a bully to people who are not vegan! felisha bye!,NOT

you should really talk to kallel she has been a vegan for sooo many years.,NOT

the trans athletes have unfair advantages...,NOT
shared on my fb page the films get better and better every year the energy is changing and it shows in their films you can feel the triumph 01 the year of the vegan 02 we liberate mother earth!,NOT
imagine the hate if this video was narrated by a man,NOT
98 people didnt watch the video feminists*  extremists,NOT
she's not going vegan she's trying it for two weeks and i can guarantee she will cave before then it is never a last minute decision to make a lifestyle change and also never a healthy decision freelee is like that annoying jehovah's witness at your door or the person that leaves a business card for their church in your tip jar she thinks you can switch lifestyles at the drop of a dime and that is so unrealistic.,ABU
you tell that to my mom please cause she knows for a fact that men in the same position that she is in earn more,NOT
amazing thank you pbn for all you do to raise awareness 01 the year i became vegan ♥ at almost  i will keep raising awareness for everyone it's well overdue we need to be vegan for the animals for the planet for our health there will be a day where meat/fish/dairy will not be eaten...it's not a dream any longer veganism for life ️,NOT
this is amazing❤️❤️❤️❤️,NOT
woman do get payed less but it depends on the country though i saw this video fully i have done research and i still think there is a wage gape but its not as bad as people think well at least in some countries.,NOT
okay to send the whole video she is transgender or portrays herself identifies to be transgender but she has this connection with gay people so she is a gay transgender now which there is nothing wrong with that let trisha do whatever she wants because she is her own person or he or whenever she he identify as and if you like whatever gender/genders that would be pansexual,NOT
create more categories for those transgender idiots men women transmen transwomen dog car stone tree whatever the fuck they think they are.,ABU
is she going to be vegan or plant based she sounds like she's going to be plant based and not vegan she's calling it a diet rather than a lifestyle.,NOT
really great video quick thought i feel like to voice a right wing opinion to the left we must use a member of a minority to make the statements lest they write the opinions off by calling said speaker a racist or sexist for instance to speak out against feminism it must be a woman or the points will be written of on the basis that the person speaking is a sexist also for a right wing opinion on race to be discussed it must be a non-white person doing the discussion to avoid the points being ignored because the person making them is perceived as a racist just an observation.,NOT
omg you need to react to buzzfeed can u survive a day as a vegan it is terrible,NOT
plant-based does not equal to vegan.,NOT
if the wage gap is real why doesn't companies only hire women?,NOT
what a great documentary subscribed been vegan for weeks!,NOT
these two are males and have a physical advantage over females i have nothing against trans persons but that advantage is unfair.,ABU
at most stores they have meat replacements they taste and look like meat and they're amazing omg,NOT
it's just a medal ok i keep comin in third cuz these dudes keep beating everyone on the girls team for some of these young ppl sports are everything and make a major impact on their futures. there wouldnt be a damn team every parent should pull their child out let them dudes run against each other create a damn transgender team lawd imma start identifying as a trans-white woman i'm done this shit is a complete circus!,ABU
trisha just because you are fugly doesn't mean you can change sex ugly as a woman ugly as a man god insanity abounds.,ABU
i think that these parents are just salty that there kids lost the race.,NOT
i don't care what they transition to even with hormone treatment they still have the muscle mass of males they can identify as females but they are males at the end of the day and it is unfair for them to compete against women it will be interesting to see if they continue their track careers once they leave high school and how if they will be allowed to compete against women.,ABU
how can a woman who was born a woman think to identify as a male or is a female that because she relates more with males identifies as a male i enjoy some of your videos but this is one that no offense confuses the living shit out of me. for the life of me i cannot understand how or why you think your transgender and this video does not explain your thoughts very well at all you cannot be a transgender male and a natural born female that identifies as her natural self it's just not how it works!,NOT
there is no such thing as a gender wage gap that would be highly illegal so stop trying to push the feminist narrative that has be debunked many times over.,NOT
until they can bleed from their cocks every  days they should be banned.,ABU
even if you feel like a girl you have to compete with the boys because you are a boy.,ABU

i never comment on youtube videos but this is too much i have been out as a trans guy for whole years and i almost killed myself because of the people around me and how they were treating me they have gotten better because they understood and years later some people still don't i work for respect everyday and this could take some of that progress away you're not a guy please stop.,NOT
wtf is wrong with her face i'm not being a dick i'm genuently asking did she have an accident was she caught in a fire?,NOT
i love all the sexists clearly not even watching the video the article and video both go into detail that the issue is a matter of inflexibility and increasingly outdated business practices rather than overt sexism this isn't the raving of some tumblrite for god's sake,NOT
oh look vox made a decent video years ago now it is leftist propaganda,NOT
lol no lie this is hilarious let's see if all this equality talk without common sense and honesty applied has a positive effect in my opinion hell no they boys they have an advantage and all who advocate for these people dont have to compete or take a punch to the face from them,ABU
yes girl you got this!,NOT
i give it a day.,NOT
omg i never expected this you go girl! you'll feel great but don't try to go fully raw the first few days because you'll feel restricted and you'll just crash good luck!!:)))),NOT
wage gap has been debunked over and over,NOT
feminists hate hearing this because they need the wage gap myth to justify their feminism it's their most convenient lie go on feminists keep choosing shit-teir majors and complaining about less women in stem ^),NOT
i really don't understand how everyone can just forget all the nasty shit freelee has said about them and everyone else and just pretend she's cool why is everyone all over her ass all of the sudden trisha shane julien jenna...) and most importantly why are there no shitty conspiracy videos about this seriously though what gives am i missing something?,NOT
it's funny how the news reporter says girls track meet lmao they are boys why are they running with girls.,ABU

just create a transgender race or man up to your true or natural competition...,NOT
5. i feminist can't take facts,NOT
im soooo fuckgn happy,NOT
i'm sorry but that's a guy it freaks me out to hear how people think this is ok one thing is being accepted by society and family but in sports where it is all about physical strength that's different,ABU
so the video is stating that we should go against nature and force farhers to share equal work of care of the child?,NOT
if the wage gap were real same jobs and responsibilities) wouldn't companies would hire an all female staff and save thousands of dollars?,NOT
those k dislikes is just pissed off feminists.,NOT
you're very lucky to live somewhere where you will have lots of options of places to do vegan grocery shopping and go out to eat vegan food i'm so jealous haha i've been vegetarian for almost a year and really want to try to go vegan,NOT
dang a prageru video with a 50: like-to-dislike ratio i never thought i'd see the day well-done!,NOT
omg slowwwww down 😘,NOT
then i identify as a formula one car. using sjw logic i should be allowed to turn up in a f car and compete...,NOT
it's still an indiviual problem if you get less money it's because you earn less it dosen't matter what your gender is,NOT
it's just biology having a kid is a choice a woman must make and yea there are consequences good and bad money isn't everything.,NOT
there is a wage gap........but not in hourly positions as by law they are all equal payed positions however there is a gender and even racial wage gap once you enter into management level there is a gap there but i feel no sympathy for such people as most of america is under the poverty line so even when they are stiffed they still make more a month then most do in three,NOT
now i love you even more yaaas mama save the animals,NOT
greens are the way to go! carbs keep you fuller longer too and cut things out a little at a time or it doesn't last long! so happy this is a thing and i hope you stick to it because you'll feel so much better 🐣,NOT
i respectfully believe there is such a thing as non binary people,NOT
transgenders should compete among themselves.i would like to see a woman who transit as a male compete with males.,ABU
i mean...she also came out as a chicken nugget.,ABU
i make more then the women at my job and it's made clear why on day one when the ship is going down women are the first one to get off and men die.,NOT
how is this an issue in the first place lol?,NOT
trisha i get lady boners around gay men i'm totally a gay male,NOT
i think the power part was misinterpreted i think she mean how the world sees it most folk in rl see any female being more straight forward an well that bitch like the girl who doesn't need help she good all on her own type as too much an not feminine an that's what she mean do she feels like because those traits are more normal an accepted in dudes that she feels more like a dude don't get me wrong she sounds kinda crazy but i think she basically saying she more masculine then she believes to be normal for a girl an feels like she might be trans or some umbrella term like i get her cause i be feeling the same way but i know i'm tomboyish an kinda androgynous so 🏿‍♀️,NOT
why did not she mention pregnancy and raising children are not those the major factors affecting employer's decisions regarding their employees in context of gender?,NOT
the fact that women earn  cents for every dollar that a man makes for the same work is bs however let's look at why women make those choices how dod people perceive a woman who decides to dedicate her life to her job instead of finding a husband and having kids how does society view a women who is willing to be on call at all times she is probably a total b*tch who is going to become an old cat lady with no friends okay so she decides to get married if she works all of the time early in the relationship to try to climb the ladder so she is earning a lot of money people ask why she doesn't spend more time with her husband people ask when she is going to start having children people say things like your biological clock is ticking. not to mention if the woman earns more than the man the man is looked down on by society for not providing for his woman on the other hand if the man works long hours and then takes his woman on lavish vacations and buys her nice things people look at how wonderful of a life the couple have now let's say that the woman decides to have children having any job at all people look down on her shouldn't she be home with the children say she's a lawyer and really values her work but the man is willing to be a stay at home dad or do something with shorter more predictable hours on the side now people are flipping their lid because not only is the man not providing for his family like he should but the kids should have their mother at home with them flip roles and suddenly it is just fine the problem isn't that businesses pay 7 to woman what a man makes but that woman are pressured to sacrifice their career in a way that men aren't that's not to say that you don't have to pick and choose what your priorities are or anything if raising a family is more important than working a high paying job then by all means follow your dreams however that is something that a couple should discuss before starting a family and society should stay out of that families business if the mother wants to be a high earning business professional or a lawyer who works 0 hours/week while the father works from home as a computer programmer so that he can be with the kids great if the father wants to work the long hours and the mother wants to do something more flexible also great if they both want to work hours that are unpredictable and long well they should think of that before starting a family but both parents should be held responsible not just the mother as soon as society buzzes off that's when the wage gap will disappear.,NOT
hasn't she tried to go vegan several times now idgi,NOT
women take on a disproportionate share of child rearing tasks by their own choice this is the thing that all of these analyses ignore people make individual choices about what they want for their own lives and those choices affect how likely they are to get promoted people have different personalities and those differences affect how likely they are to get paid more or get promoted on average women choose to stay home with children more than men on average women are more agreeable when in entry level positions and focus more on relationships rather than quantifiable results these are facts and they predict success in the workplace it is not sexism it is individual choices about work-life balance.,NOT
what is this based vox i'm shook.,NOT
yes spread the message!,NOT

got an ad right before trisha said if she's trans even youtube was like nope you're not doing this! we need a break,NOT
trader joes does the best mushroom and teriyaki sushi just saying  tbf you live in the us so i'm guessing you have a good availability of fruit and veg as well as alternatives as far as milk alternatives go cashew milk is amazing also you can get coconut and soya drinks made from starbucks so frappichinos are still on the menu  you will need other options other than fruit cooked carbs and veg with a nice source there are plenty of low fat tasty sources in the health food section of the supermarket and as for protein there are plenty of meat alternatives or things like beans and lentils can be added into cooked dishes salads soups ect good luck!,NOT
i saw a video of pigs being abused and slaughtered and i couldn't eat meat for months i wasn't even really vegan i just got sick thinking about eating meat crazy.,NOT

gardien chick'n nuggets strips and fishless fillets daiya raised vegetable pizza earth island cheddar and mozzarella cheeze earth balance classic spread vegan butter a great milk replacement is soy milk for an authentic milk tastes or silk almond milks they come in a sweetened version unsweetened vanilla and chocolate many of the cliff bars also do not contain eggs or dairy even the chocolate ship one good for a snack on the go something i love is frying green beans with avocado oil and herb salt toast with avocado on it is a great snack as well order the arbonne vanilla protein shake it's vegan for protein use a blender and mix almond milk banana and arbonne protein for the yummiest shake ever,NOT
u guys need to relax,NOT
i imagine she's upset that vox doesn't pay heras much as the male workers there,NOT
lol i also filmed my response video on the kitchen floor in front of the fridge 🤣 wasn't ready for blaire to be doing that too.,NOT
the gender wage gap is obviously a myth i mean how the hell would companies get away with paying men more for the same work which by the fact is illegal to do and why do i never see any of my most assertive female colleagues at my job complain about it i know a girl at my workplace who is very friendly and all of that but she would never accept to be discriminated like that and would make a very big deal out of it all the time if it actually happened but she seems to love being there and has a great time and she has worked there for at least years.,NOT
so proud eat tons of yummy food you got this:),NOT
progressives purposely leave that information out to push their narrative of the war on women which there is no war on women,NOT
well doesn't that show that the wage gap is not based oh discrimination just job choice and different hours,NOT
women just don't work as hard as men most stay at home and take care of the house or children i don't care if that's sexist it's true,ABU
you're not vegan if your doing it for dietary reasons thats called a plant based diet not vegan vegan is a lifestyle i love you trish make sure to eat lots of beans/nuts for protein and carb up do not be scared of carbs on a plant based diet there healthy carbs and also taco bell has a lot of vegan options just google them. love your vids,NOT
i am a feminist i agree with everything in this video which is why if we want to see women on average earning the same as men on average referring to the opening statistic she cited then we need to encourage women to enter certain fields the top paying majors) what this video did not comment on were the reasons women are choosing not entering these fields if the true costs of a certain career are higher for women than for men then of course we will see unequal gender representation in said field by true costs i am referring to the emotional costs of being the lone women or the of facing constant rude comments can take on a person society has a long history of gender roles and it has been a very difficult process for people to breakdown these notions of women's work versus a man's work. for example if women who want to become petroleum engineers not only have to obtain all the same degrees and experience as their male counterparts but also have to overcome social and emotional obstacles which men face to a much lesser degree because this field is already seen as a natural fit for men then of course women are not choosing to enter those fields because they wage they would earn does not cover all the costs associated with that career thus they way to close the gap between average female and average male earnings is to make adjustments at a societal level on how we work and interact with one another attempting to make each professional field an equally valid option for both genders lastly in references to the idea that there is better pay for employees willing to work longer hours or keep more flexible hours the current trend of women choosing jobs or positions with more traditional working hours can be attributed to the fact that women still take on the majority of housework and child rearing responsibilities so of course they cannot accept positions with irregular or extended hours thus if we want to see women changing the sort of hours they work and thus the level of pay they receive then we need to give men paternity leave and try to equally distribute the burdens or parenthood between the two parents assuming you are lucky enough to have two parents).,NOT
i think thats awesome go for it ),NOT
if you like rice and korean food check out mommytang s channel she is a vegan youtuber and her recipes are healthyyyyyy and yummy and you still feel light and great after eating.,NOT
trisha eats meat hate comments trisha goes vegan hate comments 😂😂,NOT
i am more masculine in my day to day life i like cars i like building things i like to chill with no make up big baggy shirts i like reptiles and bugs i collect skulls but i am a woman! i'm a tomboy.. big deal! people are becoming so confused with their own sexuality and gender because of the fad that being lgbt has become trisha is not trans and turning it into a click bait joke is foul.,NOT
that's so amazing trish  i assume you've probably already seen some of freelee's vids to guide and inspire you a bit on how/what to eat on af vegan diet lost og fruits vegs rice potatoes beans lentils bread pasta etc also there's a lot of fake meats n stuff vegan cheeses plant-milks soy-yogurts etc there's a lot of options if you look around especially in la  good luck love,NOT
not gonna lie i cackled when the video started and blaire was sitting on her kitchen floor ,NOT
this is more like gender-fluid than transgender,NOT
😐you're such a joke,NOT
has she deleted all the speculation comments?,NOT
it's really cool seeing girls supporting each other on the internet this video made me really happy i'm glad trish is on the path 3,NOT
"idk,. she is having heartbreak at the moment from breaking up with that guy it is possible she might binge because she is in an emotional state i know i do eat a lot of whatever when i am sad so please be kind if she goes back to eating meat i don't know but maybe she will continue the vegan thing trial.",NOT
okay so i had a best friend who would talk crap about chick-fil-a and i'm not 000 all about it because i feel bad for the animals but for some reason i felt kinda happy that you like chick-fil-a and i didn't feel alone 😂,NOT
no it is what they did they entered the women's while biologically male cease,ABU
i support trans rights and freedoms but this is discrimination in itself it's so wrong is the trans community okay with this????? wtf,NOT

wow looks like you will have to trash the major of your makeup,NOT
why is this so boring,NOT
this was the most ignorant video i get where you are coming from but you aren't a gay man and you aren't transgender you fit more into the demigirl category.,NOT
based mom is based,NOT
don't forget that in america there is no paid maternity leave and that will prove all feminists wrong.,NOT
race plays an important part as well.,NOT
i think we should all keep in mind that it's also more difficult for women to get into higher paid jobs than it is for men not necessarily for lack of willingness though fewer women seek out certain jobs than men but from labour work to high-paid management positions males are more likely to be chosen by employers out of an equal pool of prospective employees and even sometimes when a woman has greater qualifications it's a similar problem to how fewer african-americans gain employment even when race ratio and education is equal across candidates i don't know if it's just something society will grow out of or if something needs to be done to break the cycle of unequal opportunity/unequal selection here in australia it's not too bad given that state education is easily accessible and puts most kids on equal footing as far as modern education goes but still countless indigenous families can't get their kids the same opportunities because its so much harder for them to get a job due to discrimination there's still a widespread perception of aboriginals as welfare leeches and drug addicts that prevents them from finding work) and in turn their children end up in a similar situation being unable to provide equal opportunity to their own families my point is it's not always choice that creates earnings gaps between different demographics as much as we like to think our freedom-loving first-world countries provide equally abundant opportunities for everyone i just think we need to be mindful of that.,NOT
thank you so much for this film you have raised a new passion for me to continue fighting for veganism,NOT
trisha paytas more like trisha gaytas hahahahahahaha goddem,NOT
you can't change god given dna,NOT

omg trisha im so proud of you😊😊,NOT
as much as i think her a trolling is kinda funny some of the shit she says can have very negative effects.,NOT
vox back it again with the propaganda,NOT
women have more rights then men and they scream oppression! they get away with so much more ik men r idiots but a women could hit a man and they won't get punished for it but if a guy hits a women they get put in jail for assault just bc men r stronger doesn't mean we're all misogynistic and we always beat women up and rape them men get raped it doesn't happen very often but it happens the problem with feminists is that they accuse all men of being assholes and we're f**king not my sister says all guys want the same thing and that is not true at all,NOT
this warms my heart also i like that you linked to gary yourofsky's speech or months ago you posted it and that's a big part of why i went vegan in december i've been vegetarian since i was  but i was eating a cream pie at the time of the video and i remember just thinking this isn't worth it i can give this up. thank you freelee for everything!,NOT
instead of buying cut packaged fruit buy the whole fruit and eat as much as you want just no oil and you should start losing weight  also get wayyyyy more food once you think you have enough you probably don't get more!!!! the more the marrier,NOT

like in days she's going to be doing a kfc mukbang,ABU
i love how she is pretending to react to a video that she paid trisha to make!,NOT
jesus these comments are a mess the video is implying that the primary solution lies in incentivizing businesses to give more flexible working hours which is something that can narrow the earnings gap and potentially be better for everyone you don't have to be a diehard feminist to see the logic here in the standard household where women work but also take on a bit more responsibility for childcare the option of say a - shift for mothers means that they can better align their working schedule with childcare it also gives more flexibility to work ot.,NOT

the stupidity is too high with this wage gap  stop calling it a wage gap.. because it was never about wages it was about earnings  then add more truth to it and specify median yearly earnings gap that way we can understand what the hell we are actually talking about  then you look at the worked hours per year.. and you will see the same gap.. surprise not because it is totally illegal and economically stupid to pay different amounts to different people doing the same work  and in the end you can simplify to median worked hours gap so to summarize the false male hating feminist narrative of wage gap it is in reality a simple median worked hours gap and we can all go to rest knowing that men work more therefore earn more and we can also focus on what is important if we actually care about the gap.. to allow women work more hours but because we all know that feminists and libtards never ever cared about the real issue and they are all in for male bashing.. they will continue to use the debunked false wage gap narrative... i can bet you 00 that years from now i will open a leftist feminist website and i will read another stupid male hating gender wage gap article that paints all women as victims and all men as predators.. because why the hell not?,ABU

thank you for pointing out that even if she's trolling she's actually speaking and acting the way many many people do earnestly i can't remember that little creature that was riley dennis's friend but she popped to mind so many girls act like this and as someone who used to read a lot of yaoi comics online a lot of the female creators transitioned.. simply because they fetishized gay guys it's actually a thing that happens but some of them end up doing the whole testosterone thing which is really unhealthy and then detransition huge waste of time and resources also thank you for not claiming to actually be a real girl other trans people i watched try to claim this that they were real men despite being born women and trisha was not like honey why did you have to transition then i love you and your channel because you don't deny the reality of your birth and existence and i think that makes you happier in your own way than other trans people who cannot accept the reality of their situations.,NOT
tbh i don't think veganism is going to change the world to a better place it feels as though veganism ideology to save animals are artificial,NOT

"nonono you cannot eat as much as you want, when you have the mindset of wanting to lose weight calories in vs calories out you need to be in a calorie deficit in order to lose weight eating food will not make you lose weight no matter what any miracle website out there tells you find out what your maintenance calories are the calories required to stay at your current weight and then eat under that there are ,50 calories in one pound so as long as your total caloric deficit per week is around there you will drop a pound per week which is healthy) also do not let these hclf people tell you avoid fat no fat. you need fats in order to absorb certain vitamins and it aids in protein synthesis which helps build tissue produce cells) make sure you're doing this in a healthy manner do more research and find out what it is that you need to do i weight lift on a higher carb vegan diet 60-70 of my calories comes from carbs and it works for me so i can tell you that doing the lifestyle right will produce great results that you can stick to but if you do this completely blind you're gonna end up hitting a wall because someone turned you onto a vegan fad diet understand what macro and micronutrients are what they do to your body and how they work in sync with others make sure you're getting what your body needs depriving yourself will put your body at great risk) understand calories in vs out etc etc just be smart about this and it will work trish good luck 3",NOT

i can't seem to find the citations for this video could someone point me towards them?,NOT
men get more money cuz women expect them to pay for dinner,NOT
i was thinking the same thing like why can't an experiment be done where men and women work the exact same job and hours do the exact same things in the workrelated area for a month or so then compare wages without the employer being aware of the experiment) and then see it they got the same amount of money or not if there is a difference between their wages then something is up otherwise the wage gap isn't a sexist thing,NOT

so why is it that both of my parents work at the same job both came in at the same week and my dad got more that's weird when you compare it to the video hmmmmmmmmm,NOT
why is there a wage gap at all simple women make decisions that man cannot do women get pregnant men don't so they can continue to work unimpeded for the next months even if they don't get pregnant women overall have more health concerns that take them away from work and another reason men make more is because various jobs often tend to use money to incentivize people to take them it's why men dominate the careers that tend to expose oneself to unsanitary filthy disgusting conditions the most dangerous jobs in the nation are overwhelmingly male.,NOT
individuals tend make the same wages for the same jobs regardless of gender who cares about averages they don't matter and the idiot masses don't know how to interpret them now stop lowering my earning potential all you've done is kept us all equally poor just ask around everyone in every business is paid the same crummy wages unless you're a friend of the family who owns the place.,NOT
thankkk you for touching on her saying she feels black  over her dumbass lol ,ABU
please don't make vegan videos just watch others because there is too much videos on vegans,NOT
i don't really see the problem you've proven that the wage gap or earning gap which is a more accurate name is just a natural thing which happen in a free society were people make their own decisions and different choices have different consequences why should we change how different jobs works that would require the government stepping in and changing things and that's sounds to much like communism or big government.,NOT

hey white i've followed you for awhile now love your channel i am a registered nurse canadian could not have agreed with you calvin rose of dawn more about the jy ludicrousness was literally yelling them when they were live on your channel because most of what they've said done is just beyond bizarre creepy disgusting they said soooo many untruths! we have a phenomenal man by the name of lucas silveira who is a singer/songwriter has been a trans activist looooong before trans was even really known about he has a youtube channel a mom to sons my youngest who has severe autism my oldest who is gay his significant other is a trans man both professionally but even more so personally no hate towards trish but the moment she opened her mouth the beginning of her video it was overtly obvious that she does not even have the slightest clue about what it is to be transgender so sad when someone thinks they're being so intelligent so knowing when the audience can see right through all of it what it's really all about something i liken to the story of the emperor's new clothes” except in trish's case everyone saw right through alllll of her bs love your channel love you if this is ever something you do would love to have you on my live podcast/digital radio show sometime 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,NOT

"hey trish dietary pointers from a vegetarian of years and a vegan of  beans beans_ beans are high in fiber essential proteins other nutrients like iron and amazingly low in calories there are a wide variety of beans the most recognizable probably being chickpeas used in hummus and kidney beans despite having a poorer stigma kidney beans are absolutely delectable prepared right i actually have images of kidney bean tacos on my ig l3ehind  anyway be sure to explore the beans there is inevitably going to be at least one that you find enjoyable nuts though high in calories nuts supply essential fatty acids walnuts are known to boost neuron activity in the brain for example pasta eat pasta pasta is extremely high in protein and caloric it is a grain of course buying a pasta with the least amount of ingredients displayed on the side is recommended the simpler the healthier) will facilitate finding a dairy-free product as well also a note gluten-free pasta is actually calorically lighter than regular pasta i don't require gluten-free products but i enjoy the taste of gluten-free pasta for dairy free cheese products and the like look at brands like earth balance daiya and all the others search dairy free cheeses and dairy free milks on google there's a wide array of milks for example all differing in taste and consistency soy milk almond milk cashew milk pea milk hazelnut milk oat milk flax milk rice milk hemp milk etc commercial sweets i know of to be coincidentally vegan are vanilla oreos nutter butters etc look that up too- mainstream vegan sweets products or even vegan junk food"" obviously best in moderation most chips are vegan.",NOT

i feel this new vegan movement is going to save lives praise god but many people do not have the option or privilege of following a healthy vegan lifestyle emphasis on healthy) until our culture rejects the religion of consumption i don't think veganism can be sustainable or safe for anyone who is not privileged this lifestyle requires us to do our research look for whole food plant sources of many nutrients and monitor our nutrient intake with bloodwork for b-1 among other things) and then make the time to re-learn how to prepare our own food not everyone has access to the time resources or even cognitive functioning to take on this lifestyle in a healthy way i've only been vegan for a year and half and acknowledge it as a privilege i pray that i do not lose access to healthy whole foods but there is no guarantee.,NOT
who's not a vegan here,NOT
i highly suggest going vegan for at least a month because for the first couple weeks your body goes through a detox because it's not used to the amount of fiber and if you ever feel like giving in to the standard american diet just remind yourself what made you go vegan i recommend to just keep looking into the horrors of animal agriculture and how it affects not only the animals but our planet because that is such a big issue and if you keep that in mind the benefits or the mind and body just come along with it.,NOT

censored reality is how people are kept in ignorance individuals become vegan because they are exposed to the truth and by seeing uncensored reality paul mccartney said it all those years ago if slaughterhouses had glass walls... it is sad to see plant based news filter out reality by blurring the horrible truth of carnivores eating animals let the truth speak for itself let's make those brick walls into transparent glass.,NOT

this conveniently leaves off how men often are demanded of higher hours more risks more time away from family etc the parts where you complain about woman taking more household roles and losing hours tends to be where the men of the family pick up extra hours and more responsibility at work the messed up part is often time woman expect men to do this in families so the men start making way more than the woman and then when there is an apparent pay gap this kind of video gets made saying oh the poor woman are getting paid less! complain all you want it's just simple woman do less and get paid less and men are being worked to death for that higher pay maybe sometime vox should do something about how men are getting shafted by this trend too,NOT

the video i've been waiting for😍,NOT
trish this is so great!! i myself come from a very eating-disordered past.. for years i alternated between extreme starvation and hardcore binge eating.. which eventually just turned to binge eating all the time food became the central part of my life my entire life was planned around food and once i would binge it would be like oh well i guess that was the whole point of today anything else i do today is pointless may as well just go to bed. this all changed when i went vegan here are my tips  eat as many whole foods as you can if a fruit smoothie isn't satisfying enough for you in the morning add lots of hemp seeds and almond/cashew butter and chia seeds those will give you healthy fats and fiber increase your calorie intake and just make you feel fuller and give you a better start to your day another important ingredient for smoothies for increased energy and nutrition maca powder it makes your smoothie taste like fucking malt balls mmmm  stock up on emergency foods that are high in calories and easy to make or don't require any preparation at all) like frozen burgers burritos pizzas but also just nuts and seeds these will be your best friend when you don't have time and you need to eat something it's good to snack on nuts or dried fruit throughout the day to keep yourself from getting hungry later in the day and then bingeing on something terrible  try to throw as many greens into your food as possible you will eventually grow to crave them and this is coming from someone who was obsessed with bacon and cheese and was disgusted with vegetables lol i now crave spinach arugula and kale we humans are creatures of habit you can literally train yourself to crave healthy foods even if you can't stop eating the bad ones lol. it's best to sneak greens into a fruit smoothie especially one with really sweet fruits like mango or pineapple because then you can't even taste them  just google things like easy vegan recipes or vegan comfort food and bookmark a bunch of them for future reference get earth balance vegan mac cheese but when you prepare it with a plant milk of your choice earth balance vegan butter although it's fine without the butter honestly) add like tablespoons of nutritional yeast you can get it at whole foods for an extra cheesy flavor also look up recipes for tempeh bacon you can make bacon mac cheese with that shit soooo good there are so many great products out there obviously the best healthiest way to eat vegan especially for weight loss is to stick to eating as many whole foods as you can make everything from scratch etc for instance if you have a good blender you can make your own mac cheese from soaked raw unsalted cashews and sweet potatoes and nutritional yeast and lots of spices or alfredo from soaked cashews and cauliflower and nutritional yeast).. but there are so many great products to buy and keep in your freezer it's good to have them on hand for when you have no time and you're craving something savory and meaty. if you don't have those products as a back-up you might end up bingeing on something non-vegan and then feeling shitty about yourself although with all the vegan options at taco bell chipotle various pizza places wendy's etc you can still get tasty vegan fast food! try beyond meat and field roast meat alternatives they're so fucking good there are amazing nuggets at whole foods in the frozen food section i think they're by that whole foods brand 6 or whatever it's called take it from me a person who used to binge like crazy and was only happy when i could eat tons of bacon and cheese and pasta with cream sauce and burgers and steaks i couldn't imagine going vegan until i watched a few documentaries and freelee's videos too and decided to just fucking go for it it saved my life and now i don't even eat that healthy all the time i like meat alternatives i like frying stuff in oil etc) but i'm still thin and looking good and i don't exercise) even when i smoke pot and binge which happens often lol) my weight stays the same because it's all plant foods rich in fiber good luck!! you can do it!! 3,NOT
my day was just made!!!! yay trish! seek other vegans like joey for ideas i watched lots of freelee videos on what to eat i read a lot about veganism went to vegan restaurants bought vegan cookbooks the more you know the easier it'll be to transition from diet to lifestyle good luck ️,NOT
i enjoyed the video and i'm not trying to be provocative but i have sincere remarks/questions individual choices happen in a context saying that men are more able than women to work longer hours or be on call doesn't take into account power relationships or cultural backgrounds eg i have a female friend who was offered a big promotion at he accountant's office she almost didn't take it because it meant she wouldn't be able to be home for diner and she was afraid her husband wouldn't be able to cook and take care of the kids as it turned out he wasn't and she wakes up earlier every morning to cook dinner so that he just has to warm it up) in this case if she had refused the job i totally agree that it would be absurd to say that the company was sexist but it seems as absurd to completely discard any type of sexism in the choices that some women make how can we interpret the correlation between feminization of an occupation and lower wages in europe  years ago most medical doctors and academics were male now it's shifting over and there are many more females in these occupations at the same time we notice that global wages for both men and women are in average 0 lower than what they used to be in those fields do you think it is merely a coincidence?,NOT
gotta say chick-fil-a has some of the best lemonade ever.,NOT

great film thank you for sharing this i am not a big fan of the vegan label but i technically i am one so i love the film's message i prefer the wfpb approach which pritikin mcdougall greger campbell esselstyn promote so while i wouldn't eat a vegan sausage roll i like that no animals were harmed in its making!!,NOT
thank you my social studies teachers has been preaching lies about the gender wage gap and we've been expected to learn it as truth i've been looking for a very professional video to explain this to her thank you this is perfect.,NOT

measure a women's hours pay per hour and effort into the work then give the male the same job for the same hours and a similar attitude and effort into work that's how a good study could be performed two similar individuals of opposite sex.,NOT
"""two transgendered girls. bahahahaha ')",NOT
hey i have a diagnosis for you pathological liar.,ABU
they should compete against other trans gendered people it's ridiculous competing against girls when they obviously have more testosterone which increases muscle mass,ABU
in a nutshell it's a canadian women vs american man because american dollar=0.7 canadian dollar,NOT
oreos are vegan honey is not vegan!,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap it doesn't exist if you count the number of hours women on average work it narrows to roughly 8 if you take into account the different careers women choose it narrows down to 2 if you consider how women are less likely to ask for a promotion from their boss it narrows to 00% or even in some cases 07%,NOT
have we lost our minds it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that boys are bigger stronger and faster than girls if an  year old male high school senior identifies himself as a  year old boy does that mean he gets to play baseball and football against them?,NOT
cant belive that jason hit that and kiss that😥,NOT
she just ate chicken on her snapchat yesterday lol i guess being vegan for two weeks sucked.,NOT
well explained and well produced.,NOT
transgender people have dysphoria if you do not have disphoria then you are not trans and dismorphia and dysphoria are two very different things you can be a masculine female without being trans you can be a feminine man without being trans trish please talk to people who are trans legit people who are trans because i know you are hurting so many people because you are calling yourself trans when you arent.,NOT

plant based nutrition is the way forward it is always hard to change people who have eaten meat and milk products all their lives my neighbour just died of cancer i have suffered a stroke people just are still ignorant of the causes of their problems and that diet change is the solution.,NOT
damn the script comes in clutch now i can just copy and paste my comebacks lol,NOT
yay trisha!! finally! i recommend vega protein powder use almond milk i also love this app called yummly you can look up vegan recipes i like morning star or gardein for like little snacks through out the day or for dinner i also recommend yoplait yogurts because they do offer you calcium and protein or you can eat mixed nuts or dried fruit because those will also offer you protein garbanzo beans quinoa and couscous are awesome sides to have for any meal because they are super high in protein and for me i eat tofu quite often bc it's tasteless so you can use any sauce on it and it'll only taste like the sauce but the texture is like scrambled eggs it's super easy once you get the taste of all the awesome vegan foods you won't want to go back to eating meet ,NOT
ummm.. yeah the majority of crushes i have st sebastian frodo antinous aka the holy trinity of hotness are at least somewhat associated with being gay especially antinous so according to trisha's logic.. i guess i should start identifying as a 4/ drag queen now in all seriousness.. god bless everyone online and irl who are willing to put up with all my classical curly-haired man-loving crazy anyways off from that tangent.. keep up the awesome work blaire white you're gorgeous funny intelligent and very entertaining to watch!,NOT
i constantly get crushes on straight girls guess i'm a straight man.,NOT
if u switch to vegetarian try morning star farm products they are delicious :,NOT
hi i don't wanna offend you in anyway i love you and support you but and i understand what your going through i'm confused about my gender but maybe instead of saying your ftm or transgender maybe start with genderfulid like he/him/they/them that's what i go by it's mainly because that fact  i believe you have breast implants or whatever  you show them off and ect like that a lot i'm a femine male but i hate wearing skirts dresses bras i actually don't own a bra now i only have a binder and sports bras i love make up and dressing up i cosplay a lot and cosplay girls but i very rarely show off my cleavage i did it for a cosplay once and it made me extremely uncomfortable and i struggle comin out so i'd say be slow with it say your genderfulid and then if you really want to transition like top surgery testosterone ect ect i don't mean it offend you in anyway as i say as i'm confused about my gender but still support you no matter what gender you are ),NOT
yeah literally what the fuck is trisha saying,ABU
finally some common sense.,NOT
bet she won't keep to it,NOT
" is claiming social asylum by saying i dont need to transition to identify as trans"" the trans community is fiercely protective of one another because of the adversity they face every day she is using the plight of so many others for monetary gain nothing more trash",ABU
i've been vegetarian for six months and dairy free for one month and now i have officially gone vegan and its been about a week im so happy!!!,NOT

isn't it illegal to pay women less than men ,NOT
 i just wanted to get this out i honestly just wanted to thank you for spreading the vegan message the way you do and for being so passionate about it i came to this lifestyle from an awful eating disorder and spent hours and hours every day just watching all of your videos and lily's from legit nutrition hawaii i can honestly say that this lifestyle saved my life i know i'm in the very early stages right now and it's still new for me but i have never felt so good mentally and soon to be physically anorexia/bulimia recovery is honestly the hardest thing i've ever done and there are so many things going on with my body right now but i know that it is the best decision i've ever made i was wondering if you could make a video and touch on this a bit more i know you have a few videos that talk a bit about it but maybe you could go a bit more in depth like this severe pitting edema and maybe what i can to to relieve pain if not that's ok thank you so much for everything!,NOT
what about the homeless bias women are much less homeless than men i think you should cover this.,NOT
trisha is the embodiment of r/notlikeothergirls,NOT

i do hope trish can stick to it even though it seems she was doing it so she could lose weight for the new video she just released one crying about her and sean's break up so it might be comfort food getting her through right now i hope she stays strong i think her going vegan will help with her moods as well because the healthier one is the happier one will be.,NOT

giiiiiiirrrrlll you've lost ittttttt 🤣🤣,NOT
all of the feminists saying that there is a gender wage gap then proceeding to tell you that gender is a social construct.,NOT
the salary gap is affected by the choices of individuals so we must ask ourselfs what is driving each sex towards specific career paths i´m not satisfied with the simple awnser that the gender gap just cant be explain and that it simply is there are various factors that can be properly studied social standars/cultural customs companies and countries policies.. so maybe in order to explain what drieves people to make certain decitions we have to look at they´re surroundings and see if there is were the problem lies.,NOT
but still women ceos get lesser salary than male ceos lol.,NOT
i bet those 7 people got triggerd.,NOT
loving trish's new blinged out nails 🏾💅 i wonder if trish will get dragged for this there's ppl that are actually transgendered lol this just seems like a scream for attention trish is a female that sometimes doesn't like to glam each day no need for the extra stupid labels trish always looks for something random to bring up lol smh,NOT

my husband recently went vegan about a month ago i went more vegetarian my first shopping trip i couldn't help but laugh at myself because of how much fake meat i bought i definitely am not used to cutting out meat yet but i haven't had any real meet in a few weeks i take pictures of all the products i buy and put it on my instagram so i can track what things i actually like when i go shopping again gardein and daiya are two of my favorite brands so far.,NOT

i was forced to write a paper on this topic last year for school i received a failing grade because she said the facts that i found and used didn't match her opinion.,NOT
this makes so much sense feminists must have really low iq's to not know this or they're just ignorant,NOT
are we in the twilight zone ,NOT
i am sure she is particially right but i assume gender gap is due to sexism too lol she is probably chosen to deliver this message for sexist reasons.,NOT
have fun with it trisha find what you like and try new things  happy for you!!,NOT
she's trolling just to get clout and it's sad.. imagine your channel dying so you have to say your trans pathetic.,NOT
"ok i'm vegan so here are some tips  make sure to eat enough calories because what you have there isn't enough  you can get vegan burgers or vegan meat and it's really good amy's is a really good brand and their vegan mac and cheese and burritos are amazing  most of the time ingredients lists will say contains soy milk wheat etc at the bottom so look at that  look into the different meat egg and dairy ingredients  trader joe's has amazing vegan options they have really good dark chocolate and meat""  look up vegan versions of your favorite food i really like pancakes so i looked up vegan pancakes and they are by far the best pancakes i have ever tried lastly a vegan diet is a very nice amazing diet if you eat enough calories you won't be hungry at all you have a sufficient amount of protein on a vegan diet and you also learn a lot more on how to keep your body healthy and strong if you don't want to quit completely on animal products do it a little slower i went vegetarian for months and then vegan for a week then back to vegetarian the finally to a fully vegan lifestyle i hope you enjoy your vegan journey and make sure to keep all of us updated xoxo lexi",NOT
"the gender wage gap is described as the relationship between men and womens pay it is said that women are getting paid roughly  cents to the dollar that every man makes the wage gap is calculated by taking the average amount full time men and women make and dividing them by each other to get the difference in regards to womens soccer from the article pay disparity in u.s soccer?"" there seems to be a pretty large pay difference between the players however there is also a benefit difference for instance women get a salary and possible bonuses along with health benefits and maternity leave whereas men do not reap these benefits but i would assume the article did not include mens salary they make more if they play often i chose to watch the video there is no gender wage gap"" and i do agree with some of the points that she brings up for instance she spoke about choices that men versus women might make that add to the variables of the pay they earn womens often choose jobs that are not considered to be the most high paying.personally i do agree with some aspects that she brings in the video i chose to go to school to become an elementary school teacher i could have chosen a route with a much higher pay but i enjoy working with children and love the classroom environment being a school teacher i would be able to have summers and holidays off i believe it would be a profession where i could also raise a family without having to pay thousands of dollars for childcare.",NOT
these comments are disgusting you intolerant bastards should all be ashamed of yourselves they probably already deal with enough bs from karens who are mad their daughters can't beat them they don't need some internet degenerates to tell them off and insult them get a life!,ABU

"when evidence contradicts your theory your theory is wrong as the video acknowledges there is a pay gap an australian study of over ,00 occupations showed that women earn more than men in only one high-paying job in australia and that women only out earned men in jobs that were low paid anyway data from australian tax office) as the australian study found there is no such thing as a job where women are taking home large pay packets but men are not” the median income for jobs favouring men was up to eleven times higher than the median income for jobs favouring women and it does make a fundamentally flawed assumption that corporations do the hiring they dont individual managers make hiring decisions and rarely are their incentives aligned with corporate objectives a corporation may claim equality but individual managers have to handle staff absences when women are off having children consciously and sub consciously there is an incentive to hire and promote men and thus pay women less to discourage them from accepting a role the final flawed logic is that we cant explain why there is a discrepancy therefore we cant claim that there is one” the claim was that women were paid less and the data shows that this is true whether or not one can explain the reason if police used that logic they would never investigate murders because they cant explain how it happened therefore they cant be certain that it did happen",NOT

they should give medals to rd th and th place it's cruel for women sport to allow it those transgender girls are taking drug enhancements to allow them to race in a competing sport which should be drug free,ABU
for a culture change to happen it all starts with woman it's their decision on what job they want it's their decision if they want to stay at home and raise a family no one is forcing any of this on you if you end up with kids but don't want to quit working then don't talk about it to your spouse don't just accept it as oh i'm a woman so he expects me to quit my job no that's a stupid mentally you're just hurting yourself with a mind like that of course there are jobs out there that will prove too difficult for woman and that's just how our bodies were made men have more muscles than woman and their body structure helps with hard jobs but if you want that job too ladies you can although some might say it's easier for men to grow in strength doesn't mean woman can't either.,NOT

trisha i'm so proud of you you got this you should check out hot for food on youtube!,NOT
trisha just needs some trans folks to help them figure out what they're feeling and put that into society's labels and proper vocabulary if they're gonna give an explanation to the world if you're trans and you hate when ppl misgender you or treat you the wrong way just bc you don't pass well or you just started your trans journey don't do that to others ofc this video is a mistake and makes no sense but that's also how trisha usually make videos lmao just chill and wait till some time passes and they get more information and education so they can talk properly about they feelings.,NOT
yay!!!!!frelee the bananna girl will be so happy,NOT
this addition of transgender women who were born male in these competitions is unfair men have more fast-twitch muscle fibers as well as longer arms bigger hands denser bones men have a larger percentage of hemoglobin in the blood men have greater aerobic capacity and greater capacity to transport oxygen in the blood males and females have completely different bone structures males have larger hearts lungs arteries veins tendons etc no amount of hormone treatment can neutralize all of these differences i support trans people's rights to be free of discrimination but biological males should not be allowed to compete against women in athletic competitions.,ABU
feminists will never give up the  cent myth they realize that it is their greatest weapon feminists argue that women are under-represented in upper-class fields but it certainly isn't due to discrimination. 9% of all colleges have affirmative action policies that favor women and discriminate against men.,ABU
conclusion there is not a wage gap there is an earnings and field access gap based heavily on hours flexibility with perhaps some employer bias based on the type of worker they're looking for solution there is no direct solution plenty of things to help broadly though most of which involve innovation and an improved situation for all workers.,NOT
you need to pick up potatoes and rice!!!!!!,NOT

i really dislike when people say they're going to do something and then not do it girl your snap just had fried chicken and waffles of course you're not going to upload that on youtube because people are going to hold you accountable and i find it hard to believe you don't have a problem with it you were never going vegan you were trying to go plant based you obviously don't care about animals or anything really unsubscribing.,NOT

there is a girl in my school who claims to be feminist she always brings up the wage gap and how it is wrong when we were having a debate in class i brought up all the points i learned in this video and she didn't care she is too hypnotized into believing what she wants to believe that she can't even think about the idea of there not being a wage gap after instantly shutting me down before i could finish talking she went on to say that everyone deserves equal pay and free speech...,NOT
even if she's trolling that honestly makes it worse she has no issue making the lgbt community look like a bunch of confused attention seeker psychos just so she can get some attention she claims to care about lgbt rights but has no issue pulling this stunt that gives them more bad rep.,NOT

personally this hurts my family my mom is in a great job the thing is she's a single mother and she raises me and my younger sister if we had a father more money would be rolling in and as my sister and i get older we also need more money only having one woman bringing in money for all three of us let alone our bills we also have a decently sized story house) doesn't sustain us enough and sometimes results in money being tight this is an issue for all women of all aspects many women work just as hard or even harder i hope i can grow up to work in an age where i can receive equal pay for the work i'm doing compared to a man.,NOT
i just don't understand how they could be proof of this i just don't think it's fair.,NOT
i eat lots of bread pasta and rice and curry and sandwhiches,NOT
huge respect trish 💚💚💚💚,NOT
so she blatantly ignores the fact that not all of those were choices maybe some of the woman in lower paying jobs wanted something that paid more but were rejected because they were female maybe sexism lies more in the people with the duty of hiring rather than the people who give out wages.,NOT
when i got the notification i thought she was just trolling.,NOT
props to her if she's actually trans but if she's doing it for clout then she looks desperate this is coming from an actual transgender person.,NOT
i think some people need to chill trisha is doing something huge by trying out a vegan diet for weeks it's a great way to start at the end of two weeks she'll feel so much better than she does now and if she isn't full on vegan after those two weeks i'm willing to bet she'll eat more plant based which is still more moral we'll see what happens!,NOT
someone please help her sons school or on the lgbtqia plus someone just help her because i go spend my time with this dumbass how you go from saying you're a girly girl fake nails fake tits but then you say oh no honey i'm a man bitch where,ABU
i showed my feminist friend this and now i'm a racist bigot got it totally makes sense,NOT
there most definitely is a wage gap between men and women about two thirds of the gap is due to uneven distribution among various occupations and differences in skills and experience while the last third cannot be explained and has been attributed to discrimination in the work force the discrimination can be explained by the glass ceiling which is the seemingly invisible barrier hindering advancement of women and minorities in a male-dominated organization clayton 14) works cited clayton gary e economics principles practices new york ny glencoe/mcgraw-hill 005.,NOT

this video is old lol she already quit being vegan watch her recent vlogs and snapchat,NOT
luv you blaire 😻😻,NOT
the biggest argument for there not being a pay gap is the equal pay act of 96 which made it illegal to discriminate against women's pay every year there is an average of 00 law suits over the violation of this law roughly  percent win that's 5 people a year can actually prove that they were discriminated against in the workplace that's mind bogglingly few people.,NOT

it's so amazing that you are going vegan but note that all the fruit that you are eating does still have tons of sugar in it it is amazing for you and way better than candy but if you don't work it off it will store as fat so along with this diet that freelee has she also must work out and go on walks and bike rides to keep it off remember that you can have everything you loved before as a vegan you can still eat waffles that are vegan my fave and almond milk lattes are bomb side not oreos are vegan so if you really need something processed go ahead and eat them oreos haha just know that there is literally a vegan version of everything.. almond milk soy milk coconut milk vegan eggs vegan meat vegan waffles vegan burgers and vegan sandwiches yesssss so you can still have amazing goodies as being a vegan remember to get vegetables),NOT

why focus on the jobs and not the lack of male parenting?,NOT
watch that vegan couple,NOT
if you take all of the money earned by women and compare it to all of the money earned by men you will arrive at the conclusion that women earn 77 of the money that men earn once you factor in for educational choices women tend to choose socially oriented fields while men still overwhelmingly make up those who choose stem fields career investment women tend to time more time away from their career to raise families and time spent working men tend to work more overtime than women do that gap narrows to nil want to make a ton of money choose a stem degree work  hours a week for 0-4 years and never get pregnant.,NOT
blame feminists and sjws and obama they did this to you and geuss what this is the equality ladies were looking for so when it doesn't go your way it's unfair i geuss that equality talk is demolished.,ABU
female body builders still wear super effeminate clothing and makeup even though people would say not me to be clear they look like men top beauty gurus and makeup artists out here are men......... we're at the precipice of stopping conformity purely by gender/sexuality and then trisha has to sit on her kitchen floor and talk a load on nonsense because she can't be bothered to take her money and go see a therapist to work all that out.,ABU
this is a good video it takes into account that men are able to give more to a job because they traditionally have less responsibilities and indicates that women in the position to do the same equal close to the same amount a statistic glossed over quite often i have one contention however the video states that the concept of the wage gap is based on the difference in median income yet what most people actually say and believe is the following women make  cents on the dollar a man makes for the same job. which is very different statement that indicates intentional oppression by employers.,NOT
i've been vegan months i will never go back to consuming animal products.,NOT
liberal media supporting them again....,NOT
wooooow.. gigi's face is so masculine...,NOT
so i'm not hating i've been watching t since i could remember but i really do not understand this i have multiple friends that are trans they want to be fully the gender they feel as they are they will go to any length to be a guy or girl whoever they are t has went through so many surgeries to get bigger breasts or an ass or a flatter stomach it's all to give a girlish appearance i've never had a friend who had purposely made themselves look at opposite gender especially having money they had always tried to achieve to make themselves feel they when they do on the inside out.,NOT
this is actually an interesting conversation on gender just because she doesn't have all the correct words doesn't make it crazy,NOT

women have been entering what were exclusuvely male spaces for years now the stiletto heel is on the other foot🤣🤣 and they are complaining whatever happened to women can do anything a man can do you should be able to compete against a trans female be careful of what you wish for!,NOT
she's tooooolin'!! she does this all the time to get people talking about her obviously it works she actually said in the past that that's what she does.,NOT
feminists say women get paid less while still hiring men because the patriarchial good boy club twisting their curling mustaches smoking their cigars and wearing top hats shined with female tears conspire to make sure women die on the job  of the time pay alimony  of the time get a 0 sentencing discount and get custody 4 of the time oh wait...,NOT
they forgot that men work longer hours take less holidays and that 9/10 work deaths are men because men go into high risk work high reward oil rigs tree surgeons etc....,NOT
lying with pictures example :20 the gap doesn't go from  to . cents it goes from  to . cents why do they do that don't they have a strong case anyway?,NOT

sweetheart if you want to lose weight fast just pack in the protein baby try this if the vegan thing doesn't work out eat lil carbs and high high protein  shakes a day boiled eggs mozzarella cheese and greek yogurt fast makes you full and easy!!!!!,NOT
a transgender male is not a female it is wrong to allow them to compete with females if they have male bodies it's not fair to the actual females they are being cheated.,ABU
people who are trans in these comments are saying your not trans this is offensive like if your for loving who you want to love and being who you want to be why are you telling her what she is or isn't she can't help the way she feels if someone told you you weren't trans i bet you'd be pissed,NOT

argh that vocal fry is unbearable!,NOT
ugh yes we know this already it's the reason why this happens we are trying to solve i think that it has to do with the facts that what is considered normal/typical jobs for men and women and what is considered normal comes from the old gender strereotypes that lead us it's easier to be normal i'll give an example i'm a woman who's always been interested on woodworks in elementary school i had to decide if i go to sewing classes or woodworking i wanted to go to woodworking but since i was really shy and all my friends went to sewing classes i followed them things like these leads to less experience and makes chances to get to your chosen school/jobs etc worse well thankfully things aren't that bad in my country and i did get into a carpenter school now getting a job is a different story d,NOT

it's also way more complicated then this clearly biased video is showing.,NOT
sad as hell...,NOT
i'm newly vegetarian and going to be making my way into being vegan hopefully within a month some video ideas i would find so helpful is maybe doing an eat this not that video where instead of the classic switching out a high calorie meal for a lower calorie do a classic non vegan meal or food item for a vegan meal/food item also maybe do a video on things that are surprisingly not vegan i never know with some foods thank you!,NOT
i saw one person on an instagram post talking about meds and what they do to your head they said a lot of people they know that took meds were saying strange shit about their sexuality and changing it trisha definitely has metal health problems and is probably on meds i think she is dont quote me on that i'm not defending her but if this is cause by meds then i feel bad for her but i also wanna wait and see if shane literally trishas best friend will say anything about this.,NOT
there's a clever linguistics trick at around :15 she says the wage gap shrinks when we account for choice and then says the remaining .6 is due to choice that doesn't actually logically follow and the fact that such a blatant error made it through scripting performing and editing says that it was likely deliberate.,NOT
just curious about wage differences among genders that hold the exact same position for example in the top paying occupations where males dominated employment were the employed women who held the same positions with the same qualifications education and choices payed the same because that is the only relevant question imo.,NOT
well they are dudes..,ABU
bout to get cancelled lmao,NOT

let the private businesses and company's pay whatever they want if you don't like the pay move on...,NOT
trisha female to male also trisha male to female.😔,NOT
i know this is a weird comparison but i just thought of it when watching this video when spider-man got his powers he said he could never compete in sports with his newfound powers since he wasn't able to compete before basically he knows he would be at an advantage but he still doesn't compete because he knows it would be unfair i dunno this video makes me think of what he said,NOT
so proud of trish i hope it sticks ,NOT
would have been awesome if she freelee went to vegan without a pay off but nonetheless she has committed to trying it guess that's all that matters ,NOT

when a woman leaves the workforce to have children have you factored in that the male has to work extra during that period to try and cover some of the earnings loss?,NOT

what a time to be alive.,NOT
let's close the wage gap white straight men aren't evil,NOT
what this means is that the wage gap is voluntary based on sick american female culture women choose a man and they decide how to spend hours so sick male culture gets involved too misogyny and misandry coexist and as a white male i feel demonized far more than i see women exploited since my birth in1992.,NOT

"probably the definitive book on this is warren farrell's why men earn more* written some four years before this study it identifies  areas where men on average make different decisions than women on average) that is all the points made in this video and more the central insight is that the road to higher pay is a toll road."" higher pay generally means sacrificing something lower-paid people do not why this is so important is that realising the actual reasons for the earnings gap empowers women and men for that matter to make choices to boost their earning potential if that's what they want to do* any given person has of course the right to decide that they don't want to miss their kid's soccer game move to the other side of the country or work in a highly stressful and competitive environment areas of their life other than their paycheck will doubtless benefit it's just a bit silly for anyone regardless of gender to make these choices then turn around and compare their paycheck with another person who decided the money was important enough to them for them to make these and other sacrifices.",NOT

trish you should watch unnatural vegan's videos here on youtube she's got lots of stuff about proper vegan nutrition so you don't quit after a week eat lots of legumes leafy greens nuts seeds fruits and veggies and you'll be fine after sometime you wll need to star using suplements like vitamin b12 but you've got time time to learn more about it again go to unnatural vegan's channel.,NOT
jasons dick must of been that trash made her turn transgender,ABU
thanks obumer for opening the closet door,NOT
grapes are going to bloat you up so are melons and other high water dense fruits because you've been eating crap for so long your guts will not be used to it and you will feel uncomfortable i would recommend trying to eat more cooked vegan foods like rice beans pasta corn potatoes oatmeal and veggies with stuff like sweet chilli sauce etc if your gonna be vegan you need to start trying to eat veggies again you will start to like them after a while you have been hooked on the crack cocaine of food so dont be supprised when normal food tastes bland and boring.,NOT
she also forgot different educations what school they went to grades from that school along with which degree and that there are more men in specific higher paying fields s.t.e.m fields to be more specific so the 7-7 cents yo the dollar become  cents to the dollar and there are more variables that can be taken into account that just aren't one being kids income and how many women who don't work and how many men don't work which can put it in the range of being cents to the exact same payment in all honesty if there is a sexism variable in here it's minute and insignificant because there is a law against it.,NOT
i have noticed that the media outlet websites like the bbc for example that are so keen on drumming the gender wage gap story over over again have disabled/removed the comments section on their so-called news articles why to stop people from being able to rebuff their lies a simple post with a link to this youtube video could educate so many people... but oh no you can't do that you can't tell the truth or even just present the facts the science the logic anymore... that is not allowed these days great video,NOT

there's also the part about the same job the same amount of work the same workplace people will often focus on this especially sjw's yet they dint understand that if this is actually the case then what they're doing has been illegal since 96 when president john f kennedy passed a law that stated that with the exception of raises it is illegal to pay anyone less or more than any other for the same amount of work in the same profession at the same workplace people often miss things like this however in 01 9 women went on trial for this law and approx in were deemed legitimate which still works after adding in false negatives and removing false positives.,NOT

people on the left pushing the wage gap are trying to make the point that if a man and a woman are working the same job that due to sexism companies and corporations will pay the women 3 less than men correct i have points a: who are the companies doing this where are the whistleblowers how could any company get away with a policy like this in 01 and keep everyone silent men and women b: for every job you found where men and women were making the same money in the same position for hours worked etc. you would have to find another where the woman was making 6 less than the man in the same position for hours worked to get 7 right?,NOT
well put but i figured you would have made this a looooong time ago,NOT

so when you account for different choices men and women make it becomes . cents so what about those . cents what's the explanation for that?,NOT
i've always found this complicated attempt at explaining the wage gap through choices and other factors to be pointless the problem is so much simpler comparing medians just isn't a useful metric it's so well-known that it has a name simpson's paradox for all we know women actually get paid more than men for equal work and the effect reverses when taking a median due to this statistical phenomenon tl;dr medians tell us nothing in this situation period no need to explain why the discrepancy appears with choices hours worked college majors etc.,NOT

it's fantastic that you want to try this but please understand that you will not lose weight in weeks from eating this way the only way to lose weight in weeks is to starve yourself bad obviously) a low fat high carb vegan diet with loads of fruit and veggies does work long term health weight etc but you may not see significant weight loss for anywhere from a couple of months to possibly a year or more it took me close to a year to see my body really start to change after that it's so easy to just maintain and keep going please try this long term.,NOT
this seems a lot less opinionated then most of the facts i hear most other feminists rant about.,NOT
try working at the same place for  years and having a man make the same amount as you day  same education same position and same company this is the story of my mother she worked in the same factory since she was 8 it's because of unions you know organizations that are supposed to protect workers just not the ones that actually work.,NOT

misleading in percentage misleading in pay coefficient seriously this is a coeffient you don't do it 0. that means you multiply by 0.1 one simple way-1.5-to .5 not this bullshit) gap is mostly due to men better qualification and women working less-hardworking due to ding ding ding less muscle tissue low-leve jobs here's your gap mam.,ABU

why do people think they can do these little surveys and make a huge and mostly missleading conclusions their are simply too many variables that effect the results in a large way that have not even been concidered in a simple physics expirement that might have  controlled variables you still need to be pretty spot of to get even close to the theoretical values with the practical aspects to really have an accurate surveys you would need to take into account almost everything like qualifications if your comparing something like running a business its even more difficult this is what happens when you teach the socialists statistics.,NOT

is been proven time and time again that men have a physical advantage over women nothing sexist about it that is just plain facts of science and nature i don't care that they have gone through hormone therapy they even said in the video that everybody's body responds differently if there was no advantage what is it just a coincidence that they always finish one and two i think not these parents say that all they care about is their child's well-being very hard to believe they are promoting distructive behavior and mental illness 00%,ABU

you guys make great informative videos.,NOT
i love and respect my sister because she despises femenists,NOT
i'm not the kind of guy to try and force my beliefs upon others so only read if you're interested but i feel like some guys get caught up on this sort of women are being greedy or self-important or just want to criticise men. sort of view and like yes there is a small percent of jerks who will confirm that stereotype but i also think its silly that so many guys act like it is a hit to there pride to acknowledge that there may be some male favouritism going on i really feel like that isn't necessary here is my beliefs at least i want everyone to have an equal shot at things if there seems to be some cultural favouritism or discrepancy in equality that is correctable we should strive for fixing it whether searching for furthered equality helps me or not i will support it because i would hope that others support support me in times that don't benefit them we're all just kicking about on this planet let's not forget we're all the same.,NOT
she totally blew past the fact that the bar graph showed just as high numbers of shared equally vs mothers do more so yes fathers do more only had  but isn't that the goal to have shared equal responsibilities isn't that what the feminists want oh wait that's right though they want it to be men do more work.,NOT
being vegan has literally positively changed my life! it's really great  you can eat as much as you want but still lose weight it's witchcraft  you always feel good because you know that you aren't harming animals  your skin begins glowing and looks much smoother and healthier: i hope that you enjoy the experience but you don't have to eat just fruit eat lots of carbs!!,NOT

stop growing grain stop feeding grain to animals stop eating grain i'm guessing this film is just another propaganda film promoting vegan.,NOT
i'm all for transgender right and fully support their life choices but we have to take a hard look at this biologically men are typically physically stronger than women this being said transgender is not trans-sex even if you go through hormone therapy this isnt about not being pc or descrimination this boils down to biology it's not fair that a transgender woman who is biologically male can compete against biological females it's just not even and it's not fair to these athletes.,NOT
waiting for freelee to make a video of this,NOT
even the incorrectly calculated wage gap is closing fast way more women go to college than men and women are getting married and having kids later and later every year to focus on their careers more the truth is business was extremely unfriendly to women like  years ago and it's been getting progressively better since then one day women will probably make more than guys do the way the education system is going but these things take time they don't happen overnight.,NOT
but some career choices dont allow women to duo certain things and some sexism is actually in school so i go home and i tell my mom that at school that let the boys do fun things like move chairs table but only thing girls can do is file papers so and then she said well the try not to hurt the girls we so we can have children well it's not obligated for a women to have children.,NOT
got a woman to say it so they can't be called sexist good idea.,NOT
why don't you eat vegetables they are healthy and good for you.,NOT
jordan peterson a famous clinical psycologist who recentlty went viral if you don't know who that is) talked about how the small single-digit difference extremely likely has to do with how women statistically tend to be less assertive and more agreeable which consequently results in slightly lower wages and a decrease in raises.,NOT
finally an intelligent video it get many things wrong and miss some things to consider but holy moly finally a feminist video that uses logic instead of feelings thank god vox keep it going,NOT
this video has a point but it doesn't tell the whole story often traditionally female fields are paid less because they are mostly women also women are less likely to ask for a pay raise partially bc they are more likely to be looked on as pushy or aggressive than a man would be it is often harder for women to get to higher level positions that pay more because they aren't viewed as as good leaders and male bosses and even as a few studies have shown other women may discriminate against women when giving promotions many high paying male dominated fields also have problems with sexual harassment silicon valley is a good example which obviously discourages female workers the problem is not companies deliberately paying women less it is that it is harder for women to get into higher paying fields,NOT
basically they are saying leave it up to the men and stay at the house,NOT
i think what we're witnessing is a person slowly slipping into insanity,ABU

we can't use steroids in sport because more testosterone equals a big advantage so taking a dude with reduced👀 testosterone vs women with basically nonexistent testosterone is as much of an advantage as a dude on testosterone steroids racing against non steroid runners it's not about identity it's about being fair to all of the runners you want to be a woman good for you but if you're saying you have no advantage you're disturbed now i'm about as non athletic as a skinny dude can be but back in senior year during that pacer test i got to  laps and only stopped because i was running in vans terrible shoes for running and me feel were hurting the rest of the dudes say for one xxl member of the class got at least  laps while the girls were averaging around  with only four making it past 0 and that's just endurance we're talking about we had a girl who ran track different years who reached  or  and my video game clad self out lasted her there is an advantage to testosterone fellas it's may not be fair but it is indeed a fact but what do i know i'm just your average dude 🏾‍♂️,ABU

the issue is not that women are paid less it's that we value traditionally masculine jobs more than feminine ones teachers nurses and caretakers are seen as less valuable than engineers scientists and other masculine careers ultimately both women and men should have the freedom to choose a career without having to think of preserving their masculinity or femininty we need both men and women in teaching we need both men and women in engineering we need both men and women in the military we just have to work together.,NOT
while i like the idea of reducing wage differences between sexes i'm deeply skeptical of increasing flexibility in many fields of work as flexibility often in practice means that the employee be available when the employer needs them and not that employees enjoy more self-direction it might be true for higher-educated professions but for working class people flexibility can simply be a euphemism for a business conveniently refusing to hire them full time so families have to resort to multiple part-time jobs in order to make ends meet sometimes with short-term contracts and very uncertain employment conditions.,NOT

i love you trish this is a great start but remember if you were on a restrictive diet chances may be you might gain it back to your healthy weight just warning you but when you do eat unhealthily and you start a vegan diet you make feel like shit may have breakouts this is actually just your body cleansing and yes fruits are the best way to lose weight has lots of carbs more than vegetables so keep in mind also don't buy packets of stuff you'll probably just lazy and broke no joke just so to any produce section and buy a whole watermelon cantaloupe ect you definitely get your money's worth!!: again love you and have hope!🍓🍓,NOT
hey! just wanted to say how awesome you are and how much i learn about the trans community through you i had a question about something you said in this video about feeling feminine or masculine is not about gender i 0 percent agree with that statement so my question is as a trans woman what was it that made you realize that you were a female born in a man's body if it wasn't the fact that you felt more feminine than a man im sorry if this question is insensitive i definitely am ignorant to so many things that you and other trans women and men go through.,NOT
