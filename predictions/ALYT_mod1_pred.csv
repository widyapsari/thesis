i will be the one to take loads of insults and thumbs downs on this but prager should not be using such an absolute title for this video their arguments are correct yes the popular  cents per dollar mantra is the result of statistical illiteracy but they are not addressing the fact that a wage gap indeed exists and can be shrunken by some means for example we could encourage women to pursue the hard sciences encourage better wage and salary negotiation and promote better work ethic saying that a small gap exists and is thus irrelevant is nonsense i expect better from prager.,0,0

to be any gender on any day is basically being gender fluid i'm personally gender fluid and i go by he/him they/them pronouns but i don't identify as transgender if anything i acknowledge that sometimes being fluid feels like i'm constantly transitioning because i don't have a fixed gender but i am not trans its just some food for thought but i support you wanting to express your masculinity and whatever way that may be.,0,0

okay trisha you identify as a female you literally said you identify as your natural-born gender which is female shut the fuck up with your transphobic bullshit oh no you had to wear sports bras  bitch shut up that doesn't make you trans at all you're a tomboy you literally have no dysphoria you have your fucking tits out the entire fucking time you have more male characteristics oh you don't wanna be the center of attention that doesnt fucking make you trans girls don't have to wear makeup or do their hair to be a girl i'm a trans guy and i fucking hate this video so much just because you're into gay guys doesn't make you a guy let me say this again you are not a man so many people have opposite sex envy and they aren't trans i'm sure a lot of girls especially ones going through puberty envy men because it'll make their life easier that's not what dysphoria is dysphoria is not opposite sex envy dysphoria is wanting the opposite sex because itll match their gender gender dysphoria is a legitimate mental thing genderfluid doesn't exist some gay men date ftm people and don't have a problem with having sex with them despite their female parts because they don't have gynophobia some gay men do have gynophobia but that's not my point my point is that you are not transgender you are a cisgender female coming from a real trans guy you experience little to no gender dysphoria i apologize for being so rude i'm normally not and i normally try to have a rational and respectful conversation but i'm so pissed at this a lot of people don't like their given name not all of them are trans you really need to get the idea that you're even remotely considering being trans you were happy with short hair because you don't like the responsibility of having long hair most real trans guys want short hair because that's typically masculine masculinity does not equal male femininity does not equal female you can be a feminine boy or a masculine girl your attraction does not have anything to do with your gender/identity unless your attraction to men being ftm but not knowing makes you feel gay or vice versa that would be the only instance that attraction affects identity when you're trans ftm you don't have a male side' because you are male you are not male you are not a gay man seriously don't identify as trans or come out unless you've seen a licensed gender therapist and have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria yes you actually have to be diagnosed in most places you need an official diagnosis to go on hormones or just medically transition in any way but of course you can't medically transition because you'll just develop dysphoria because you're transitioning to something that you think you want/are but really you don't/aren't please spare yourself the time energy hate and dysphoria and shut up get the idea out of your head that you're even remotely trans please.,1,0

"perhaps we should ask why the overwhelming female-filled fields get paid so little in the first place for instance why does our society place so little economic value on education a female dominated field if one studies the history of waged labor the genesis of capitalism and women's roles within that system we see that all of the work that has ever been women's work gets paid less because we think it is worth less sometimes not even paid for at all as is in the case of domestic house work) i am calling upon michel foucault's analysis of 500s europe and the rise of capitalism and waged labor as is talked about in the history of sexuality volume  silvia federici also talks about this in chapter of caliban and the witch women were subjugated into the economic machine as unpaid domestic labor while the work of men was waged this gave men the power to feed and house themselves and their wives while the women had no power of independence from their husbands because they couldn't make money that legacy continues on today in a world where we still feel on some level that women's work should be free prageru's analysis also doesn't mention how women can't just move to other cities because they are tied down by dependent children and other social roles within families that men are not as often entangled in this is another arena of unpaid women's work that is brushed aside and made invisible within the realm of the private sphere as opposed to the waged public sphere within which men more often work and of course there is the well known fact that stem areas are not always welcoming spaces to women and in fact can be quite hostile do we all remember the google employee who argued that women are biologically less capable of stem work than men a video that prageru itself also produced and distributed the hypocrisy!) and can we not recognize the role of generalized misogyny in all of this as well being a woman entails being in a world where you are constantly sexualized from the time you hit puberty perhaps even earlier most women recount the first time that they were sexually hit upon by a man at about the age of 2 in an executive world dominated by men we have seen that women are often objectified and sexualized rather than treated as human subjects peers and creators of worth this is a fact that has been increasingly uncovered within the metoo movement perhaps we should talk about the psychological impact of having a boss or professor that sexualizes you and how that impacts your academic and career choices and there lies the key word choices the idea of pure choice is an illusion often harked upon by the right wing and the neoliberal minded the idea that you can pull yourself up by the bootstraps something that literally defies the natural laws of physics and that the psychological reality of living within a patriarchical world as a woman is inconsequential and effortlessly surmountable as much as you glorify the individual who can defy the odds the sociological fact is that you end up with this  cents on the dollar statistic across the board again perhaps it's not that women choose low paying jobs but perhaps that a the material reality of patriarchy does in fact push women towards certain career choices and b the more woman that enter a field the less those jobs pay in the end of the day there needs to be a better reconciliation between the feminist academia and right wing think tanks like prageru these ideas do need to spar head on because without direct contradiction it seems like either side can pick and choose statistics and theories to prove whatever point they want to make case and point being this video) i think the arguments i made here validly complicate the above video and in fact nullify most of its arguments that women earning less is because they choose to"".",0,0

i feel like you have missed a critical point to the wage gap fallacy this is the fact that if you simply aggregate all of the data for full time men's and women's salaries then you are not taking into account that certain career's pay less than others and there are disproportionate amounts of certain gender's working in certain fields for example lets take teaching and compare that to construction work women are the overwhelming majority of teachers in most countries still to this day and yet teaching in most countries is considered a low pay job on the other hand construction work pays very well in most first world countries and is dominated by males you can make many other comparisons such as nurses vs doctors or retail service assistants vs research scientists and you will come up with similar results now the important question is why less women are choosing the higher paying career paths to this there is not a clear answer but studies suggest that women prefer jobs that involve more social interaction there are other factors such as strict fitness requirements for certain high paying labour-intensive jobs like construction however it is intellectually dishonest to ignore these facts just because we don't completely understand the underlying reasons behind them we need to be focusing on how to get more male teachers and female construction workers if you really want to close this gap' but i'm not so sure that's even the right approach if women want to work in a field that pays less then why should we tell them they can't what about freedom for women to choose their career and is it wrong that teaching should pay less than research science these are far more tricky to answer and no one seems to want to address these questions at all on this channel.,0,0

not to force a label on you but it sounds more like you are identifying with gender non-bianry or gender fluid/neutral you can feel femminie one day and want short boyish hair the next day and that's fine trans isn't quite the definition i would use personally maybe just gender nonconforming you can identify as those and not use they/them use any pronouns you prefer have people call you he/her if you like but trans is a different thing entirely from what you are describing here also saying you are basically a drag queen does not make you trans some drag queens/kings are trans some are not some are straight some are gay some are other things drag queen does not always equal trans.,0,0

to the comments about this being old footage it honestly doesn't matter whether or not she has eaten animals since this doesn't matter because the journey to veganism is not easy for most people trisha may relapse multiple times what matters is that she is making the effort towards being vegan its important that she keeps going back to it and getting educated so that she can figure out what works best for her and eventually get to the place she wants to be if you're vegan yourself think about how hard it truly was to transition probably you had to make many enormous life changes so you could become vegan trisha is just really starting this journey finally realizing how veganism is a good thing and she should let it into her life cut her some slack this is an opportunity for education not for belittlement if you don't welcome her into the community she won't want to or have the resources to stay.,0,0

this is a very misleading video and clearly has a lot of the people in the comments confused first off the title of this video is clearly wrong within the video it states that there is a wage gap but that it is produced by choice from this position you must then ask why women are choosing lower paid jobs there are multiple answers to this firstly the patriarchal society in which we live has tended to pay male dominated industries more this is not necessarily because these industries are of more value it is due to unions and wage debates over decades secondly women are told from a young age that they will be a nurse teacher or any other female dominated industry this is through all kinds of life also the idea that women should be the ones looking after a child are outdated this is a joint task for both parents.,0,0

it's pretty hard to believe in this wage gap when you aren't affected by it i mean why would someone pay females less than males it makes no sense but my mother has experienced this wage gap and institutional sexism in the workplace when she found out by accident that her male counterparts who had been working the same job same hours same past experience were getting higher wages than her for no apperant reason call it a lone case or a sexist boss but this could be happening anywhere in front of your eyes oh and this happened in a country with probably the most gender equality in the world.,0,0

everyone listen to jackb 234.. most women's lifetime priorities are for the sustaining and nurturing of future generations ie their children grandchildren etc which exacts a toll in time and strength.. being a working mom is such a pressure that most the wiser women would choose jobs that would not interfere that much with their maternal activities and routines.. thus less work time done more time for the young uns and the husband/lover to boot! hehehehehehehe i mean that gap is not even that bad.. you're right.. it's just the effect of the priorities that women have vis-a-vis that of men.. kudos!,0,0

"this is still where you are incorrect about any kind of earnings gap pertaining to gender) the gap doesn't exist at all to say that it is still only .6 makes anyone with this claim incorrect this is why politics suck a specific political stance will try to generalize everyone and think they are compatible within the generalization we are not like apples and oranges the comparisons are more like beets and bananas there has been a controlled scientific study that took a singular case under extreme measures to further disprove such a myth the males and females were of same age applying for the same position ethnicity and even the experience behind it the employer was told that the first  being hired could not have an increased starting pay if negotiated for it and needed females as well as males from each gender had to fit low class criteria the same rule also applied for black skinned and white skinned and so it had less discriminative power the other of each gender were going to be split the same way but of middle class this was a closed off year experiment do you know what happened within this study the men did 5 more work than the average employee all asked for more hours after - weeks this does not including job training and asked for a raise after the first year while the counterpart female was 0 less productive than the average employee females one lower class black and one middle class white took days off after years) only one of the females asked for a raise after in a half years additionally of the males were looking for another part time job while working with the one they had no wonder the gap is seen as a large problem between genders"" males just seem to work harder and they are reprimanded for it.",0,0

the main focus should be around peoples health everyone wants to be healthy on the other hand the majority of people don't care about the environment when they eat bottom line most people are selfish and don't give a @% about anyone or anything that is not related to them process vegan food is not health promoting and being vegan is not the answer to optimal health whole foods free of chemicals and minimally process are the key most restaurants and chefs are all about how to deliver chemicals throughout food if you want to eat rice boiled it in water and eat it stop falling into the artificial stimulation produced by the saturation and processing of food throughout added chemicals we are not carnivores neither omnivores otherwise meat would be perfect and wouldn't cause any problem whatsoever the main objection of people to make a change in diet is the fear of missing the food they think they love but the reality is than they can't taste good food because they are saturated and their senses aren't sensible enough after a terrible diet our taste improves dramatically over time after adopting a health promoting diet free of salty animal products sugar and oil find a way to demonstrate to people that they will not only be healthier but they will enjoy food like never before and realize that is nothing like sitting on the couch watching tv with the mind empty healthy people are more energetic and enthusiastic about food and that shows that is not the end of your happiness it's the beginning!!!!,0,0

hi freelee i've been thinking on going vegan for such a long time now i'd say probably months?? but i've never gotten around to this because my parents don't support this opinion and all they cook is animal based products i'm  so obviously i can't move out lol) i was wondering if you had any tips for going vegan even when everyone around you eats meat i naturally have never been obsessed over meat tbh like i never found the tastiness about it so that is not really what my problem is my problem is that my parents will not buy the large amounts of fruit that i need for the raw till diet that i really want to get to is there a better way to still be a high carb vegan without doing the raw till diet? thank you for influencing me and making me realize that animal based products are disgusting :,0,0

the whole thing about the wage gap is that it's talking about averages to examine an actual salary gap you have to look at it in specific fields not across all mediums because it's very clear that if you just average out yearly earnings and divide one by the other you're going to get a very general image of reality the truth is while men have been encouraged to pursue wealth and success for themselves for decades if not centuries) the same incentive wasn't true for women at least for a long time if not still and because of that many more women turn out to be stay-at-home parents or settle for small jobs less women in stem fields less women in big businesses less women in big roles not only because of a structurally sexist academic and professional universe but also because of it i'm sure there would be some difference most likely very significant if you were to compare a man and a woman in similar roles within the same company or across an entire field of work but it probably wouldn't be as latent as the wage gap we've grown accustomed to.,0,0

"ive seen alot of comments giving you food advice and i'm probably repeating alot of them.. but definitely eat alot of the whole simple foods.. beans(kidney black refried lentils etc..), oats like oatmeal for breakfast. try overnight oats they are the bomb with some frozen berries mixed in the morning of.. smoothies are good snacks.. i see alot of vegans eat a smoothie only as a meal like breakfast or lunch but that doesn't feel me up so i have like a green smoothie with my lunch or like a fruit smoothie with my lunch or as a snack any time in the day when i'm hungry.. you can make them even more sweet with some sugar cane juice or coconut sugar.. salads are good but make them more than just a basic salad. i like to turn my salads into like burrito bowls so rice beans tomotas guacamole corn salsa green onions,etc.. like up on pinterest simple easy vegan meals and you will find alot of ideas please remember that it is hard for everyone at first.. especially for the ppl just doing it for the aesthetics so remember the other reasons why you are going vegan. like for the animals and also for your overall health on the inside not what you look like on the outside )))",0,0

honestly i think you and trish are very similar you both have strong personalities but inside youre both sweet and both are going through relationship troubles i think you two should give friendship another go and help eachother through this and you can help trish with her vegan transformation and she can help you with collabs she has so many subs and so do you but she could have a bigger voice for the vegan community i see a friendship blossoming already!,0,0
i understand the backlash from this video i understand how misinformed most of this video is but as a member of the lgbt community i think this is an amazing opportunity to educate and correct her on what she thinks is being transgender i think that unfortunately many people share a lot of the same views that trish does in this video i don't know her motives for making this video or how her views became so inaccurate but the way that we as a community react to moments like these‚Äîwith backlash and hate or education and unity‚Äîwill shape the way the world views our community we need to find more ways to unite and educate rather than bash and cancel just my two cents.,0,0

trish as a person who has been a fan for many years i am very disappointed that you wouldn't go like and research before making a video this seems like a very spir of the moment thing honestly if this is how you feel you could be non binary not trans not trying to put you down or anything you don't have to identify as male or female as a non binary person i understand this not feeling like you belong but make sure you do your research before coming out as something you may want to come back from or regret i came out as trans not knowing really what it was thinking oh i feel more like a man than a female what i was actually feeling was me being non binary i go by they them now and it was a long journey and i always regretted coming out because i was super confused i have now come out a year later with a lot more information and am confident with who i am people have chose to make fun of me all the time now love you trisha but please do your research,0,0

this makes it sound like men are just more ambitious this wasn't a good explanation of this there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap if men were the humans that bring life into the world they would statistically earn less than women,0,0
this also does not discuss the fact that men with mba degrees work 0 more hours than women it also does not take into consideration the male ego vs the female ego in business the is one of the factors that contributes the need for continued exponential success in males slightly more than it does in females psychologically and physiologically men and women are different that difference is sometimes a good thing mean that females are better at certain things than males and vise versa this difference in skill can then used to run a successful business.,0,0

well trisha there is a difference between eating vegan and being vegan veganism is a philosophy and lifestyle that avoids animals products whenever practical and possible when you live vegan you stay vegan because you know that eating animal products is unnessary and morally wrong i'm glad you are making great strides trish keep it up and hopefully you can fully connect with the ethics from after hearing from other vegans ,0,0

what people who discuss this issue never take into account is the fact that men are generally more aggressive and take higher risks when it comes to finding employment they also are more likely to hold out for higher pay instead of taking a job sooner this vid also doesn't mention the fact that though women in dual income households take more and better care of the children men generally do more of the household manual labor repairs maintenance additions etc) yet another incomplete and misleading view of pay gap between genders.,0,0

yeah i can explain this pretty simply actually i've seen one of her vids where she says that she's been diagnosed at borderline i am borderline also let me just say that this is her very obviously going off the rails for whatever reasons she has bpd is something that requires a life of upkeep it's on the narcissistic spectrum she obviously hasn't been able to take care of herself appropriately and is now giving in to one of the symptoms which is basically that you feel like your core identity is completely malleable it's an identity crisis on steroids and she's trying to get back in touch with herself but she's going in the opposite direction to where she should be gigi probably got an earful from trish and likely isn't so sure about it but wants to support her friend trish was talking a lot about her ex if a borderline person is coming out of a good ol dumping that's when the abandonment issues can kick in this might be what that looks like for her questioning her identity because it wasn't good enough for someone and rebounding into a marriage.,0,0

im sorry but i think these facts should be examined carefully st companies do not only want to reduce costs they are willing to hire better professionals paying them more nd women tend to chose low paying majors not just because of simple individual will culture sex roles family etc are mediating variables that influences these decisions same in men men are raised hearing they should be/are good at math and fixing things also they are socially rewarded by compliments etc by being good at these fields no doubt they chose engineering and math as a major their toys as kids are astronaut dolls and mechanics women toys are babies and nurse barbie women are raised as the caring ones the mommy ones no doubt they chose social work and early education it is sexism people don't make decisions out of nowhere culture and society are playing a role there rd we need to examine why men are willing to be on call in a job men have the pressure to be the provider in the family that's why they are willing to be on call willing to have a better salary women don't have these pressure and the ones who have it are not the standard this video has some points but i think every idea exposed here needs to be discussed in a deeper way it shouldnt be this simple to talk about a subject this complex.,0,0

yea the wage gap is a perfect example of statistics being interpreted to suit someones needs its this fallback point that everyone uses cause it seems so unfair and they always use stats from degree educated people that work in still sexist fields of work the vast majority of people work for minimum wage and you don't see mcdonalds paying a woman 9c on the dollar just because of her gender she makes the same crap wage as the men there also men have a way higher rate of depression/injury/suicides at work cause they work themselves to death so their wife and kids won't leave them and shack up with a guy with a better paying job.,0,0

it's funny how vox admits that the argument is total bull at the very beginning of the video they admit that the wage gap is based on nothing but median wages of both men and women do you understand what that means that is the average of all female wages compare to all male wages it has nothing to do with females making less money for their time at the same job as a man it only means men spend more time working on average men tend to get pregnant at a far lower rate than women men tend to work more over time than women statistically men are more likely to do high risk jobs that have high pay men are less likely to work minimum wage low skill jobs than women men are more likely to work night shift jobs than women men are more likely to do physical jobs than women men are more likely to pursue lucrative college degrees than women men are more likely to own a business than women men are more likely to do dirty jobs than women men are more likely to stay with the same company for long periods of time than women not for doing the same jobs these are just a few of the examples of why if you compare the totals men make more than women after all if a company could get away with paying women 5 less than men they would only hire women.,0,0

"i have never taken into consideration the gender wage gap that seems to exist today so when the discussion came out during of our classes i was most definitely caught off track and honestly bothered in the youtube video there is no wage gap"" it gave us a bit of sense of why men are paid more due to education occupation position and hours women are paid .7 in comparison to every  that a man makes women are seen to have to juggle being moms with responsibilities inside and outside of work basically women are viewed as weak the video made it seem that women aren't as capable as men when it comes to working long hours especially at a last minute timing women however are not weak i know that they do take more responsibilities than men when it comes to their children but just because women are capable of taking on more roles doesn't mean they should have to face a wage gap when it comes to education i strongly believe everyone should be paid equally yes people get paid more for their seniority at a job but that is due to them having worked their way up there either by being their for such a long time or simply because they do their job right and get promoted in the end everyone should start off by getting paid the same in any career they have the youtube video and the reading we had assigned for homework sheth and gould 2017) includes a graph and tries to use that the excuse for this wage gap is due to women choosing low paid college majors leading to low paid jobs in a sense i see how it is true women go for ore of the motherly careers and i think that's how we women are seemed to be this gender wage gap does exist and some of its reasons provided in the video seem reasonable in the end however the wage gap shouldn't exist no matter the circumstance.",0,0

the  cent for every dollar a man makes has been debunked for decades women choose to go into lower paying fields than men when you look at the top  paying fields of study at university men dominate out of 0 there are a majority of women in only field of study and that's pharmacology 52 female 8 male...barely a majority when you look at the bottom  paying fields women dominate out of  fields psychology sociology early childhood education etc guess what folks a petroleum engineer makes more than a kindergarten teach or a social worker this video also glosses over evolutionary differences between men and women and how we evolved the gap exists in business more because men are more aggressive not only are they more likely to ask for a raise but they are also more likely to push hard for sales women use different tactics often looks and sexuality in business specifically sales i'll likely be called sexist for pointing out these facts but feel free to research them yourselves and ask any questions there is a pay gap between men and women for doing the same job but it's about % men also work an average of - hours more per week so women work fewer hours and tend to spend more time with their kids single women age 0-4 who don't have kids earn -8 more than their male counterparts why is this fact never discussed the truth is that men and women go into different fields mainly because of evolutionary biology it's why african americans are only 2 of the population but are 5 of the nba is it racist to say that on average a black man can jump higher and run faster than a white or asian man or is this accepted because it is not a negative either way it's a fact that cannot be disputed by science.,1,0

exactly if women can be paid with such a low salary then why not most companies hire women instead of men for certain jobs there are reasons for these wage gaps and it's not merely women are seen as being incompetent women are expected by society to dedicate their time for their family while men are expected to feed his family so men can spend more time on their jobs.,0,0

the wage gap is a lie stop lying  it's been illegal to pay women less since the 0s in america see equal pay act of 963  comparing someone that works housekeeping or in a call center to a banker or ceo is intellectually dishonest  any earnings gap is due to hours worked someone who works only  hours a week will always take home less than someone who works 0 hours a week amount of years with employers who give annual raises also effect earnings in companies that don't automatically give yearly raises and where a person has to ask for a raise if you don't ask you only have yourself to blame for not getting a raise  businesses are in it to make money if the wage gap was real the bottom line would argue that only hiring women would be in the businesses best interest.,0,0

cool video but i see some inaccuracies first off you say the . cents difference exists is because of choices but that . cent number comes up when you have already factored in the difference in choices on top of that the visual is misleading because it shows the difference shrinking from  cents to . cents which is not the case the difference shrinks from  $1.00-0.77 cents to . cents and then you just completely dismiss the . cents oh well we have no idea why the gap is there but just believe us when we say it doesn't exist' bad way to make a video then just say the wage gap is so much smaller then a lot of us think.,0,0

this video while has some correct information is presented and framed in a way to show the side of the argument that affirms that the wage gap is not real there are similar videos put out by other organizations that have the same format they present facts in a way that supports there argument and leaving out those that don't while that wage gap is not as big as some groups claim it is larger than this video claims the topic is very complex and there is no definitive answer because the every situation is different so to say its a us versus them argument is just letting a very complex situation fall pray to party politics.,0,0

if it is possible to hire women that add the same value as any man on a significantly lower salary then surely free market forces would ensure that no men are hired because the leading company in every industry would be the ones which exclusively hire women due to their wage bill being the lowest and therefore before being able to drive out all the competition with lower prices just a thought or maybe the patriarchy doesn't want its firms to be run in the most cost-efficient way because they love oppressing women too much clearly that is the more likely explanation......,0,0

watched this video much too late as in weeks too late i saw london and kalvin's vids though so i already knew this was a thing that happened i just realized something after watching this vid compared to my first impressions after watching london and kalvin's vids causing me to laugh at how ridiculous she sounded she looks like she's on meth given that high meth use can lead to various delusions and even an increased sexual desire i think her crazy thought process could very well have something to do with the fact that she's on drugs i hope i'm wrong if i am there's either something else wrong with her to show that she needs professional help or she's an expert troll playing all of us.,0,0

okay but like i do not agree with trisha i don't think she is trans but when you brought sam smith and the person from queer eye into it saying they wanted to come out for clout i do not agree with that yes they might not talk about it maybe because they don't just want the attention if they just did it for clout don't you think they will make it a bigger thing than it already is yes the person from queer eye might have not came out in 012 but that's because not a lot of people were okay with lgbt and gender identity and things like that back then it's 019 it is the best time to be coming out because you do have so many people supporting it and a lot more acceptance and a lot more rights not saying there aren't people out there who hate but i'm just saying its more accepted now then it was a few years ago but with the whole trisha being trans thing yes she is obviously doing it for the clout and views no arguments on that one.,0,0

the fact people who say that the wage gap actually exist disgust me if you are a company all you care about is profit then no men would ever work ever again because all companies would hire women because it's less of an expense it is also income not wage income is less because it is proven that women don't work as much as women and does not work as much overtime as men americans all live in a very very privileged life and the fact that you say women are less then men is just an excuse for their failures the fact that men have to pay more for car insurance is that definition of institutional sexism so don't say pink tax is a thing the fact that i have to go to the korean military to regain citizenship and a women doesn't is inequality.,0,0

this is good.. i like this.. we need more of this,0,0
there is no gap per hour worked as most people are lead to believe this video was sort of half admitting this but never was it mentioned that same job per hour worked is going to be the same amount of pay in aus industries have to abide by e.b.a's or enterprise business agreement which means who ever you are you get a set amount per hour this however does not apply to small businesses like a local fish and chips shop or something,0,0
trisha really seems to struggle with her identity i don't know her or her content that well only hear about her a little from emelia fart and shane dawson but from what i've seen i'm thinking she might have histrionic personality disorder as i can't comment on bpd seeing as how i don't know how much she fears abandonment maybe someone can inform me on that trisha definitely shows signs of radical attention seeking behavior and seductive mannerisms she covers quite a few of the symptoms of a histrionic can't take criticism well had a breakdown because ethan from h3h goofed a little bit on her) seems to make rash decisions now she believes she's trans which isn't something anyone should take that lightly) being overly concerned with physical appearance even though here she claims she walks around wearing no makeup but that's moreso when she's alone which is different) etc can't say for sure though since i don't watch her content directly nor do i know her personally she does generally give me a bad vibe like i can tell i wouldn't want to meet her in person ever.,0,0

a lack of action does not imply a negative action i think the biggest reason people think of the wage gap has some patriarchal influence is their firm belief that everything is a zero sum game they are unable to see that free trade and laws protecting the individual can help both parties without hurting a third party a third party is only hurt in the fact that a transaction may have not been completed individuals should have every right to pay for whatever they want when both parties benefit and nobody loses especially when purchasing or selling labor.,0,0

not certain why neofeminists feel it is incumbent upon them to lecture the world on the proper division of responsibilities within a relationship there are a myriad of reasons why and how a couple may choose to split their time between work home and family but regardless of the result it remains their decision to render and they typically do so to further the family's advantages not to promote a social agenda if either partner honestly believes they are being taken advantage of it is incumbent upon them to speak with their significant other and attempt to resolve the issue it is not the purview of progressive gender ideologues to resolve those issues for them.,0,0

so she's clearly nuts and is extraordinarily unbalanced mentally with all of these little admissions of her's that much is obvious looks like a woman acts like some women thinks like some women.. clearly a woman and she even knows she was born female has female biology and everything outward indicates an identification with this.. but thinks she transsexual but also or has in the past thinks she's.. you know what it doesn't even matter you get a person saying certain things out loud and they just lose all credibility the chances of a person coming back from that and ever mentally being capable of handling more or being more are slim-to-none she's not ever going to get more intelligent she was an idiot then and is still clearly an idiot now this is the problem with insular thinking particularly when you're not even remotely intelligent or capable of honest self-analysis or self-awareness you think stupid things for terrible or non-reasons and then you start to believe them because this stuff never came out of your mouth in the presence of intelligent honest critical people if it ever did at all trisha was never set straight and had it explained to her why she is wrong and will likely never be right for the rest of her existence best case scenario she's a troll that thinks this is somehow a good idea and that just makes her an asshole and an idiot worst case scenario she actually thinks this way and she's many neurons short a coherent thought and she's a different kind of idiot why are the available options never good all that saved me in this video was blaire blaire and that adorable nose-scratch she did.,1,0

in the video the myth of the gender wage gap it explains how even though might be a wage gap for women to men it is not large as most individuals believe it is the first time watching the video i was convinced that the wage gap may not be a big deal although going back to what we have learned in class especially in the lecture from monday we learned how the wage gap is very noticeable christina hoff mentions good topics to prove her point the one that struck out to me was if women get paid less why don't business just hire women they are less cheaper hoff has a strong stance when she explains how feminist individuals are not implementing important factors such as hours worked positions and education when they are calculating the wage gap this convinced me that the wage gap might not be as dramatic as people think it is after all these factors are implicated in the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real? it shows how adjusted measurements will be made to increase the possibility to use statistics for the wage gap women have a lot of responsibility and some even say more than man for the majority of women they are the ones in charge of picking up their children and taking care of their necessities like appointments and activities such as sports therefore all this responsibility has made women take fewer hours in their jobs or not work at all it is hard to conclude a solid stance because of what both side of the wage gap leave from the leader presentation we learned how clearly women do not make the same as men although from the video once other factors are entered it changes things so when will we receive the actual unbiased information in american household men make more money than women therefore most women work part time jobs or do not work at all if men and women are working the exact same job hours education capability and there is still a wage gap then more things should be done to stop it but only until the statistics are true in this country i believe that women still have a lot more freedom to make their own choices than in other countries.,0,0

i thought about this for a min in particular the first question especially bc this logic would then apply to other wage-gaps whether it ethnicity disabilities age and even something as small as employee physical appearance tall attractive people are statistically paid more so why not hire only short ugly people the reason is people inherently believe that the short ugly female etc person is worse at their jobs and deserves less pay or much more often they believe that the tall attractive white male will do a better job and therefore deserves more basically favouritism so to put it another way the first question implies that the hiring manager knows that a man and woman will perform the same task to the same ability but in reality prejudices impact how they perceive someone completing a task so the hiring manager will believe a white man will and does perform the job better and deserve more compensation.,0,0

i actually think this is a fair argument at least more than the black and white yes it does exist or no it doesn't exist arguments i think what it boils down to is that a lot of businesses have not evolved to 1st century standards there was a simpler time when most people got up around the same time worked roughly around the same time and went to bed around the same time that isn't true anymore so a lot of business structures need to change which is a far better solution than simply giving certain people more money especially if they do less work.,0,0

i don't get why she would even troll about this then again i'm not trisha and i'm not such an attention whore this does showcase the ease with which these statements are accepted in certain places which disturbs me can we please get all the poor souls coming out as trans psychological help most of the younger ones have a lot of other issues too and believe those should be treated first depression is shite anxiety is shite ptsd sounds like hell no matter how you look at it a lot of trans people need help in more ways than one i don't think trisha's behaviour helps one bit it does feel a little bit insensitive and the internet just isn't the place for these kinds of troll vids it would fit better on stage in the show of a comedian as a side note i get annoyed with the gender is a social construct thing technically gender is a social construct if you view in the way that gender is the way you express your feminity or masculinity which nobody means when they use the word gender in this context) and sex is biological however when people use it interchangeably i'm thinking they're wrong otherwise there wouldn't be a need for certain people to even feel trans nevermind actually go through the medical roller coaster in one way or another.,1,0

yesss!! im so happy for u trish!! be sure to have lots of grains also don't be discouraged in the beginning if you gain little bit of weight because your body is getting used to the metabolism from the vegan diet but eventually you'll start dropping the pounds a lot when i went vegan i am lost  pounds within the first two weeks so but i was vegetarian first so it was a little healthier than a carniat so just be aware that you might gain a little bit at first but then you'll start shedding off the weight nonstop! good luck!!!,0,0
she makes a lot of sense until she reaches the point where she tries to explain the .  gap by citing an example of a different variable other than gender and then somehow feeling satisfied that this means that the gender pay gap is basically non-existent why does she need to take the complete opposite side of the argument and say that the gender wage gap doesn't exist at all why can't she concede that it's possible that gender accounts for a non-insignificant part of the .6 unexplained gap?,0,0

when will this bs die off the differences are not existent when you take someone in the same profession working in the same part of the world to eliminate regional differences in pay and labors laws) the feministics twist this truth to suit them by combining the earnings of all men and women without regard for age profession or any other factors obviously an engineer is going to earn more than a teacher and a doctor is going to earn more than them that's just how it is considering the fields men and women work in due to their own interests and dreams we find that women tend to work as teachers nurses etc which are not very high paying jobs but come with a social component and are much lighter on the workload men tend to take more stressful and dangerous jobs ranging from mining sewage engineering off-shore work and more they are obviously much more strenuous and dangerous to one's life and limb but are crucial for civilization to function hence their pay is equally large by explicitly avoid this piece of common sense these feminists are peddling lies openly and people still buy it it's annoys me to no end that people are not using their brains even a little bit if you paid a doctor only as much as a regular office worker why would anyone go through the years long hell and massive risk to be a doctor same with engineers miners and so on.,0,0

i think this video does a better job of explaining the wage gap than most videos however they don't do a good job of accounting for men and women in the same exact career for example in my job as a lawyer where everyone in the equivalent position gets paid the same the wage gap should be non-existent if there happens to be one it's because women choose to work less hours than men for some reason not because they're getting paid less women make different life choices than men so that should be accounted for.,0,0

my hourly wage is less than my supervisor i however have probably earned more money total than my supervisor since i stated this job  months ago is that somehow descriminate against my supervisor no that's my supervisor and myself being given the option to earn alot of over-time if we were willing to work the hours my supervisor chose to skip the extra hours except for when he absolutely had to work i however went months straight of going to work every single day and then getting off days only sparringly and that's when they force me to take off my supervisor gets every weekend off but if you looked at only the end result of total money earned you'd ask why is the supervisor earning less than someone positioned under them? people who believe the wage gap idiocy will claim the supervisor is somehow being descriminated against when in reality as with the wage gap idiocy it's because of our different choices.,0,0
this is sad but it is true i'm  and i use to run track in high school too i was second best on my team i know how it feels to be a woman athlete and im bisexual so im all for the lgbt community but ill be damned if a trans woman come and take over and me becoming rd best on the team because she's a man that shit aint right im sorry but its not i'm all for equality but its not right for us natural women our bodies are physically different from there's weather they use hormons or not we cant beat a trans woman cause they are technically men that's crazy to me i understand both sides of this story but at the end of the day it is fucked up how now a days women got to go through this it isn't fair this equality act is giving inequality real talk,1,1

anybody who thinks that women earning less than men is a problem are somewhat wrong if a women wants to have a child and take care of that child then there is no need to try to make more women work i agree that it is an issue that jobs aren't flexible enough for women who take care of children but in the en it makes no sense to change how the entire world works because some people find it hard to do well in work and take care of a child also if you think about it businesses pay the same amount of money to the same amount of staff so having less women working means there are more men working or other women working who could then support the women who have children. money is not being lost from families if women work less.,0,0

yes that's right the choice is the difference a woman is expected to take care of children and run the household of course she is not willing to work on call of course she is less willing to move a man expects from his wife to follow him wherever he find a better job but a woman can't expect her husband to follow her where she finds better job as for the dangerous jobs the reasoning is the same the woman thinks that she has a duty toward the children and this duty precedes any high salary soooo.. if and when a man begins take same responsibility toward children and household the gap will disappear but for now...,0,0

this makes me so happy!!!!! my top vegan tip beans! they are so good for you and if you're worried abput protein that helps there's lots of vegan mexican food bean soups etc. and hummus will go great with those carrots! i also hope you know that this could be the start of a great chain reaction as someome who was so far from vegan and somewhat against it to try it now will help open a lot of those kinds of people's minds and your friends too because you and some of your friends if they try it too have such a big audience you will reach a lot of people and help the animals so much!,0,0
i agree with with many of the points in this video however i do think it would have been interesting to look into why there was a higher concentration of women in low paying fields i noticed many of the lower paying fields could be seen as more of a nurturing career path perhaps linked to the traditional idea of femininity and as said in the video workers who were more willing to be on call at all hours were better funded but being on call for single mothers 76 of single parent households would be difficult also in many households the mother is seen as the prime child carer limiting their ability to take on roles with round the clock call in.,0,0

the wage gap is simply the difference in behavior and interest among men and women in very wide population samples unless the individual is discriminated against or limited i don't see why we should try to fix something which is only a result of peoples free choices the solution would be to trade individual freedom for a 0-5 equity number that looks good on paper but doesn't actually make anyone happier sounds like a double loss for everyone.,0,0

what gender wage gap?,0,0
the wage gap has been reduced since 948.. that's a given noone claimed there to be a 20 wage gap in 948.. in fact back then the wage gap was closer to  to 0% on a long term effect laws and policies have lowered the gap considerably you can argue that women have different jobs than men but the fact is that they don't work 0 less hours so they shouldn't be paid 0 less regardless of what their occupation is you see the exact same thing when you compare the 0 poorest americans with the other 0 of americans the hour difference is nowhere near being equal to the wage difference.,0,0

"i have known about the wage gap for a long time but did not realize how significant it was in class we found out that some of the highest paying jobs such as petroleum engineering are primarily help by men and jobs like education positions are held by woman and they make significant less than males i think women are expected to be in these positions because of our motherly instinct"" what was not surprising was in some positions like serves in restaurants and retail the gap was smaller to me this job works in favor of women because they are more likely to be friendly and can get tipped on how attractive they are which is actually sexist) in regards to the us men and women's soccer team wage gap the women in recent years have been more successful and have more winnings than the men but are still earning less while the gap for the top players on each team are not significantly large the further down the list the larger the gap gets between men and women pay disparity in u.s soccer it's complicated, states that women require more health insurance and there a pay cuts if they become pregnant andrew das 016) this is a parallel to what we read in the textbook businesses cut a year of wages for woman because they are likely to take a year off to take care of family members and maternity leave adams et al 013) the video there is no gender wage gap, however argues there is no gender wage gap because the studies are based off of different careers/schooling men in women have but how can they explain the gap between men and women that hold the same job and equal amount of education?",0,0
its so amazing that you're going vegan congratulations its a lot easier than you would think just cut meat eggs and milk out of your diet there are substitutes for all of those things like tofu soy milk etc freelee's channel is extremely helpful in terms of getting the vegan diet started and i know you dont want to hear this but if you're going all out vegan its kind of a right of passage to throw your animal tested cosmetics away it is completely up to you though it's important not to be a vegan only for aesthetic purposes you will not only lose weight but generally feel better about yourself try and stay on it for a long time see what happens good luck!,0,0

do know companies would higher only women if they where cheaper to higher because your get better profit margins did to salaries bering lower this is what third wave feminist don't understand that it choices you make not what gender you are that shows difference in pay between men and women because work on average from women is statically less then men have babies therefore months to year off job men are more willing to do more overtime than women it pretty simple if you don't do the time you won't get a dime very simple basic economics.,0,0

they're right there is a lot that people miss about the gender wage gap such as.. men are more likely to work overtime men are less likely to take sick days even when sick men are less likely to use their vacation days men are more likely to ask for raises and more things there are reasons the wage gap exists and it's not just sexism.,0,0
"what's stupid about this video is that it only analyzes upper class jobs business sector jobs with 400,00 salaries are not at all representative of the wage gap the wage gap exists because working class and middle class jobs of particularly male predominate labor have traditionally been unionized steel workers plumbers electricians factory operators traditionally female jobs have not and they're almost all in the service sector i'm sure there are some social sexist reasons for that ironically as traditional masculine jobs are being outsourced abroad both men and women are today left with low paying jobs without a history of unionization that's a big reason why wages have been so stagnant for  years i don't write the news folks i just report it.",0,0

freelee's diet isn't good for the average person so you shouldn't follow her advice in terms of eating as much as you want as long as it's vegan she's very active so it works for her i know a lot of people that it hasn't worked for including myself it would've worked great for me had i still been an active handball player i would say eat everything you've been used to just make it vegan it'll be fun for you to try vegan products and experiment with that since you have the money to try it out.,0,0
"what we all fail to realize is the possibility that women may not get these opportunities.whether that be from being a stay at home mother or legitimate sexism/discrimination or choice.the pay gap might just be an effective way to illustrate a bigger point.that stuff appeals to voters and comes across as fact yet it's not,but it gets the job done and is easier.perhaps that's why politicians are citing it.",0,0
ok so as someone who did used to think the wage gap was more of a big deal i'm glad for this clarification but the wage gap isn't the only inequality between genders in the workplace is there anyone that knows of a paper that compares the salaries of women and men who work the same job i was disappointed that this video didn't cover that difference since that is probably where the -ish wage gap that does exist comes from legitimate question btw i'm not looking to pick a fight.),0,0

the wage gap is the difference between the gdp of women and men women avoid jobs like carpentry drywall plumbing roofing welding mining forestry flooring window and door installation home heating and cooling electrical wiring and power supply cement forming brick laying even for 4 hour with generous union benefits and lots of overtime women just don't want those jobs men to them and take home good pay cheques feminists only look at big league ceos and corporate board rooms as the source of the wage gap when in fact the wage gap is created everytime they call for a plumber to fix their toilet or have a guy install a new tiles in the kitchen.,0,0

you cannot eat as much as you want i am vegan myself but freelee's brand of veganism is predatory you are basically planning to eat straight up carbs and that's almost pure sugar you will retain water make you a salad girl eat some veggies bake tofu eat black beans veggies need to be the basis of your diet fruit is great but it can't be the basis of your diet do not be afraid of packaged veggies or fruits it doesn't matter if it's pre-cut eat your veggies eat some fruit eat some grains and get your protein in it's not a magic bullet you still have to work toward a balanced and healthy lifestyle good luck!,0,0
i think this day in age a lot of people want to stand out or feel like they dont belong so they will claim lgbtq and it's sad because of how many real people struggled for so long with gender dysphoria etc for me i thought liking girls would send me to hell i think it's become cool to a lot of people who aren't lgbtq and that makes me ,0,0
this is amazing hope it goes well for you  i've been vegan for a little while now and i've found its best not to be afraid of healthy fats as i personally find they help keep me full and as for eating a ton of stuff it's definitely not going to cause weight gain unless it's oreos and other junk haha also on top of that just remember that for a lot of people it does take a while to lose the weight because it isn't a diet that restricts and causes it to melt off quickly it's a slow but steady weight loss anyways good luck i know you'll do super well and you'll probably love the way it feels physically and mentally!,0,0

actually in the homecare in middle east female nurses are sought after and paid more than their male counterparts but i'm not here protesting gender wage gap it's a free market out there there is great demand and few supply for female nurses due to the local culture and tradition of islam of the middle east companies normally compete in the free market one can't easily change that culture likewise in the western culture you'll be paid for what you could physically that includes long ot and offer more than your counterpart be it a male or female i would want a firewoman to have a salary someone that could carry me and bring me yo safety if your smart enough to rake more profit to the company. then its just common sense. i wonder how many women would want to work in a sewer.,0,0

we don't have a gender pay gap we have a gender wage gap when we say that there is no pay gap that means that in the united states men and women are paid the same for instance if they're getting offered a job as a starting position at mcdonald's or a teacher at a public school it's illegal to discriminate on the basis of race gender or any other condition men and women are being paid the same in all hourly paid jobs but how much many men and women choose to work and how they work is the difference aside from women not even participating in certain strenuous industries like construction or landscaping where a lot of physical labor is required and there is a lot of money to be made women are also not keen to do jobs that are high-paying and heavy in mathematics and sciences as proved by college degree acquisitions modern women have had access to college for decades now and women are now the majority in college participation in the united states and yet women still steer clear from math and science degrees the women are choosing that nobody is stopping women from getting that boring math calculus or rocket science class these disparities are more than enough to account for the difference in how much the average woman and man earns in america now specifically to this video the most important issue is female psychology the idea that women don't want to work in general many women may value their alone time and prefer to have down time they may not want to work as many hours as men do not just for children but for their own personal development i know that not all women fit this archetype in fact the hardest working person i knew that used to work everyday two jobs was a woman so there certainly are busy-bee women out there that's not most women though most women don't want to be workaholics and more men are prone to being workaholics what i think is interesting is that even in this video we see this aspect of women wanting to avoid work playing out in this video we see how the way to improve things would be to make things more flexible and that men should do more housework in other words this video is pandering to the people who want things to be made easier for them make things easier on me it's too hard to work hours a day make it hours and give us more vacation and more money this is exactly the attitude that i'm talking about when i say that many men and women simply don't want to work or are always looking to push their work away a true mother wouldn't bemoan all the hours she spends caring for her children a person that loves to work wouldn't be thinking about when the next time they get off is gonna come we're talking about different psychologies here this isn't even to do with women or men because i've seen hardworking individuals on both sides and people who prefer doing recreational activities who are both males and females it's just that our culture happens to promote female recreational attitudes a bit more the reality is under a free market the hardworking people are going to outcompete and outclass the people who want more recreation in general that's the trade off that people who want more free time must make more free time equals less money under equal circumstances this video makes it look as if wanting free time or wanting more recreation is even desirable do you realize there are workaholics who never take any vacations and who never even have a day off and still have time to take care of their multiple kids let alone or kids that the average female worker has let the workers work let the market give the job to the men and women who actually want to work without complaining.,0,0

hey trish i'm also a new vegan but i have some experience as i've been a vegan for a few months now i eat a starch based vegan diet rather than what freelee eats raw till ) basically she eats an all fruit diet until pm an then she cooks a vegan meal for dinner and she's made countless videos on what she eats in a day definitely go check them out personally however what i find to be more sustainable is a starch based diet that a lot of vegans thrive on! here's an example of what i eat in a day breakfast mango smoothie i eat a smoothie for breakfast nearly every single day i freeze bananas and mangos and put them in it for a cool and creamy texture similar to icecream lunch three small brown potatoes with and asparagus broccoli and cauliflower medley i typically put a tomatoey sauce on top or sometimes barbecue sauce if i'm looking for some nice tang dinner basmati rice and black beans with an avocado sprinkled with granulated garlic i usually combine the mixture w tomatoes red onions and lime in addition i have a bit of salsa on the side snacks i only eat fruit for snacks remember to carb the fuck up if i were you i would stock up on rice legumes/beans fruit!!!! and vegetables whole grain breads and pasta and vegetable stock also try lots of lentils and stuff like quinoa the recipes are endless! also cauliflower is amazing and is good for a lot of vegan dishes i find the most of mine on pinterest it's amazing remember that you must eat in abundance on this diet and stray away from replacement items like daya cheese however if you crave those items spend the money on a vegan pizza every once in a while you will make mistakes but just remember to forgive yourself this is no temporary fix however if you want to see true long term results you must continue on a beautiful diverse whole plant based diet since my vegan transition i have lost the excess off of my stomach and see it being a lot flatter in addition my skin isn't perfect bc i do suffer from acne but it has become much more manageable and has cleared up tremendously throughout this journey you will see body results but it also teaches you how to love your body and also a lot about compassion i encourage to keep researching the vegan lifestyle and motivate yourself to continue love you trish good luck on your vegan journey!,0,0

vox loves to put out liberal propaganda the market is efficiently regulating wages as necessary further even if it wasn't that implies a great opportunity to fix it via the free-market as an employer would take advantage of lower waged women who as suggested produce equal output) government intervention is not necessary in addition to this i'm extremely skeptical of anything a liberal says after all at first it was just the 7 per dollar claim liberalism is a pack of lies starting with the misuse of the term liberal.',0,0

what vox missed it isn't a pay gap  that's been against the law since 963 it's an earnings gap because people make different choices most women want to have children  it's hard-wired into our species are you suggesting that they shouldn't they also want to raise their kids and tend to select careers that allow them to do so are you suggesting that they shouldn't men work more hours work more overtime accept more dangerous and nasty jobs and are more willing to travel away from home for work if women want to earn more there's nothing stopping them all they have to do is spend more time working most seem to want more balance between work and family and that is absolutely fine but the you can have it all indoctrination promulgated by certain activists is pure absurdist fantasy nobody can have it all you have to prioritize and juggle.,0,0

i would like to call myself a feminist it's not to say i want equal pay for all i want equal value of life for all the wage gap is as explained in the video reliant on so many variables i have most knowledge in norwegian studies about this where we have 7 of men's pay mostly because of not willing to work long/graveyard shifts pregnancies prioritising family over ovetime the difference in pay if you work for the private or official sector and people under  tend to earn less than their peers no matter the gender there is still a big gap though taking the electricians in norway as an example with the same age education employer and work hours there is still a gap of 300kr 750usd per month studies by official statistical bureau of norway i am waiting for them to find the reasons for that.,0,0

"so a . cents is acceptable the problem with this video is that you don't look deep enough you explain the differences by choices of career carreer evolution and working hour this is where the sexist issues are when choosing an orientation women are told that petroleum ingeneering etc is for men and that early education nursing and such are for women as for evolution we see that with equal education a man will be more and faster promoted than a women a study gave the same curriculum to companies half with the name john half with the name jessica the companies were willing to pay john ,00 a year more than jessica that is sexism in the enterprise finally women are working less hour because they are still the ones who have to take care of the children of the house etc so of course they can't stay as long in the office once all these problems have been addressed then we will see equality since you like maths you should know that according to the millions of people we are talking about the law of large numbers applies aif there was no inequality the pay difference should be infinitesimal thanks for reading until the end it shows open mindness.",0,0

want a real gender wage gap? i was working in a factory setting where the ratio to men:women was :1 the women were constantly handed easier tasks and complained about their tasks labor intensity often the men would be told to step in to fulfill the labor aspect for the women what really upsets me is that i along with other men working there are doing .5x a persons work while the women avoided a portion of their task and still gets paid as much or in lots of cases more traditionalism and equality don't mix well.,0,0
as a man the woman who was hired for my job before me made  more with less education and experience than me she literally made more than me for the exact same accounting job i don't think this wage gap is true you're stats are out of context of their papers that's awful science it's not even science at that point nowhere do your stats talk about women choosing responsibilities or their perceived quality of life this is click bait i'd say stahp but it makes you waaayyy too much money and you're a woman making more than many men just by making videos based on stats i don't have to cite as you don't either.,0,0

i think any hypothesis about a subject including this one should be discussed openly and objectively what bothers me is the feeling i get from reading all the comments most of you think the problems that women who call themselves feminists talk about are not true most of the people who comment are very supportive of rigid gender lines and responsibilities and i don't label myself anything i am myself some people may call me a feminist but i'm a human being who is trying to express myself and freely be myself without hurting anyone the fact that i am a women should not exclude me from any profession it should not force me to be feminine‚Äù it shouldn't force me to have children again i think most of the people who comment here would want all these things to restrict me or be denied to me it's very disturbing!,0,0
"i identify as a social democrat but i think a portion of the wage gap truly is due to other factors besides just sexism like experience time off and other factors a lot will disagree but i've looked at numerous studies i welcome all to do a lot the research yes sexism plays a role somewhat i just think people need to be realistic when it comes to issues like this i'm not saying this and other issues needs addressed in any way it does i'm just saying you can't put the blame on any on thing- it is due to multiple factors sexism isn't anywhere near the top reason is all i""m saying debate me if you want but i'm not arguing and name-calling.",0,0

the  cents to a dollar stat is only true if you compare apples to oranges overall if more librarians are women and more men are firefighters that means a man on average will earn more because firefighters tend to earn more but if you compare the wages of men who are firefighters to women who are also firefighters or any other profession) the wage gap turns out to be a lot less than  cents to a dollar so it is false to claim women earn  cents to a dollar doing the same work as a man*. politifact has rated such statements by politicians as false i really wish this video had made this point clearer.,0,0
the gender wage gap has been disproven a million times by a million different people including economists independent researchers and even the government the only reason that it appears this way in some studies is because the studies are not done correctly rather than look at the average pay for people working the same hours at the same job at the same company and the only variable being gender the look at the total amount of money earned by women and men in the united states which is not how you do statistics this is because it does not include the types of jobs people from the two genders are choosing for example the stem fields which pay among the highest salaries are almost solely male despite the colleges trying to convince women to go into stem for many many years the mainly female dominated industries are things like childcare cosmetics and social studies which do not pay anywhere near as much as the male dominated stem fields and other male dominated areas please stop spouting the third wave feminist nonsense as fact because it's objectively not.,0,0

the factual feminist here on youtube did an entire series on why this wage gap is basically just a statistical variance in how people choose what to do with their lives women are not at all interested in dangerous dirty disgusting professions like sewage and mining and construction these do not appeal to women at all they would rather have a fun safe low-paying job than a miserable dangerous high-paying job men are the sacrificial laborers of our society and we pay them significantly more than women because of that that is also why women take on the dominant role in the household because the man is more likely to die and it mitigates the damage to the home if he does these could be socially constructed things or just pure evolutionary necessity either way the wage gap doesn't tell any of the story it's just a statistic that keeps getting repeated over and over again with no context.,0,0

i'm so close to subscribers.thank you everyone for all the support you're the best!,0,0
i thought that this would debunk the wage gap as what it really is being an earnings gap the earnings gap states that overall women make less than men with roughly  cents to a dollar being the figure that they come up with this is statistically true since on average most studies on the subject have shown that men more often ask for raises apply for the highest paying jobs ie. stem) tend to go into overtime more often and that men aren't biologically capable of having children as such men tend to work longer hours and with the same pay earn more women on the other hand have all of these obstacles to overcome if they are to work for the same time and earn as much the icing on the cake is that the pay gap has been made illegal therefore all companies who do this are to go to federal prison as such there wouldn't be a pay gap anywhere in the united states might i suggest you research what you hear before making a video.,0,0

here are my tips for you 1)the most important tip is to eat until you get full do not try and eat as much as freelee you will feel sick 2 keep it simple don't try to follow in sort of guidelines what i mean by this is do not eat a bunch of raw foods because it's not pm yet if following raw till  trust me you will end up over eating because you didn't have what you are craving 3)just about everything can be made vegan if you get a craving have a little bit for example i crave pizza chocolate waffles etc. what i do is look up vegan recipes where to find those vegan teams and eat them if i crave chocolate i buy the bar and i eat a square or two and then tuck it away for a rainy day 4 while any exercise is good exercise i recommend you do a little more than normal ex taking a morning walk/jog as well as dancing 5 educate yourself it well help you build a deeper connection that way you stay on track if you get off track get back on you're gonna do great!,0,0

you need to seriously educate yourself before making a video like this unless you have dysphoria you are not transgender not all transgender people got through the whole transition...meaning surgery most can socially and hormonally transition and that is enough you need therapy and education you are offending true transgender people by saying you are 00 female and ok yet are transgender this is a joke you don't have dysphoria therefore you are not transgender.,0,0

ahhh trishy this is so exciting okay my favorite go-to is beans rice beans have a good amount of protein and the rice helps keep you full pasta is also really good and since you apparently like carrots based off this video you could do some thinly sliced carrots in the pasta and it would be so good and if you like avocados they have some protein too they also have some fats that are good for your body and they can be spread on toast and have a relatively similar texture to butter protein shakes are another good option and i frequently have those for breakfast and if any of your bananas get really soft and overripe peel them cut them up and put them in the freezer so you can blend them up to make banana ice cream as a sweet treat good luck with these weeks and i'm sure they'll open your eyes to everything you can still eat as a vegan i promise you won't be missing out on anything it's such an awesome lifestyle!!<3,0,0

veganism is good for numerous reasons but you cannot expect a body transformation in weeks your body might retain some of the food you are eating since you've been starving yourself naturally more water weight because the fruits foods you will be eating naturally have more liquid you will definitely probably see results in your skin recommend foods potatoes they will keep you full for a long time don't have any fat instead of frying bake them put spices on it find a low fat sauce you can dip them in if you'd like frozen smoothies in the morning just buy those frozen mix of fruits you see at the supermarket blend with a bit of water or almond milk maybe some vanilla i wish you the very best on your vegan journey üíó,0,0

wage gap isent a thing comparing all the avrg of all men and all women what you actualy get is a representation of how strong the difrence between the rich and the poor is lets say 00 people from group x get to earn 00 a month another group of 0 people caled group y earn 00 aswell yet 5 of those do not have eny income and  of those have an income of 0000 now you have a group in wich the avrg earning for 0 people is 00 and 0 people in this group wherefor the avrg earning is 500 now you have an avrg of something around 10 for group y so yes on avrg group x will earn les then group y but do you realy want to be a part of group y where you have a .5 chance to end up in poverty and posibly die of starvation at the off chance of .5 where you might earn more money as you can spend on top of that you have to take into acount that those who are earning 000 a month probably are giving up the chance of a personal life starting from there 0's to there 0's now so lets say you dont want to be a part of this group that gives up everything to earn money now you are just stuck with a .75 chance to end up in poverty and a 1.25 chance to earn a living unlike the 00 chance to earn a living so you tell me would you rather be a part of group x or y i know what my answer will be i would like to be part of group x and on avrg earn les then group y this btw isent taking into acount chance of having an acident with permanent disability working conditions and all other kinds of bs u whud rather not deal with.,0,0
i disagree i know a true real life example of a wage gap i know a professor who got a job in a southern college and was paid less than her husband who was hired a year later he has less education and less experience than she does and yet she was told that he earns more because he is head of the home and that they both receive the money so why does it matter how each of them get paid they quit and got a job at a college in the north instead she now gets paid more since she works harder than her husband and has more education and experience.,0,0

women should be the ones most upset with this to work for equality and to train hard for a sport only to have the success taken away from you and then not being able to speak up because you will be considered transphobic a person has the right to be what they want to be but a biological born male should never compete in women sports period its just not fair.,1,1

"after watching there is no gender wage gap, it has left me with a lot of questions and some clarification on certain things this video proves that there is a gender wage gap but it also clarifies where and how there is a gap between women and men pay i think that the main thing that is being overlooked would be that not all women can work full time or half the time that men do because of child care and other obligations that they have as a woman usually it is just known that woman do all the housework and childcare while the man is out working and making money why don't women get paid the same amount that men do especially when they are doing more work then just their employed job if the situation was flipped and women got paid more i don't think that men would let it go by as easily as the women do not by choice but that it's just what the case is with professional soccer in general whether male or female it has a lot of work put into it the video why is women's soccer so white? it points out a lot of things that differ from men and women professional soccer teams the pay gap with men and women ties into the soccer world because men get paid a lot more than the women do and the fact of the matter is that the women bring home more titles than the men a quote in the reading paid disparity in u.s soccer, that stood out to me is equal pay for equal work is this not a true statement just because the women's team are women and not men so in the end is it just sexism taking a tole.",0,0

"essentially this video is correct and i agree with it however it is misleading to call it a wage gap"" if you want to get rid of the wage gap stop comparing yearly earnings hours worked times pay per hour but instead just compare the pay per hour there is no difference in pay per hour therefore no wage gap a woman's decision to have children is her own choice and she should take into account that she will make less pay if she works less hours to take care of her children seems pretty obvious but anyway) it's not societies problem.",0,0

if everyone went vegan then the demand for vegan based food would rise unfortunately vegan based food does not last all year due to seasonal changes so food has to be sourced from other regions of the planet in the meantime large acres of cleared land will sit dormant in the colder seasons awaiting a warmer climate before crops can begin growing again the price of food will rise significantly due to the capitalists control of the markets being vegan isn't going to save the planet deforestation is the leading cause of climate change which will continue to expand as global capitalism takes control what you eat is irrelevant...,0,0

just because a wage gap isn't necessarily 00 the cause of employers intentionally saying to themselves i think i'll pay x group less doesn't mean that wage gap is automatically innocent or rather that only the portion which we can directly connect to an explicit intent to discriminate as the cause of the gap is problematic and/or unfair and/or discriminatory) as the narrator herself points out--there are many possible explanations including factors influencing these choices men and women make as if choices have ever occurred in a vacuum free of human or natural influences on one's considerations one's so-called free choice) it is still entirely possible that the difference in career choices and educational opportunities can be explained less by women's willingness to accept lower compensating fields of work but instead the tendency of the whole society many of those women included yes to segregate and/or self-segregate women in to particular kinds of work and roles that may or may not be paid or paid as much as roles society at least much of society historically has preferred to push men towards and women away from as much as possible--with varying degrees of explicitness).,0,0

as someone who has studied labour economics and with some statistics training this is one incredibly hard question in both technical and philosophical level we need to distangle all the contributing factors to wage which is never a possible thing to do second labour market itself is distorted in so many ways and the pricing mechanism isn't just one orrange is just like another orange in other market we are pricing people here even assuming we are living in a perfect world that we can price every factor goes into the wage experience education...) is it morally just to pay women less for the factor like pregnancy maternity leave that can negatively affect the operation of a company?,0,0

i truly agree with the video there is no gender wage gap‚Äù i think having a wage gap is all mental a trick your mind plays because we see a large number of successful people being males an example from group presentation would be the magazine forbes this magazine is successful people and most of the people on their front cover have been males i has agree with there being no wage gap from the beginning of speaking about the topic but never thought of speaking out and giving my opining because i thought i would been criticized and be looked as a bias person the fallacies in the argument is just like said in the video and command sense and its all about the choices each gender makes its command sense because if a guy and a girl both work at mcdonald they are both getting paid minimum wage same amount of money for the hour but all depends who wants to work more and longer hours an example how choices is key to an argument like the wage gap would be the saying of females live longer this is because its usually the male who pull out ridiculous dangerous stunts that sometimes kill them its all in the choices one makes there is no difference on how much females and males get paid like the video there is no gender wage gap they explain how the number 7 out of dollar and that is just what average females make divided by what the average male makes all the factors that fall in to where the money goes people make counts too like said by the website the wage gap state by state that most families depend on the females overall it's the factors and choices one makes that make males look like they are getting paid more.,0,0

so this video is saying that the wage gap is a myth but then says it exists about  because of women's own poorer choices what a bad argument and how much it ignores society's discouraging attitudes towards women going after careers in the sciences or leadership positions it disregards that sexism exists in the workplace it's not anywhere near common sense to say working long hours aka as many as your company wants you too determines your work value when specialized skills and benefits to having a secure and healthy are not even considered as part of a career.,0,0

aaaaand yet again a clearly feminist outlet obscures some important facts one men are expected to earn as much as possible to be viable partners two working longer hours equates to job experience three child rearing and household duties require availability and men being expected to earn the bulk of the household income directly negates that four  percent of unsheltered homeless are men five more than  percent of workplace morbidities/fatalities are men six men on average work an extra to hours a week seven millenial women are outearning their male peers it's interesting that people that clutch the wage gap so close to their heart never address these issues.,0,0

get beans lentils rice i suggest a lot of starches so you can get the satisfied feeling that you are use to then start eating more lighter foods as you become more active and ect read up on the starch solution and always be low fat and don't use any oil in your cooking for the best health results you may not loss a lot of weight right away because your digestive system will be cleansing and getting use to higher volumes of food,0,0
facts are mostly correct but the main question remains why are those choices what women choose it's because society doesn't provide a level playing field for women the expectation especially from the right is that women should take care of the children and thus make all the sacrifices.,1,0
as a transgender man i agree and experience some of the things trisha said but also greatly disagreed with other things i'm not going to say trisha is lying or trying to just get attention right now but i'm not fully convinced since trans people should transition to identity as their trans identity i'm on the fence and wether or not i take this seriously all relys on trisha's actions from this moment on,0,0

i have no beef with transgender people but there is a reason why men and women are separated in sports in the first place men's bodies are different from women's period a transgender woman does not have the body of a biological woman and that is just the biology behind it either they should compete with biological men or better yet they should make a separate competition only between transgender people.,1,1
maybe trisha will come out as otherkin next and identify as a wolf.,0,0
well to answer her question why business wouldn't just hire women if they're paid less i assume that there are a number of reasons for that the most important one is probably that a lot of male company ceos consider women to be less qualified or reliably so they're willing to hire men instead even if they cost more also the video presents the information rather misleadingly for example she says that the adjusted gender wage gap is the result of choices of the women and that she wants to look at those choices but she immediately switches back to the non-adjusted wage gap reasons that gives the impression of her explaining why the adjusted wage-gap is incorrect while she actually just explains the non-adjusted wage gap the adjusted wage-gap is still somewhere between 0 to 8% and even if it would be just 8% then the question would be still there why women should be fine with earning  less than men and why are so many guys in the comment section wanting so badly the gender wage gap not to exist what would you lose if everybody would be paid equally for the same work?,0,0

hey trish i eat a lot of rice with beans for protein) and pasta i also like to make wraps or burritos french fries or onion rings fried in vegetable oil not too healthy but good lol) you should also try any kind of veggie burger they can be hit or miss but most of the ones i've tried have been so good just make sure you get it with no mayo or cheese and the bun is multigrain/whole wheat bc those are usually vegan as well good luck ),0,0

the problem with this discussion is that people judge the value of a job based solely on the amount of money it gives anyone who has ever looked for a job knows that money is not the only thing one considers you also look at not only flexibility but also commute time travel requirements workplace environment risk of injury opportunity for advancement and many more what this means is that a woman can make less money than a man at the same job while still getting the same value from it even if there is a gender wage gap that doesn't mean there is a gender job-value gap,0,0

not once did this video mention sugars and carbohydrates the abundance of which is killing us across the world. it is not the meat people if carrots soy and celery gets you off the sugars and carbs full power to you if the meat and dairy gets you off the carbs full power to you all food is produced at some cost to the environment get over it rubbing a pigs belly is nice and sweet but if the vegans get their way there ultimately won't be any of these and other animals left and in the next few years when this experiment proves to fail it will be too late enjoy your honeymoon on this diet but your long term health reality check awaits you we have  harvests left before the earths agricultural soils are depleted or are simply blown away in the next dust storms.what then i have no right to force you to eat animal products and you have no right particularly on ideological grounds to tell me i can't my meat and eggs etc.in australia are grass fed and finished and the cows replenish the fields in which they reside to regenerate the soil with their droppings they drink the water which falls from the sky if the americans are caught in a never ending spiral of factory farming and all that it entails then they need to get their house in order good luck!,0,0

is someone willing to talk to me about why it is hard for some ladies to understand that there will be the wage gap for men tend to take risks and the jobs that go along with the risks are rewarded with a higher pay if majority of women do the jobs that are secretarial oriented they shouldn't expect to be paid more or equal to the man climbing a 5ft tree or digging out sewers and of course you forget the electricians who have to work themselves through the wires and some get electrocuted therefore women and men can not make the same because men tend to go for the jobs which are high end risky and jobs that involve a lot of mental capacity put into them and men do very good at them that's my take on the issue.,0,0

so women get paid less because they take care of their children and do more housework and work for less hours for the same job than men ok so feminist myth debunked that for the same amount of time worked women get paid less its quality and quantity that matters to make money so money quality of work x quantity of time given hence even if quality of both genders remains same the quantity of time poured by women is less because of her maternal instincts which should not be booed by feminists i respect good mothers who pour in a lot of efforts in their job as well as to their kids men and women are simply just different if we try to make them look equal or make either gender be superior then its wrong proud egalitarian here ),0,0

it's okay to be confused i confused body dysmorphia for gender dysphoria and i was under the transgender label for two years i was lost and didn't have answers to my questions i am now happy and going by she/her born gender it's okay to be confused and try to find yourself what's not okay is saying you are trans when you are 000 comfortable with being the born gender you are it's okay if you want to be t and you want to be more masculine however i dont think this is the right label now when you are finding yourself it's okay to go through things and see what fits and what doesn't but i would suggest making that a personal journey off camera and coming back when you find yourself the trans community and the lgbt community in general get a lot of hate because people throw labels they know nothing about on themselves as a trend trans people are no longer valid in societies eyes because of transtrenders not saying what you are going through is a trend but it's something that takes more time and shouldn't be determined by the fact that you like gay men and you feel like you would be more respected if you had a penis it's true you may not be just a cis women and i hope that you are able to find and love yourself because that's all anyone deserves i don't think you should be hated but i don't think you should jump into this label either because it will only cause backlash for you and the trans community with that said i hope you do well and find who you really are in the end you are the one who knows yourself best,0,0

poor families are two income families while rich families are one income families where usually the man works  hours per week while the woman stays at home managing the household and that's mostly because those women want that if the relationship is new and the guy loses his job and can't find a good one and doesn't get a good income anymore there's a big chance she will find another boyfriend . that's how men are stimulated to put a lot of care into their career the same way that women are stimulated to put a lot of care into their looks what this means is that women from rich environments often choose not to work while poor women often don't have that choice and a result a larger percentage of working women come from poor environments that is the primary reason why men get payed more it has absolutely nothing to do with men having more chances the only places they might have more chances is in top business functions sports or acting or careers like that where salary is entirely arbitrary but this is only relevant to at most  of the population.,0,0

tbh she lost me during the video she jumped between too many things.. from what i saw she didn't explain about how the waige gap is calculated she didn't explain how ment tend to work overtime.. women on average work 6. hour weeks while men work about  hour weeks.. if you divide the numbers women roughly work 0 of the time.. now if we calculate time taken off for child care vacations ect women will work far less than men not including the overtime men work.. she also didn't talk about how women tend to choose lower paying jobs and fields than men.. there's another huge factor,0,0
i liked the explanation but think she should have included why the wage gap in the tech field is almost non existent as she said it has a lot to do with hours of availability and with many jobs in the tech field having the option to wfh at least part of the time it saves trips into the office i found wfh is great as long as you make sure to get out and do something during the day as well it doesn't really matter what just as long as one makes sure to leave home for a while otherwise motivation burnout begins to set in.,0,0

first of all congratulations your body won't magically transform in two weeks but you'll feel so much better and you'll see differences in your skin and overall health before i went vegan i struggled with multiple eating disorders i still struggle but the vegan lifestyle lets you eat in abundance.. which your body wants because the food you eat is your energy stay carbed up of course but also drink plenty of water at first i started to replace animal products with vegan products such as almond milk go veggie cheese earth balance vegan butter bagels daiya cream cheese boca burgers boca chicken patties gardien orange chickn oatmeal with maple syrup peanut butter and vegan cereals humans are addicted to dairy and cheese so replacing them with a vegan option helps curve the cravings although all the food i mentioned is vegan junk food i just wanted to let you know that there is literally a vegan option for anything and that you're not missing out xo good luck!,0,0
"as much as i think trisha is a nut case and no i personally don't think she is trans but we cannot put all transgender people in the same box that there is only one way that is works"" that everyone must feels the same way in their journey etc if there was a step by step to how it works"" it would be a hell of alot easier for people struggling we cannot tell people how they feel we never know what people are truly feeling or going through as much as trish is talking rubbish in my opinion we still don't know about the demons she fight inside herself. which is what we all deal with at different levels every day no i'm not a fan of trish at all but people go through sh*t and i think we need to be sensitive to it",0,0

it's nice that this video marshals research for evidence but unfortunately it's very selective and biased most glaringly the argument ignores decades of research which has looked into the role of gender and negotiation in perpetuating the wage-gap on average for example women are less likely to initiate negotiations for their salaries less likely to counter-offer and more likely to make greater concessions and while this is a choice it does not follow as the video tries to claim that preference and sexism are incompatible on the contrary what the research shows is that when women negotiate assertively on their own behalf they are perceived as acting in a stereotypically incongruent manner i.e not relationship oriented and are therefore viewed negatively by their counterpart in other words women have to face a trade-off between power and likeability that men do not have to deal with which is kinda of like the definition of sexism) as a result in a conscious and strategic effort to avoid social backlash to dodge being perceived as pushy or nasty women tend to either avoid negotiations all together or be less competitive hence they get less over the course of a career these numbers really add up fascinatingly the negotiation gender-gap all but disappears when women are asked to negotiate on behalf of others they are more comfortable being aggressive and are less likely to be judged harshly for doing so as women who negotiate on behalf of others are not violating a stereotype) yet this representation approach tends to put a lot of people in a difficult bind perpetuate a stereotype or wait till the system is transformed.,0,0

while this is all true it doesn't question why jobs that are primarily male occupied are paid more than jobs that are female occupied why are teachers paid less than say advertisers because this is capitalism and your value is determined by your contribution to the flow of money out of consumers pockets into the hands of the top %) if you can make money for the biggest companies that are all controlled by just a few hundred people either by creating a product marketing that product through the media or by being an influential actor or athlete or by altering the publics view of your company in a positive way then you will be rewarded with a big paycheck many govt jobs are male dominated as well but why don't women gravitate to these higher paying jobs as often as men because of gender roles instilled in us since birth men are told at an early age to be tough not show emotion be confident and that their worth is determined by their personal drive to succeed and be the breadwinner woman are told either directly or indirectly through the media to be nurturing respectful not be too loud or else be called bossy or a bitch and that their appearance is what matters some of these things are less extreme than in past years and more women are entering stem fields but turn on a tv and its clear they are still common tropes society shapes who we become and the choices we make and it's clear that white men are in the highest positions of power in this country and decide what we see and hear in our daily lives why would they not push messages that keep them in power just look at trump and his rich white male cabinet another thing to consider is that when women do end up in male dominated fields such as the oil business they are often harrassed and considered inadequate for the job this video also ignores the study that found when two identical resumes are submitted to employers with the names john smith or jane smith john gets hired more often this video is too simple for such a complex problem.,0,0

well going vegan doesn't just mean changing what you eat it also includes beaty products such as lotions soaps bath bombs and make up for example her false eye lashes she uses aren't vegan most mascaras are made from bat manure it's very hard to find vegan mascaras and most lipsticks are made from crushed up beatles i know very gross but i believe she will try very hard but it takes someone very very special and i don't think she's cut out for it.. i could be very wrong,0,0
i'm not trans but i had an actual diagnosis of gender identity disorder from a psychiatrist  years ago there's a distinction here i think of myself as a very masculine woman but not trans trans requires that you actually make effort to look like the gender you believe you are i can't bring myself to transition because i know it isn't a cure-all to do so i don't even think i could handle the mental changes that come with transitioning having a diagnosis of what is now called gender dysphoria doesn't make me trans.,0,0

okay so you normalize for job title and years of experience but that's the problem men are much more likely to have roles in management and high paying job titles than women women are burdened with having to take care of children and work a full-time job at the same time while the majority of men can just focus solely on their career and be home just in time for dinner to be ready while not contributing much else to the household and i could bet you that my male coworker who has worked there less than i have gets paid more just because he has a masters degree next to his name and because he's a male even though i have much more work experience in total than he does because our indian boss comes from a culture where there is a huge bias of gender and education title.,0,0

but what about the fact that men are more often considered for promotions that identical resumes with the only difference being gender result in the female being offered lower pay or flat out rejected why is it that the national women's soccer team pulled in more views on their world cup victory but was paid a fraction of the men's team who didn't even come close obviously theirs a lot of factors that come into all these calculations and a lot of good points are raised in this video such as the dangerous work conditions but i think with the information accessible it is still hard to discern where the issue lies women are more likely to be stay at home parents whereas boys are often more encouraged to pursue these high paying careers likewise that men are more willing to work longer hours and are very possibly more qualified i believe that their might still be a gender wage gap at play but its a lot more complex than a lot of people put it out to be in my opinion more research and information should be gathered in order to finally put this question to rest.,0,0

it's more complex because it's inaccurate it doesn't represent reality at all women and men at the same level of experience and seniority in the same fields earn pretty much the same the reason there appears to be a gap is as you said women hold disproportionately more lower paid jobs like child care etc whereas jobs with higher wages like dangerous jobs or jobs in stem fields are predominately male filled men also work for more years on average and take less paternity leave than women take maternity leave mostly because they're offered a lot less) men are also more aggressive in salary negotiations on average and are more likely to ask for a raise.,0,0
blair can you answer a question are for me why is it that most trans women seem that they do not respect the space of natural born women and why don't they want there own space i think it is very disrespectful and insulting to all women that trans women think that have the right to say they are real women cause the fact remains they are not it seems they don't even have pride in being trans they want to be a natural women but will not and can not ever be no disrespect it's just fact common sense thanks for your time.,1,0

wages=!earnings talking about a wage gap is incorrect if there truly were a wage gap then companies would hire more women to save the money from the wage gap what we have is an earnings gap yes men make more money but not because we get paid more for the same job and the same amount of work more men choose work over family time more women choose family time over work here in lies the difference there is nothing to fight for as there is nothing to fight against it is illegal for companies to discriminate based on gender.,0,0

lady you forgot to mention how women still lag behind their male coworkers by % rather than 2% after controlling for age education and years of experience and there's a 7 difference in total pay between men and women also when you separate income data by occupation the gender wage gap becomes even clearer the biggest gender wage gaps due to occupational segregation are seen in jobs located in business finance law and health-care occupations that are primarily self employed such as chiropractors the smallest wage gaps are seen in technology and science industries and health-care positions with a small degree of self-employment like pharmacists.,0,0

if you want to put a quick stop to the gender earnings gap you ought to immediately and completely free up the markets and allow capitalism to thrive if a business pays people any less than they deserve that person leaves their job whenever possible to get better benefits somewhere else you pay a person too much your competitors can run more efficiently than you then and top your profits you might worry that structural sexism would throw a wrench in this system not to worry market forces are very robust against bigotry because again the company that pays its employees based exactly on how hard they work will outcompete and outemploy startups from locally to internationally the worst thing you can possibly do to exacerbate an earnings gap is to give subsidies to certain corporations and make unions and employment restrictions if a ceo entrepreneur worker or business as a whole earns money from subsidies welfare or union dues all of which are illegal to not contribute to these funds are socialized/forcefully taken from citizens they have no reason to pay their employees fairly or price products fairly they don't need to work hard at all to earn this perverted capital yet it seems so many who decry this gap are more interested in collectivist egalitarian ownership of wages rather than allowing people basic property rights and the ability to get employed where they want to you'll compromise against actual solutions towards the gap every single time which demonstrates you really don't care about this issue at all.,0,0

the pay gap itself comes down to submissiveness if you don't stand up for a better wage you forfeit it and you cant complain men tend to follow the ask and it will be given to you principle more all potential employees men or women are usually offered a standard to low rate its your responsibility as an individual to deny a lowball offer/ask for a higher offer for if you accept it you share equal guilt to the unfair transaction and have no right to contest what you forfeit and as women tend to forfeit more than men its not the pay gap that's an issues its the inability to ask.. its not just women many men also fail to ask modern day feminists tend to find excuses and demonize the patriarchy they believe exists to deny their fault note just because you believe something to be true doesn't mean it is.. and if the patriarchy does exist its because women let it happen...,1,0
trisha or t or any name you decide to use i don't know where to start with this video i myself am a gay transgender male the huge thing with being transgender is the want for more masculinity than feminism i like to present myself as a male dress as a male be called a male seen as a male nothing else not my birth gender i have dysphoria causing me to dislike my chest my genital and anything that makes me look or seem more like a female all true transgender males have dysphoria and discomfort with being a transgender male you do not identify with being a girl the birth gender you want masculinity you want to be seen as a girl i honestly believe you are a little confused and questioning look into being gender fluid gender fluid is when some days you love to present yourself as a male then some as a female people who are gender fluid us he/him and she/her pronouns most often meaning you don't have to use they/them pronouns please just look into it also a lot of the stuff in your video is very offensive you say you don't like labels yet you're using them gay males are perceived as galled up and feminine in a way but most aren't that way also saying you believe you're transgender due to loving short hair not having to tend to it girls and others can feel the same also when you say straight men turn you off that is so darn weird you automatically aren't attracted to a male because they're not gay that's almost like being transexual only liking and wanting to date trans men and women it's just really strange and i don't agree with judging someone on their sexuality it's almost heterophobia ,0,0
"trish i think your view on who you think you might be is based on society's opinions the reasons you think you might be a male are based on straight masculine men's opinion on you as a girl that's the type you attract and as for you being attracted to gay men it could be an emotional thing you enjoy having sex with anyone not matter their orientation but you might feel like you identify with a gay man because that's who you are attracted too if you want a feminine boyfriend they do exist but the majority of men who are attracted to you seem to be masculine men so you feel thats what you're stuck with"" and as for being penis envy i am too girl i think most women can agree that if they had a penis they would be happier because being a cis male is easy and accepted they can be dominant and assertive and be considered manly and thats normal and bonus points if you're a white cis man because they get everything handed to them being drag looks fun and exciting and they play dress up and you're right they don't always wear a face full of make up but it's their thing that they like to get all glam that doesn't necessarily mean you identify with them you just have the same hobbies i am woman love to put on cute pastel dresses mostly cuz i hate pants lol and wear make up but half the times i don't feel like taking the extra time to do all that.",0,0

"the sex based pay gap is a lie the inference by feminists is that a man and a woman working side by side doing the same job don't get paid equally that is a lie the pay gap is an average of all male and female workers across all careers the reason men as a whole make more than women as a whole is simple you don't see as many women choosing to work dangerous demanding hazardous jobs how many maternity ward nurses are dying from black lung like coal miners do how many social workers are week long shifts non stop like oil rig workers or working construction on buildings with only a harness for weeks without break men also tend to work more hours every week so obviously they'd be paid more equal pay isn't possible unless there's equal effort so ladies if you want the pay gap to decrease stop going to school to be a florist and join a fire academy otherwise shut the hell up and stop saying things like being a mother is the hardest job in the world"" if you can do your job in your pajamas then no it's not the hardest job in the world.",0,0

"please stick to it trish it is so important i have been vegan for a few months and it has made me so much happier whenever you struggle just remember this happiness is when what you think what you say and what you do are in harmony"" if you have even a small amount of compassion for animals which clearly you do this lifestyle will make you appreciate all other species so much more and appreciate life in general just try to listen to your body if you aren't hungry then don't eat if you are hungry then eat even if you just ate a meal don't expect to lose a ton of weight initially your body like mine has a lot of metabolic damage caused from restriction and starvation that will take a little while to reverse be patient with the lifestyle and most importantly remember that it is a lifestyle and not a diet ",0,0

hi blaire i wanted to comment about the trisha situation i can admit honestly that up until now i did not always agree with your message mainly i didn't understand where it was coming from truly i am in a similar spot as some other younger trans people and i have to say things like this do not help it's improper representation of trans people and it's awful how trisha felt the need to capitalize as you mentioned but when this is one of the more trending videos this is what people associate us with and it is hurtful because it does indeed feel like trisha is mocking our very real struggles also i have learned so much about how to discuss these things across your videos overall! that helped me shape my own understanding i just wish at the end of the day we honestly could help eliminate these problems i'm just surprised that gigi being a trans woman herself would support trisha i know her heart is in a extremely good place but it makes me wonder if gigi actually thinks that..,0,0

the other side of it is this in texas a young transman was forced to compete as birthsex female this person was hormonally transitioned into a male and it's stupid and dishonest to say hormone therapy doesn't change your sex characteristics everything will change what you ended up with was the image of a young man with a young girl in a chokehold this young man had begged to compete against men and was not allowed they made him wrestle girls you can look at it and see it's wrong this is also very clearly wrong neither side has this right but i stand flatly in the truth that in the binary the conservative position is always always always patently more stupid.,0,1

this comment section is appalling i'm assuming everyone here is high school educated wage gap men work have higher paying jobs work longer hours etc remember what the equal sign means everyone the wage gap is the fact that men work higher paying jobs work longer hours etc yes there's still straight up discrimination that goes down but that's not the point we have a society and economy that accommodates men more so than women simply because women have kids take on more unpaid responsibilities associated with kids etc women are accommodated less in our economy solely due to the fact they are women and biologically have burdens that men do not birthing children) this is a systemic issue not an individual issue ___ like the video clearly stated a good first step is to make hours more flexible in positions and make paid maternity leave federally legal and required for all women this way women can work longer hours higher payer jobs etc and close the wage gap the amount of misinterpretation in these comments is appalling this is why trump is president americans are dumb ___-,0,0

trisha you are gonna need so much more food than that! im so happy you are going vegan thats amazing! just one more person helping the environment and the animals so i have been vegan for years now and i want you to know that you will thrive off of a vegan diet the fruits you have are great watermelon and grapes are my fav too! but buy some black beans and white/brown rice for a great protein source also tofu is a great source of protein but if you arent a fan of that try the gardein fake meats they are absolutely delicious and have tons of protein but unfortunately they are a bit processed but i recommend getting their orange fake chicken and having that with some rice and stir-fry i promise you it is mouth-watering good also ben and jerry's has vegan icecream yes you can still have many processed foods as a vegan but since you are looking to be a bit healthier get some oats to make oatmeal and coconut sugar with some raisins and bananas is so good!!,0,0

lol thats not really true she twists the data to show what she wants but you can't really expect her to present on wage gap while she's agaisnt feminism while i was working in service early college years i was doing basically nothing but was paid more than my female counterpart the problem with wage gap is that women have lower hourly wage than men this can of course change if you're manager and negotiate about your potential income but if you'll come somewhere for some basic no-school position and they'll offer you less only because you're a women that's the problem.,0,0

good video but i have the feeling it is important to contrast some points  until recently women didn't have the same access to the education or leading position as men actually only one think remained from that period the idea that women are in charge of the children more than men this way of thinking creates a lot of problem because entering in trouble with going up the career ladders for women as a woman you are really more likely to be less available for your job than men  again because men have been used to occupate leader positions men are still now doing more studies related to this women on the contrary will do study according to the image built given to her linked to their housing task listen take care and so on.. explaining why they are more often following those studies to conclude i would say that facts presented in that video are true but i think we still need to change the way we see women in the society in my opinion it just cannot be denied that this salary gap is not directly wanted anymore but still due to a wrong old patriarchal way of thinking.,0,0

men make more money than women on average but that's only because the very top successful men have enough money to cover up the unsuccessful men the overwhelming majority of the homeless population are men the overwhelming majority of plumbers landscapers garbage truck drivers mailmen and construction workers low paying jobs are almost all male dominated women actually occupy most of the median jobs in society and yes a big reason for the wage gap is that men ask for raises more than women but if you look at the statistics men are significantly fired more than women because they take those risks additionaly there is biology to consider successful men will almost always have options to female partners while unsuccessful men will have much less females do not need to be successful or accomplished to be desired by men so there is less of a demand for it just because the numbers arent the same doesnt mean there is a great injustice being perpetuated by a grand evil superpower think with your brain not your heart.,0,0

"title there is no gender wage gap"" :2 the wage gap is .6 ..huh it is very true that many people use the 3 wage gap number without any nuance or detail and that number is misleading to the point of being wrong but arguing against the weakest version of your opponent's argument is not very impressive the better informed concerns over the wage gap focus on career choices particularly at universities it's true that better paying college degrees are pursued disproportionately by men and this video simply states it and moves on this is the heart of the question though so.. why do men pursue these degrees at higher rates then women are parents teachers others in society subconsciously steering girls away from the boring nerdy stuff is this a case of the soft bigotry of low expectations do in-school and after-school programs that teach extra-curricular like cad programming electronics etc.. lean towards recruiting boys instead of girls are the teachers of these programs disproportionately men resulting in more role models for boys than for girls does networking through alumni favor male grads because most of the alumni in well-paying fields are alumni creating a kind of inertia that subconsciously favors male over female grads does society place far more pressure on women to marry younger and raise kids leading couples to split child-rearing duties unevenly and slowing done women's careers concerns about the gender gap are commonly dismissed as nothing more than a pipeline problem there are certainly feminists who want to make more out of this than simply a pipeline problem but a pipeline problem is still a problem and in my opinion a substantial one at that realists who want to solve this problem are trying to make schools parents and society as a whole aware with the hope that girls feel like stem degrees are a choice for them but this video it breaks the 3 gap down just enough to get to the answer it's looking for but not enough to acknowledge or delve into the heart of the question this video leads one to think that there's no problem here the reality is that a deeper understanding of the issue requires finding answers to the questions i outlined above deciding if those answers reveal problems that need to be fixed and taking action as needed.",0,0

um..i think this along with most of her issues stem fm a deep deep seeded childhood trauma/issue im a firm believer in freud's theory that children's personalities develope through the stages freud proposed that psychological development in childhood takes place during five psychosexual stages oral anal phallic latency and genital i think something happened during trisha's early childhood...around or yrs old and im not saying sexual abuse though im not ruling that out.. but something happened and that's why she has no self control..her id gets what her id wants she has stated she needs sex to times a day that she just pulsates for no reason and needs sex often she goes into self destruction mode when in a relationship and fm the start of a relationship starts pushing that person away while at the same time being super ultra clingy..has talked about her drug use her drinking her eating addiction...her impulsivity..her being attractive to way older men.. and i think it all goes back to her early childhood i just wonder what the fuck her therapist talks to her about?!? she needs a doctor to delve into her mind..not just a therapist she needs a psychologist!,1,0

vox will make a five and a half minute video to sustain a feminist myth it's an earnings gap and notice how they never compare people working the same jobs for the same employers yet you'll never see a video about how there's only about an  disparity between men and women in being the recipient domestic abuse which is actually likely much less considering men are far less likely to report not to mention many care facilities for domestic abuse victims will turn male victims away simply on the basis of sex then there's also the rate of male rape victims and female theyre extraordinarily close hardly anyone in the media spotlight talks about that certainly not vox or on the subject of work itself how women have two to one odds to men for being chosen for stem fields in the name of equality. plus we have built educational programs to encourage women into fields like physics science and math i can tell you with certainty that men do not receive these support systems also most important of all wage discrimination is made constitutionally illegal by the 4th amendment and reaffirmed by equal rights of the 0s also maybe this thing called evolutionary biology puts women in the role of primary cause y know they're the ones popping out the babies if you want to be seen as a credible news organization vox then tell the full story and maintain some ethics in reporting.,0,0

fuck the lgbtfacist,1,1
another thing that you notice about feminists is that they often have this toxicity and hostility in debates as soon as you disagree with something they say and counter it with facts you're just an offended and insecure and most importantly mansplaining broflake or something like that basically all the time when a dude disagrees with something a feminist says he is instantly met with ad hominem attacks or other forms of highly arrogant and almost narcissistic answers i can't recall a feminist that actually started to engage in a discussion in which he/she actually replied to my comments it basically always follows this scheme . initial comment based on perceived truths . countering that statement with actual facts . ad hominem attacks and bringing up more unproven claims while ignoring the facts from the first answer . countering the new claims with facts as well . fleeing into conspiracy like excuses example well the patriarchy raises us like that!!!! when you showcase how the pay gap is a result from individual choices and further ignoring the stated facts or simply claiming they are wrong without providing facts and evidence to support the claim that the aforementioned facts are really wrong,0,0

so here's what i'm thinking atm.. i don't think she's transgender. at all. but i do think this is coming from a place of her not having a total grasp on who she truly is not that i can say that i do either there's something psychologically not right with her.. i believe i think her career and poor decisions/drug use has probably made it worse or she's trolling but i'm kind of starting to think her issues run deeper than previous thought.,0,0
hey i was wondering if anyone has any advice or anything i've been vegan for about six months and recently i got a stress fracture in my foot every time i tell someone they just say oh drink some milk or oh it must be because you're lacking calcium. i know it probably doesn't have anything to do with veganism and my doctor even says it doesn't but i was just wondering if anyone has had any similar problems or if anyone could tell me if there actually is a correlation and i should be doing something different,0,0

the reason this question is much more controversial than it should be is because of this is there a gender gap yes this is a 00 undeniable truth and we have the statistics to back it up men do earn more than women this is the reality but the controversy is not about the fact that it exists but the reason to it and as the video clearly states this gap exist more due to the career choices men and women make than an evil men conspiracy there will always be a gender gap and sometimes it will swing in one way and sometimes another because we are all individuals are women stupid for choosing a career they enjoy no women tend to work to live while men tend to live to work and that makes the women far more intelligent in my book that said would love to see more women in my field embedded programming).. ),0,0

i actually have a personal story that could shed some light on the unexplained wage gap after calculations my mother was the gm of an advertising company and she had many agents working under but two stood out they both worked the same amount of hours and overtime they both had the same quality of work and had similar qualifications and contracts and one was a man the other a woman and they had both been working around a year and a half one day the woman discovered that the man mad about percent more than her though they had the same position and bonuses when she came to my mother and asked about it she learned it wasn't because of sexism it was very simple the man asked for a raise and got it my mother admitted to the woman that if she had asked for a raise she would have gotten one but because she didn't the guy made more than her on his base salary this is very common in certain fields because men on average have more confidence in the workplace as such they have around a -5x more likelihood of asking for a raise or bonus the woman asked for it and she got it and when my mother was later promoted to senior vp of marketing the man got a promotion to gm why you may ask because he asked for the promotion first and my mother gave it to him as he was a member of the top agents along with the woman the morale of the story is that this smaller wage gap can be explained in certain situations by workplace confidence it is your job to ask for a raise or promotion and not the employer to ask if you want one because confidence and decisiveness in the workplace can trump credentials almost 0 of the time i hope you can all learn from the woman's mistake and use it forward in your career.,0,0

in order to close the gender pay gap make the total earnings of women the same as mens you'd have to stop women from having babies so being that the only set of countries where this lunacy is being pushed is western countries what's being advocated will result in the end of the white race not to mention laying the precedent for communist equality of outcome society so in short end of the white race and communism and the mainstream media is pushing this out in the west you should be asking who owns and controls the media and why would they want to bring about the end of the white race and introduce jewish invented communism?,1,0

well the only problem is many peoply replace the meat with stuff made of soy all in all good except millions of squaremiles of rainforest gets incinerated to plant soy there and when the soil is deploited they have to incinerate a new piece of forest to get new land for their agriculture and the dead soil they leave behind doesn't get enough time to recover and becomes a degradated forest we can't continue this th rainforest is the biggest carbondioxide storage of our planet and destroying it sets all this carbondioxide free to damage our climate even more if we want to save the planet soy isn't a choice even though of course most of the soy isn't even consumed by the human we still have to care about where the stuff we consume comes from,0,0

you know i am not a fan of what every single thing feminist say but there is a wag gap it is a fact that the wage gap exist it just is a fact the wage gap and if you talk to people who understand the wage gap they will tell you this takes into consideration or account different choices men and women make such as job position total hours worked also number of children and the frequency at which unpaid leave is taken in addition to other factors they do take into account the type of degree one receives in college every feminist knows this but what feminist also bring up that people hate hearing which is a real factor that exist is discrimination which accounts for 0 of the wage gap according to the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the u.s has the 2th largest gender pay gap overall and the gap in this country is bigger than the gap in most european countries the economic policy institute says in simple terms no matter how you measure it there is a gap. also the reason women make the choices they do get the college degrees they do could be the result of a sexist culture maybe not saying that is the case.,0,0

yes the wage gap seems real and this video makes a good explanation that the women usually spend more time on the children thus they would get less money for work with specific hours but i dont get how this is that big of a problem as some people make it out to be when most women with children also have a husband who can use that extra money he makes to support the whole family.,0,0

"those images at :2 don't say women do more than men to raise kids in two parent households they show that equal plus father does more""together 47+6 outweighs mother does more 47) so in 3 of households the father is doing the same or more than the mother of course when you say mom does more 47 vs dad does more 6 it looks like dads do x less work and if you run the graphics by quickly and say that out loud while you do it adds even more to the misleading nature the only category of the three presented where mom does more is taking care of sick kid mom 4 equal 9 dad does more )  is greater than 6 that's hardly a shocking indictment of fathers everywhere then you have to make the leap from those numbers to pay when it isn't clear how that would directly translate into earnings of someone  years out of business school.",0,0

not a bad documentary and i'm really happy that it doesn't only highlights the positive side but also talks about possible arguments against veganism and disproves them afterwards but i've got the feeling that it's mostly focussing on the economical part although i think it would be much more beneficial to shed light on the concrete impacts on our environment i see the focus here mostly on famous representatives of the vegan communities and less on the actual reasons why people should go vegan nevertheless i think it is awesome that youtube has now free documentaries as well and that even the ones without netflix can inform themselves about the plant-based diet.,0,0

so yesterday i was discussing this subject with my girlfriend and i explained all of this but even though she agreed she came up with an argument i found difficult to refute even if you consider same jobs same position working hours and total time working at a company companies ran by elder males tend to favor career ascension to men instead of women therefore making them earn more mainly because they still live in the past and as a man i have to say i've heard about these cases maybe they don't provide an overall big gender gap but they are a reality thoughts on this?,0,0

thanks you for being objective but is any of this accounting for how women on average work less hours overall or are less likely to push for longer hours and promotions and what about manual labor any kind of gap would be generated by the fact that there are significantly less women in those fields but i'm sure findings will reveal that on an hour to hour basis the place to begin that women make exactly as much by the hour.. seeing as anything other then equal pay is illegal and institutions and organizations exist to enforce that the gap is misrepresenting the stats by the fewer collective hours otherwise the bbb or someone would be stepping in which goes to show you can't fix something that isn't broken if i could fix anything it would be that feminism would be defined as superiority instead of equality since it's not about equality it's about revenge things were so unequal for so long that now they have to be unequal the otherway instead of balanced like they should.,0,0
so the gender wage gap does exist but there are many variables and no apparent reason why,0,0
trish i'm so glad you are deciding to try veganism for protein you can try eating beans/legumes and whole grains vegetables also contain protein you just need to eat higher volumes of vegetables because they have less calories and even though your goal is weight loss you can try mock meat and cheeses every once and a while whenever you are craving animal products for starbucks you can order your drinks with soy and it tastes just as yummy good luck,0,0
"coming from a gender-fluid person to me it sounds like she might be genderfluid or maybe non-binary also people using the pronoun they don't have disassociate personality disorder i use they/them pronouns personally for several reasons it feels a lot more neutral to me and i prefer that sometimes people using her and he make me feel highly uncomfortable and i know it's not right so i use they/them because i feel like it fits me more also they is used as a singular pronoun a lot in english when you don't know someone's gender you use they/them' like if someone said oh it's my friend's birthday today"" a perfectly normal response would be oh tell them i said happy birthday!"" ergo they/them can be used as a singular pronoun and a lot of people feel more comfortable with that and that's a-okay.",0,0

my biggest advice is to start by eating normally meaning continue to eat the food you loved to eat before eat on vegan restaurants search for vegan replacement products etc to start with and get used to it to not feel like something is missing if you do good without it don't but make sure to eat enough carbs proteins fiber calcium etc don't listen to supposed healthy diet that won't last long just as raw til  this one is made for people who want to maintain their weight or who have a hella fast metabolism which i guess is not yours just as it wasn't mine because i have always been rounder and this does'nt work for that type of body meaning that even if i'm thin i will still be rounder or curvier what works for me and people i know is just to continue eating normal and don't go with the extreme healthy vegan diets yet raw diet raw til ... good luck ,0,0

this isint bulletproof like most people say at least in what is seen in this video alone the real takeaway at least the one i got is that wemen prefer eaiser less time consuming jobs to men the real question then becomes why why do they act this way if its simple biology then it seems as if even though a wage gap does exist its not due to any controllable factors but what if its for another reason what it wemen act this way beacuse of societys expectations if thats the case then there really is still work feminists have to do to make wemen feel more at ease in workplaces personally i think thats not supported at all from what we know about female biology but like she says there are so many variables and answers im not willing to count that argument 00 out yet.,0,0

totally unfair one of them was completing in mens track a month prior dont know of an argument that can be made that makes this fair especially if its a girl who is looking for a scholarship and loses out because of these two the transgender parents think their kids happiness is more important than the happiness of another child which is telling then the trans kids echo the sentiment when asked if they were on the receiving end like those that are biologically female their answer as long as the kids that are transgender are happy than that should make me happy not said in those words but that was the sentiment. and i dont care of they take hormone therapy for a couple,1,0

what gets me is how much work these evil companies have put into hiding this heinous crime they commit i think if everyone knew all the graphic details of what factory farms do most would at least cut back animal consumption that's why these companies go out of their way to make sure we cant find this information easily i'm one of the most curious people you will ever meet i have spent time researching almost everything including looking up silly/random topics like the history of watermelon. but these companies go so far out of their way to hide this evil that even someone like me never stumbled up to this topic by myself my sister mentioned it to me a year ago and that's when i researched and learned about this horror even as a lifelong meat eater who loves meat and comes from a meat based culture i couldn't morally continue to partake in this evil i have been vegan since and will never touch meat again i'm very old school and grew up with the idea that men never cry or show emotions. i'm basically the stereotypical tough guy who almost never shows emotions but ever since i learned about this evil act every once in a while it comes into my head and all i want to do curl up into a ball and weep for the poor defenseless animals that we torture so mercilessly we have to invent a new word for what we do to these poor animals because even the word evil doesn't cut it.,0,0

 this message is really long and i hope the creators of this video will take out some minutes from their time to read it i genuinely think these are valid arguments and i promise this is not hate thank you and sorry(for the long comment well i guess it's time to trap you in your own statistics vox as you mentioned about the job of a pharmacist you should that women earned 2 of what men did where is the other % as you mentioned that now there are more flexible hours and she can work on hours suitable so the variable of a kid is gone whether a woman has a kid or not so in theory according to you the wage gap should not exist between pharmacists but it does so what could possibly be the reason of the missing % another thing in the statistics you showed about different types of jobs tech business and one other it is true that tech has a shrinked up wage gap but i most certainly saw some green dots on the middle range too if a woman is doing her job completing experiments and whatever else is done on labs then why are there some positions in the tech itself that have an existing wage gap now going on to the study of mba students the one between 99 and 006) now this time most variables are same the women have the exact same qualifications as the men and is most cases even the same age as men so now tell me even after that why are woman paid 500 less than men yes the wage gap is considerably less in this scenario and that is really great but why is there a difference at all this all is regardless whether a woman has a kid or not or even married after all you showed us the statistics of difference of wage gap between woman who have kids and woman who do not agreed that there was a considerable difference but then again the column of women who do not have kids was not zero why not this time there is clear indication that having kids is not the prime reason of women being paid less than men so my final question is if this is clearly not the prime reason then what is?,0,0

"this video proved to me that there is a gender wage gap in the example of the georgetown university top paying majors and least paying majors the out of the top paying majors dominated by women was pharmaceutical science and out of lowest paying majors dominated by women were counseling and psychology early childhood education human services and community organization and social work i think one of the variables that needs to be taken into account is a female's natural aptitudes and their value to society for example the history of stenography and secretarial work demonstrates the history of how a once male-only profession became available to women but at the cost of lower pay because they could secretarial work and stenography was only a male profession colleges that taught these subjects only admitted males historically this is the recent past if you go far back in history the work of scribes a once highly honored position was also the work of males from the book out of the kitchen and into the office by lynn peril a case history of poaching jobs from men unlike typing stenography had a long history of male practitioners in 906 the author of starting in life what each calling offers ambitious boys and young men warned his readers that save for the as yet mostly male bastion of the newspaper office the woman stenographer had become an office fixture and necessity. women had even infiltrated the ranks of court reports where they had been long considered too delicate to hear the litany of greed murder lust and corruption not to mention the occasional indecency of language they might be subjected to when taking trial testimony the reason for women's success as stenographers was obvious, the author concluded so long as the woman continues to work at a lower price than is paid to the man for a similar service the man cannot compete with the woman on what may be assumed to be the woman's ground. he thus warned boys to pause and reflect and then to pause again and to continue to reflect for several days or weeks before entering a profession which has comparatively few prizes to offer and has very little substantial reward even for those who draw a prize. the women it seemed had devalued what once had been a man's noble calling. i hope the above provides a good example of how women's work has been devalued historically and why i as a medical transcriptionist for  years with a 0-year work history in the field of just secretarial work am presently paid the same wages as a garbage truck driver would make at the start of his career if it was up to choice why would i not have chosen to be a garbage truck driver could it possibly be because of the strength requirements i.e. a male's natural aptitude?",0,0

so for women to get paid fairly men trying to negotiate their own pay have to negotiate for their fellow women's pay because what they can't do it themselves ludicrous to think women shouldn't have to do any bargaining when negotiating their pay that when men's contracts get negotiated the women's contracts have to automatically be fulfilled with the same pay without putting forth the same effort the men did kinda goes against same pay for same work ethic.,0,0

the fact of the matter is that when you look at the big picture women generally do not want the same job types as men far more men go into stem jobs like engineering mathematics science and technology those jobs pay way more as a result when you look at the total amount of money earned between men and women men make more but when you account for the differences in job types and education the wage gap vanishes to a much smaller amount  cents per dollar not the  cents claimed) to illustrate this point further white people only make  cents for every dollar that an asian person makes the reason is not because there is some discrimination going on it is the exact same reason that men make more than women as a whole this is because even more asians go into stem jobs than average caucasians wage gaps really have very little to do with discrimination it just so happens that women for whatever reason do not choose to go into higher paying jobs and do not choose to work as much overtime etc and it just so happens that asians go into high paying jobs even more that is why whites make  cents for every dollar than an asian makes and that is why women make  cents per dollar that men make it's just looking at the total amount of money that a group makes it is not accounting for differences in what types of jobs different groups go into it does not account for voluntary overtime differences and it does not take into account educational differences etc it's only looking at the total income of men versus women and this produces a very misleading result.,0,0

one of the variables for the . cents left is maternal verse paternal leave in australia employers are at least legally binned to offer - weeks paternal leave verse something like - weeks i think i'm not 00 sure for maternal leave so even if both people take their maximum allotted leave and come back with their spouse taking care of the child the man will still work more hours the pay given is still equal but less than they would earn than when they're working therefore there is at least part of that . cents probably a large part due to it being not even mentioned in this video,0,0

i don't think you'll see the results you want from going vegan in just weeks i've been on the diet for about months and i've lost  pounds my skin looks clearer no more zits i feel a lot healthier in general it took a long time though to get into a good rhythm with food i did so much research and watched so many food diaries on youtube i think it's a good step but you're not going to reap the benefits you want off of this diet in just weeks you might not even lose weight freelee looks great but she also exercises a lot she's very active i do think as a vegan you need to find a balance your body needs fats and oils which freelee is against i use coconut oil to cook with and extra virgin olive oil i also eat avocados and almonds to get my fats in i still eat between 20 calories a day to 60 depending on my daily activity and because i'm dieting a little i don't think everyone can just eat as many calories as they like from fruit and veggies and lose weight doing it everyone's lifestyle is different get your veggies in for sure my food diary usually consists of eating almonds with all natural organic peanut butter i'll have a smoothie with bananas frozen berries hemp protein almond milk sometimes a date or then other days i'll switch my bananas for an avocado with spinach and berries and coconut water for lunch and dinner i usually eat similar things it could be a veggie burger pasta with veggies quinoa or brown rice with veggies i like spicy foods so if you're like me you'll enjoy this snack i buy peppers and red pepper hummus and just dip peppers into that and omg it's so good if i'm craving chocolate i usually buy some organic dark chocolate put it in the freezer and snap off a piece now and then always make sure you read the back of the label with everything you buy there's lots of information out there immerse yourself in research and you'll do great also if you're craving meat i'd buy meat from morning star or gardien for cheese always go with chao cheese it's the only cheese brand so far that's impressed me don't expect the fake meats and cheese to be identical to the real stuff it's different just still tasty in it's individual way.,0,0
if you have a tattoo you can never be a full vegan as your tattoo has traces of animal products in its creation fact unfortunately all women who got tattoos in early 000s because all their friends got tattoos so their got one so their didn't feal left out now the exact same groups of friends are now trying to be vegans but they never can be because that tattoo you got that you never wanted in st place means no matter how harecore vegan you try to become that tattoo permanently prevents you from ever becoming a true vegan,0,0

i went to a very good high school but it was soooo politically biased my junior english teacher and history teacher in high school were and are best friends extremely intelligent women and now great mothers but they were also the type of feminists to project any information that made them mad even if it wasn't entirely true the wage gap misconception was definitely the most glaring of those offenses by teaching all of their students this misconception both my history class and english class got into debates about feminism also because it was relevant to the curriculum and people used this wage gap as their base of support that showed the inequality among men and women in the workplace today in the process my school basically trained a bunch of smart kids to not think critically and just assume statistics were true or false based on if it agrees with their political views or not clearly this video proves that the wage gap many of my friends and teachers had in mind is not real but is in the form of a much more reasonable statistic if one was to actually look further into the data instead of getting excited about the it thinking it is true and then ignoring the critical thinking process because they want the information to be true all because it supports their cause while i do believe that there should be equality in the workplace there is no way that we can ignore what is actually causing much of the inequality in average pay to sum up this huge comment thank you vox and everyone involved with this video for creating a piece related to feminism with good critical and analytical thinking skills instead of spewing incredibly biased and false feminist stories while you made a lot of feminists look bad for yelling wrong information at people for so long you also made the movement look much better because you acknowledged as a very feminist channel that something many feminists believe is true is not thanks again.,0,0

make sure you're not just eating fruit and veg in a day you need protein and carbs like pastas and rice wholegrain if you want to be healthier) otherwise your body will cling on to the natural sugars in the fruit and you won't loose any weight nuts and lentils are also important also those vegan donuts original chips are good ideas for salt and sugar in limited amounts still need those to be healthy just don't eat too much of them good luck!!!,0,0

hey trish a vegan here ! first off if you want to succeed you absolutely shouldn't even consider not eating as much as you want!! the only way you are going to gain weight on a vegan diet us if you eat oily fatty foods so if you want to lose weight as quickly as possible eliminate all overt fats(avocado nuts seeds coconuts etc that most of their calories come from fat also eat as much while foods as possible like ricepotatoes beans lentils oats and such those are going yo make you satiated and full for a looong time that packaged watermelon shouldn't even be a snack and it is not good a idea to eat it at lunch time bc melons have a high water content so they are best digested if eaten first thing in the morning otherwise you are going to be bloated and gassyüôÑ for example you can eat fruit as breakfast for lunch you can make potato fries that you bake in the oven instead of dunking them in oilüòù you can make rice stir fry with loots of veggies and rice again no oil.. there are endless recepies search around youtube also watch mr&mrs vegan on youtube they are from la and have helped me a looot to understand how to eat properly and have very educational videos hope you continue this after the weeks aaand good luck ,0,0

another parallel between you and i trish i am too attempting to go vegan i hate meat dont like eggs the only think im having a hard time with is dairy milk/cheese i love me some fruits and veggis and nuts and rice and beans etc.. my downfall is sugar which technically is ok to eat when vegan so i need to find some self control on that front... the common mistake i am making is just like when you said you accidentally had starbucks that had milk you have to break the bad habits~ one good thing is that there is so many channels and websites out there to help you know what to eat.... i suggest before going to any food restaurants ie taco bell starbucks cheesecake factory etc.. you check out their menu online and figure out what you will order prior to going i know its easy to be caught up in the whole process and order things that you used to order or you get there and you dont want to hold up the line so you order something without thinking it through you have to remember that its easy to go vegan and stay fat trust me i know this i too am about 00lbs too and i too hope to get healthier through going vegan) french fries are vegan but when you get them say from mcdonalds or bk they are soaked in salt then salted again and again and again when being served then the fried aspect on top of that.. i know you know this i just used that as an example . usually. hardcore vegans arent vegans to be skinny. they are vegan because they are against all animal cruelty. then the health benefits are just a plus you can get vitamins too to help you make sure youre getting everything your body needs maybe freelee can help with telling you which you should take while doing this week vegan diet love you bunches trisha and i know you can do it dont cheat,0,0
i went to a place called the gentle barn in santa clarita i fed horses chickens hugged cows afterwards we went out to eat and i couldn't bring myself to eat meat that was over a year ago and i have found so many yummy things to eat by doing a lot of research online it's helped my waistline and my life in general give it a chance and i wish you lots of luck!,0,0
"freelee can eat a ton of calories because she excersizes like crazy and she's superrrr fit the key to the raw till diet that she promotes is eating a ton of carbs in the form of fruit veg rice and potatoes and excersizing hardcore for an hour a day and being active if you want to loose weight on a vegan diet and not excursive that much you need to lower your caloric intake because your body won't be burning all of those calories off there's no doubt about it though that whole foods especially when they're in their raw form are the best for your body and you will be the healthiest off nutritionally if you're just eating vegan not specifically raw till or excersizing frequently i would suggest to eating so that the bulk of your diet comes from fruit and veggies cooked or uncooked with some brown rice potatoes accompanying it and once in a while adding in some beans and rarely some nuts/seeds you don't have to worry about protein deficiency because it literally doesn't exist since everything you eat has protein in it don't cook with any oil and try not to add salt to any food you're eating that's to loose weight if you're going to fall off the wagon and are thinking about stopping being vegan it's good to educate yourself more on the ethical reasons why a vegan diet is so good watching forks over knives gary yourofksy's speech on youtube called the best speech you will ever hear"" earthlings and other things will help also as well if you're feeling like you're going to fall off the wagon because you really want to eat your favourite ___ try looking for a vegan version of that in the grocery store lots of times the vegan version of things are really tasty and helps the transition or have some pasta or bread non-whole foods carb options) these things are not recommended for loosing weight though that's more for the rare treat or once you've reached your goal weight to loose weight cut out the alcohol up your water intake to about -4l a day a big l or l water bottle really helps with this and drink l of that water with lemon each morning before you eat breakfast maybe drink it while you go for a walk first thing after you wake up and then come back to eat) and make sure you're getting adequate sleep and try to avoid stress hope this helps )",0,0

i don't know why but i hate fruit so much i can literally not eat it it just doesn't taste good for me i have really bad and unhealthy eating habits for example a warm meal without meat isn't a good meal for me that's why i could never be vegan since i consume so much meat it's unbelievable but i'm not hating on vegans they're cool.‚úå,0,0

baby steps i feel like you're doing it all in one go and you have a lifetime of habits to change in order to fully transition give yourself a chance i think that making good lifestyle choices like picking the right products to consume over food that is bad for your body is a great thing i wish your reasons were less superficial but then again we are guilty of that in my opinion changing your diet around like this should be more about what you enjoy eating that is good for your body and soul which doesn't always mean that you need to become vegan it is entirely possible to live a vegan lifestyle but the lack of nutrients that you get from animal products may affect you in the long run you should consider yourself lucky if it happens sooner than that so that you can try something else until you find something that works for you lastly the argument we were never supposed to eat animal product is bullocks honestly just look at the structure of your teeth front teeth are sharper-edged to tear into meat easier the back teeth are from grinding your food until you are able to swallow which also aids your digestion herbivores aka vegans of the animal kingdom have flat/dull teeth because flora and fauna do not require the shredding action of sharper teeth i hope this is helpful in any way and if i may ask please do not follow all of freelee's dietary advice especially not because it works for her and she's super skinny now she has no training or education on this subject at all please consult a physician and a dietitian to figure out what foods you should eat and which you should avoid according to your body type and the current state of your health i highly recommend this last part you should always seek professional advice from certified practitioners tldr freelee is full of shit eat the health foods that you genuinely enjoy talk to an actual doctor and an actual dietitian.,0,0

so proud of you trish its so great that you want to eat healthfully instead of starving yourself to loose weight please remember though that you might not loose weight within two weeks and i hope you'll stick with veganism anyway we all know that weight loss doesn't happen overnight and takes months or years so please don't give up on being vegan if you don't see fast results my tips for being and staying vegan are  fuck all the vegan diets like rt sorry freelee) fully raw etc all you need to do is eat whole plant foods by this i mean basically anything from the produce section of the store also beans legumes lentils pasta rice oats  try new things find a recipe that looks yummy and make it try to veganize your old favorites try the vegan meat/cheese alternatives know that there will be things you love and things you hate but that's just a part of the process  prepare food ahead of time make sure you have something to snack on or have lunch prepared before you get hungry so you don't give up and get fast food or something this also applies to going out to eat research the menu ahead of time so your not flustered when you get there  read all the labels every single packaged thing you buy please read the labels never assume that something is vegan companies love to sneak milk fat or skim milk into everything  it's not just about you i know you are doing this mainly for health reasons which is completely fine but it's so helpful to remember and think about all the lives you are saving by eating this way when it gets tough just know you are helping animals and the earth  i really hope this helps you trish i'm so happy for you Ô∏è,0,0

the video kinda proved that the pay gap doesn't exist by itself however let me rephrase it women are paid less on average because they make different lifestyle choices like working dangerous jobs in remote areas what the video asserts is the solution is to change the way businesses operate to suit workers while this is ideal for getting rid of a number previously proven to mean nothing the gender wage gap this will never happen as meetings are not scheduled around home life and if they are they will be erratic and inefficient as such while this is one example i think the message that should be taken from one of vox's best political videos is that the wage gap is while a fact not one that is directly indicative of the common implication that men are paid more.,0,0

"the 7-cents-on-the-dollar statistic is calculated by dividing the median earnings of all women working full-time by the median earnings of all men working full-time in other words if the average income of all men is say 0,00 dollars a year and the average annual income of all women is say 0,80 dollars that would mean that women earn  cents for every dollar a man earns 0,80 divided by 0,00 equals 77 but these calculations don't reveal a gender wage injustice because it doesn't take into account occupation position education or hours worked per week even a study by the american association of university women a feminist organization shows that the actual wage gap shrinks to only . cents when you factor in different choices men and women make and the key word here is choice. the small wage gap that does exist has nothing to do with paying women less let alone with sexism it has to do with differences in individual career choices that men and women make.",0,0

"i am not a feminist and this video does set some facts.. but without drawing the conclusions from them i have to say that  as a woman i observe that men are sometimes if not regularly macho towards women even in a way that they may perceive as normal or harmless i don't believe it's always purposely mean.. but therefore they do not respect women entirely while it's much more more rare that a woman would have any kind of despise towards men just for being men women usually value men as much as themselves..  if it's true that women often make choices that lead them to less well payed jobs it's partly because they are surrounded by social messages that tell them some jobs are for men and they wouldn't fit in it i'm not saying it's caused by all men nor that all women suffer from it.. but it's true for a certain prcrentage of people, and may explain the unexplained wage gap in this video which is ridiculously presented as unexplained while the answer is i'm sorry quite obvious and quite real.. once again i'm not saying that women are all oppressed by men but men make the more social oppression as they make the more sexual assaults.. take this as a remark from someone who doesn't care about gender when looking at someone but about respect and truth",0,0

i don't get the hate from the usual subjects according to their standards trisha is trans and we must accept that despite her not making any effort to transition if she claims that she is trans or any other gender identity that is obviously the only thing that matters and we have to play along with that so as to not trigger an instance of dysphoria otherwise we are obviously being transphobic at least gigi is being principled by playing along because the rest of the left sure isn't lmao!,0,0

this is brilliant! my biggest tip is to be brave and stand up for what you believe in no matter who your audience educate yourself on the ethical environmental and health benefits of a vegan lifestyle so when people try to mock this cruelty free way of life you know the actual facts not the widespread propaganda) buy in bulk e.g potatoes rice pasta fruit veggies nuts legumes frozen fruit plant milk etc lastly make sure you carb the fuck up! carbohydrates are not the enemy!!!!!!!!!!,0,0

i won't be speaking in favour or against the wage gap argument but the methods used to compare whether there is a wage gap or no is idiotic at best it's common sense to not use averages how about you take two people of the same profession working the same job in the same company with the only difference being their gender and see how much they earn per hour and not the total wage per month and then repeat that process over and over again with different jobs and companies only then can someone say whether the wage gap is still present or no.,0,0

it's a very poor goal to eliminate the wage gap it's far more important for people to choose what they want to do rather than have collectivists decide for you what you should do so that on a graph it looks like things are equal things are never equal not between genders not between races heck i have poor eyesight and couldn't become a pilot if i wanted to the point is that people get somewhat equal opportunities and get to make the choices of what they want to do not have some regressive outlet prescribe that we need to businesses shaped in a specific way so that aggregate earnings of men and women are equal what a stupendously poor goal.,0,0

trish this is so amazing i'm so excited for you from one vegan to a now vegan in my opinion any reason to change your diet to veganism is a good reason i went mostly for ethical reasons but losing weight and toning up happens regardless if you're trying this out for two weeks in order to feel a little slimmer for your shoot try to only drink water lemon water will help a ton to lose bloating that might occur when increasing your vegetable/fruit intake eat when youre hungry please please do not restrict freelee is right you can eat as much as you want if youre eating a plant based diet raw or not the first week you might be a little gassy or a little bloated but don't let this discourage you! by the end of week two your body will have adapted a lot more to the new diet so you should be waking up looking nice tight i hope you see this as i want you to be successful in this as it can be a total and complete game changer quinoa beans and any dark green vegetable will be high in protein i encourage you to look up vegan recipes to play around with it's fun and don't be afraid to try different vegan restaurants in your area they can open your eyes as to how wonderful food on this lifestyle can be good luck trish and keep digging around youtube and the internet for vegans that inspire you muah xx,0,0

of course the meat eaters react negatively eating meat makes them more confrontational using the reptilian brain that was not part of our original dna but put there the vegan has overcome that and shut it down we need to be careful to not fuel that divide and conquer mentality we need to stay calm and focused feeding this planet our higher vibrations so in turn we can liberate mother earth.,0,0
i also think that there can be a massive shift in the impact of the meat and dairy markets if non vegans simply cut out one day or more of animal consumption non vegans having a vegan day in the week equals same no vegan meals as vegan no i'm genuinely wondering if this would have an impact.,0,0

the truth is that freelee is good at what she does and she's a good enough leader for the vegan movement there's always room for improvement in everything and everybody) being completely positive would be nice in a puppies sunshine world that we don't live in it would be good for her image but the truth is that controversy sparks people's interest and that's what freelee does she speaks up questions calls people out on their bullshit she does shit/ sitting back and making what i eat in a day videos is fine i love those videos too but veganism needs exposure most people aren't vegan not because they don't want to but because they're clueless as to what's really happening and freelee plays an important role in just that raising awareness and since the youtube community and the world in general if you ask me is fueled by drama and controversy that is exactly what she does and she's pretty good at it say what you will but she's authentic at the end of the day she does what has to be done and she's honest about it keep rocking.,0,0

the wage gap was so misrepresented and basically a lie that outlets like vox are trying to salvage any last bit of legitimacy from it the problem is that the implied argument about fairness was never true why because the argument was tried in my view to try and subsidize female workers at the expense of male workers that was the plan all along something for nothing.,0,0
the biggest lie by omission of the gender wage gap is that it does not take into account the fact that men work more hours than women so in other words women are getting less money for fewer hours of work which is as it should be.,0,0

also it's illegal to pay a woman less so there's that too.,0,0
this is a complex issue yes gender discrimination happens and yes women are probably paid less than a man because of their sex however there are many things that contribute to the .77 for a  a man makes. some of it is measurable such as education but some of it you can't measure the best way is to take a company with roughly the same experience same college education and than performance indicators to indicate if their is a true gender income inequality right wing will tell you it doesn't exist left will tell you it does but how many will admit it's somewhere in the middle it's probably not nearly as bad as the left portrays but it does exist probably in the tiniest amount.,0,0
i'd rather like to see bell curves of income-distribution rather than merely talking about averages the issue eludes me at large the grand overall gap between the genders is irrelevant as except for this video the grand biological impact of children is almost always glossed over and the mother who doesn't want to focus on her little bundle of cries and diapers is nothing but a bad parent those times are what social security systems/policies are for the only real relevant part is are you getting the same per hour for the same quality of work and the opposite is illegal in most civilised countries anyway if your quality lacks and therefore you get less than your peers and that's not enough for you look for a job that better suits your skillset a world where everyone is required to work shouldn't exist that is just a tyrannical exploitative hell i'm completely fine when one partner whoever it is is able to sustain their family alone freeing the other to focus on the family.,0,0
from most studies i've read through the data seems to always point towards childbirth most women have to take quite a few weeks off because of this phenomena so when they return their income tends to lessen compared to if they didn't therefore one of the easier ways to end the wage gap is to give paid family leave to the mothers and fathers so the wages don't decrease upon the parents return to work this will also add a much healthier relationship between fathers and their children and take the edge off of the average working class wife who has to return to their job after giving birth to realize her salary has just dropped compared to their coworkers.,0,0

wage gap discussion tend to gravitate around these facts but shouldn't the real discussion be around what drives us toward these choices in life if we're being taught into specific roles values and norms from the very young age these will surely have an effect on our career choices young girls who have technical parents role models will more likely statistics aim for technical field girls who don't have these role models are more likely to go into the fields society media culture etc. advertises for them what stops women from applying stem degrees/careers? isn't really an effective question now is it the same logic applies for boys and men too of course edit the points in this video are facts yes.,0,0
men are less privileged than women in the us they spend more time in prison for the same crime if charged with rape they will almost definitely be sent to jail guilty or not and if they aren't they can be fired from their job for a false accusation if they are divorced they have a high chance of losing custody of children they are expected to do more dangerous jobs and risk their lives in things hardly any women would do in first world countries they are called sexist for just being male and are overall hated by feminazis,1,1

i personally connect with some of what that chick is saying though calling herself trans.. no.. its like she is rubbing the fact shw is born the gender she identifies as in the faces of every trans person basically luaghing at their struggle i share some of the same feelings she mentions i often fantasize about being male however i am happy with my gender so no way can i call myself trans that chick definitely trolling or she really believes she is if the latter she has some unknown issue that hasnt been discovered and given a name yet.,0,0

i'm pleasantly surprised at this video from vox also the gender wage gap to the dollar is actually around cents less than men this is as the video states partially due to child bearing and raising a family but there is more to this part of it can also be women being told you'll only make this much compared to men because of the wage gap so they don't strive to succeed more or perhaps move into a lesser job or even worse go into gender studies and only spend their life cursing the frightening patriarchy men generally being more aggressive when it comes to jobs as in more actively asking for a raise or promotion.,0,0
tl;dr the wage gap is produced by women's choices not discrimination were it otherwise companies would only hire women to pay them less and save 21 on their labor costs...duh?,0,0
